HYDRO1k provides a suite of geo-referenced data sets, both raster and vector, which will be of value for all users who need to organize, evaluate, or process hydrologic information on a continental scale. Developed at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center , the HYDRO1k project's goal is to provide to users, on a continent by continent basis, hydrologically correct DEMs along with ancillary data sets for use in continental and regional scale modeling and analyses."

KNB,EML,00516-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Each year, the Inyo County Water Department monitors vegetation conditions on the floor of the Owens Valley. The primary goal of this monitoring, according to the technical appendix to the Long-Term Water Agreement (Green Book) are to detect any “significant decreases and changes in Owens Valley vegetation from conditions documented in 1984 to 1987”. Vegetation live cover and species composition documented during the 1984-87 mapping effort were adopted as the baseline for comparison with each annual reinventory according to the Agreement. The reference measurements collected within individual areas mapped with similar vegetation (parcels) are referred to as baseline. The Green Book details certain decreases and changes in vegetation community types that must be avoided under the Agreement. Baseline vegetation communities in which evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation were classified as groundwater-dependent communities and are referred to as Types B, C, and D. These phreatophytic communities are dependent on shallow groundwater to maintain plant populations, as precipitation alone is inadequate to meet the water demand of evaporation and transpiration (Sorensen et al. 1991, Steinwand et al. 2006). For these parcels, according to the Green Book, “the goal is to manage groundwater pumping and surface water management practices so as to avoid causing significant decreases in live vegetation cover” and to prevent a significant amount of vegetation from changing to a “vegetation type that precedes it alphabetically (for example, Type D changing to either C, B, or A vegetation).” The goal is to manage the effect of pumping on the depth to groundwater to maintain baseline plant communities. To determine whether significant decreases and/or changes in vegetation have occurred, three criteria need to be met that are described in the Green Book: (1) measurability of vegetation change, (2) attributability of vegetation change to LADWP groundwater pumping or surface water management and (3) degree of significance defined by the magnitude, extent, duration and permanency of the change along with other factors including air quality, human health, impact to species of concern, etc. To avoid confusion, it is noteworthy to highlight that the standard dictionary definition of “measurability” is the degree to which something can be measured. Vegetation of course can be measured and thus the first criteria for determining significant decreases or changes in vegetation may seem to the reader unfamiliar with the Green Book, unnecessary. However, the Green Book assigns a different definition to the term “measurability”—defined in part as a change that is statistically significant. Thus the first criteria, measurability, can be used interchangeably with statistical significance in the context of the technical appendix (Green Book) to the Agreement. A main objective of the vegetation annual report is to evaluate the statistical significance (measurability) of vegetation change compared to baseline. The second criterion, evaluating whether a statistically significant change in vegetation is caused by water management (attributability), is beyond the scope of this report owing to the need for a comprehensive analysis on a case by case basis for each vegetation parcel. Another source of confusion may arise with the third criterion which is the “degree or significance” of environmental change. For this criterion to be met, statistical significance is necessary but not sufficient. As described above, there are several other factors in addition to statistical significance that must be demonstrated to evaluate the degree of significance for the third criterion. For an example of a comprehensive evaluation of all three criteria for an individual parcel, see the report “Analysis of Conditions in Vegetation Parcel Blackrock 94” (available at www.inyowater.org). A large proportion of groundwater-dependent parcels were mapped during baseline as Type C alkali meadows (61%), and the Agreement seeks to prevent these meadows from changing to shrub-dominated communities (Type B), a state change that is associated with increased depth to groundwater. Alkali meadows are of special concern because small increases in depth to groundwater can decouple the groundwater from the root zone of grass species (Naumberg et al. 1996, Elmore et al. 2006). Alkali meadow comprises 0.1% of the vegetation community types in California and 80% of alkali meadow communities are located within the Owens Valley (Davis et al. 1998). Local management of this community type will determine the likelihood these ecosystems persist in a changing environment. Vegetation change across the Owens Valley was evaluated at both the valley scale and for each of 111 individual parcels sampled in 2013. First, at the valley-wide scale we evaluated plant community cover and composition in parcels affected by groundwater pumping and for parcels that were relatively unaffected by groundwater pumping during the period of maximum pumping rate (1987-1993). Second, we assessed whether transpiring vegetative cover differed over time for locations influenced by pumping compared to locations not influenced by groundwater pumping. Third, we quantitatively assessed the divergence of these groups of parcels from the baseline cover values recorded from 1984 to 1987. Fourth, we assessed whether vegetation composition in wellfield or control groups had changed from baseline values. Lastly, since determination of significant impacts attributed to water management by LADWP is made on a case by case basis at the individual parcel scale, we (a) quantified the magnitude of change in perennial vegetation cover over the twenty-three year reinventory period, (b) assessed whether the relative proportion of woody vegetation (hereafter shrub), gramminoid vegetation (hereafter grass) and non-gramminoid herbaceous vegetation (hereafter herb) has changed compared to baseline and (c), quantified the temporal trends of vegetation composition for each parcel and evaluated what environmental factors explained the observed patterns in vegetation change."

Each site was split into distinct zones base on dominant sessile organisms that were characteristic of the zones. The zones are as follows, starting from high to low; High Chthamalus, mid Chthamalus, low Chthamalus, high Colpomenia, and mid Colpomenia. Ten meter transects were run parallel to the waters edge. A total of 31 transects were run, 4 from the High Chthamalus, 5 from the mid Chthamalus, 7 from the low Chthamalus 13 from the high Colpomenia, 2 from the mid Colpomenia. Of the 400 specimens found, 8 species were identified. These species were Ophionereis annulata, Ophiactis simplex, Ophactis savignyi, Ophiocoma aethiops, Ophiocoma alexanderi, Ophioderma panamense, Ophioderma teres, and Ophiothrix spiculata. The following information was recorded for each specimen: o Species o Diameter of disk o Length of arm span o The substrate that it was found on o If they are under a rock, if so how big o If it was found in water o If it is regenerating arms and if so how many o If more then 50% of the regenerating arms were missing Possible paper topics: o Arm regeneration in relation to species, substrate, or disk diameter of each individual. o Density, size, and species abundance as a function of zonation."

HYDRO1k provides a suite of geo-referenced data sets, both raster and vector, which will be of value for all users who need to organize, evaluate, or process hydrologic information on a continental scale. Developed at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center , the HYDRO1k project's goal is to provide to users, on a continent by continent basis, hydrologically correct DEMs along with ancillary data sets for use in continental and regional scale modeling and analyses."

KNB,EML,00526-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The ECHAM climate model has been developed from the ECMWF atmospheric model (therefore the first part of its name: EC) and a comprehensive parameterisation package developed at Hamburg therefore the abbreviation HAM) which allows the model to be used for climate simulations. The model is a spectral transform model with 19 atmospheric layers and the results used here derive from experiments performed with spatial resolution T42 (which approximates to about 2.8 degrees longitude/latitude resolution). The model has also been used at resolutions in the range T21 to T106. ECHAM4 is the current generation in the line of ECHAM models (Roeckner, et al., 1992). A summary of developments regarding model physics in ECHAM4 and a description of the simulated climate obtained with the uncoupled ECHAM4 model is given in Roeckner et al. (1996). The initial sea surface temperature and sea-ice data is the COLA/CAC AMIP SST and sea-ice data set. The mean terrain heights are computed from high resolution US Navy data set. The fraction of grid area covered by vegetation based on the Wilson and Henderson-Sellers (1985) data set. The ocean albedo is a function of solar zenith angle and the land albedo from the satellite data of Geleyn and Preuss (1983). A diurnal cycle and gravity wave-drag is included. The time-step of the model is 24 minutes, except for radiation which uses two hours. The ocean model is an updated version of the isopycnal model (OPYC3) developed by Josef Oberhuber (Oberhuber, 1993) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany. The name OPYC is derived from Ocean and isoPYCnal co-ordinates. The concept to use isopycnals as the vertical co-ordinate system for an OGCM is based on the observation that the interior ocean behaves as a rather conservative fluid. Even over long distances the origin of water masses can be traced back by considering the distribution of active or passive tracers. Treating the ocean as a conservative fluid fails in areas of significant turbulence activity such as the surface boundary layer. A surface mixed-layer is therefore coupled to the interior ocean in order to represent near-surface vertical mixing and to improve the response time-scales to atmospheric forcing which is controlled by the mixed-layer thickness. Since the model is designed for studies on large scales, a sea ice model with rheology is included and serves the purpose of de-coupling the ocean from extreme high-latitude winter conditions and promotes a realistic treatment of the salinity forcing due to melting or freezing sea ice. The experiments from which results are used here are the 1000-year unforced control simulation using the coupled ECHAM4/OPYC3 model and then two climate change simulations. The greenhouse gas only forced experiment (referred to as GGa1) used historical greenhouse gas forcing from 1860 to 1990 followed by a 1 per cent annum increase in radiative forcing from 1990 to 2099. The greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forced experiment (referred to as GSa1) used the GGa1 forcing, plus the negative forcing due to sulphate aerosols. This was represented by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading. The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. For 1860 to 1990 the historic sulphate aerosol forcing estimate was used and for 1990 to 2049 the aerosol forcing estimated for the IS92a emissions scenario. The GSa1 experiment did not extend beyond 2049. Fuller details of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 coupled model can befound at the DDC Yellow Pages.Several papers describe results using this version of the model - see Bacher et al. (1998), Oberhuber et al. (1998), Zhang et al. (1998). The climate sensitivity of ECHAM4 is about 2.6 degrees C.The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities.Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability, but the character of this world differs substantially. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity."

Previous research has shown that applying increased positive end-expiratory pressure by the use of expiratory valves in a face mask while awake, results in a reduction in AMS symptoms and higher oxyhemoglobin saturation. Therefore, in this research we aimed to compare sleeping oxyhemoglobin saturation and the incidence and severity of Acute Mountain Sickness in seven subjects sleeping for two consecutive nights at 3800m above sea level either using either non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, that delivered positive inspiratory and expiratory airway pressure via a face mask, or sleeping without assisted ventilation. The Lake Louise Score was used on both mornings, within an hour of waking, to assess the presence and severity of Acute Mountain Sickness. We found significant differences in the mean and minimum sleeping oxyhemoglobin saturation and the Lake Louise Score between subjects who used positive pressure ventilation during sleep and those who did not. We also found a significant difference between the mean sleeping SaO2 of those subjects who developed AMS and those who did not on the night spent without positive pressure ventilation. Key words: hypobaric hypoxia, acute mountain sickness, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, Lake Louise Score, sleeping oxyhemoglobin saturation."

One night at altitude was spent using a non-invasive positive pressure ventilator via face mask and one night was spent without ventilation. Ventilatory response testing for hypoxia and hypercapnia were performed at sea level i San Diego, CA. Morning and evening tests for end tidal carbon dioxide and oxyhemoglobin saturation were performed at WMRS. The Lake Louise Questionnaire was used to determine the presence and severity of Acute Mountain sickness in the morning, within an hour of sleep study termination."

KNB,EML,00528-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Data presented here are those collected from a survey of Ecology professors at 48 undergraduate institutions to assess the current state of data management education. The following files have been uploaded: Scripts(2): 1. DataCleaning_20120105.R is an R script for cleaning up data prior to analysis. This script removes spaces, substitutes text for codes, removed duplicate schools, and converts questions and answers from the survey into more simple parameter names, without any numbers, spaces, or symbols. This script is heavily annotated to assist the user of the file in understanding what is being done to the data files. The script produces the file cleandata_[date].Rdata, which is called in the file DataTrimming_20120105.R 2. DataTrimming_20120105.R is an R script for trimming extraneous variables not used in final analyses. Some variables are combined as needed and NAs (no answers) are removed. The file is heavily annotated. It produces trimdata_[date].Rdata, which was imported into Excel for summary statistics. Data files (3) 3. AdvancedSpreadsheet_20110526.csv is the output file from the SurveyMonkey online survey tool used for this project. It is a .csv sheet with the complete set of survey data, although some data (e.g., open-ended responses, institution names) are removed to prevent schools and/or instructors from being identifiable. This file is read into DataCleaning_20120105.R for cleaning and editing. 4. VariableRenaming_20110711.csv is called into the DataCleaning_20120105.R script to convert the questions and answers from the survey into simple parameter names, without any numbers, spaces, or symbols. 5. ParamTable.csv is a list of the parameter names used for analysis and the value codes. It can be used to understand outputs from the scripts above (cleandata_[date].Rdata and trimdata_[date].Rdata)."

First, the US News and World Report's 'Best Graduate Schools' website was used to identify the top ten Ecology and Evolutionary Biology graduate schools in the United States in 2010. Second, the website www.PhDs.org was used to collate a list of graduate schools in ecology with high National Research Council (NRC) Quality Measures. The NRC Quality Measure was set to priority five out of a possible five with all other priorities set to zero (not considered). Third, the same method as method two was used, except that the priority was set to five for Research Quality of the institution. And lastly, we obtained a list of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship recipients for 2006 to 2010 for the life sciences. We removed the following areas of study: biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, computational biology, developmental biology, genetics, immunology, molecular biology, neurosciences, and nutrition. The number of awards per institution were tallied and the Carnegie Classification system was used to determine whether schools were Research Universities (RU) or Baccalaureate/Arts and Sciences (BAS) institutions. BAS institutions with more than 4 awards were used in the survey. Based on these methods, a list of 51 target institutions were generated for the survey. Each institution's website was extensively searched to determine which course(s) were applicable for the survey. Fit was determined subjectively based on the course description, course requirements for ecology-related majors, and the academic department(s) housing the course. After the most appropriate course was identified, the department was contacted to verify that the course selected was appropriate for the survey. The person contacted was the department chair, the undergraduate course advisor, or a professor within the department. The survey consisted of 33 questions that fell into four categories: (1) basic course characteristics, such as class size, laboratory components, reading materials, and prerequisites; (2) the extent to which data management is covered and use of data in the course; (3) instructor opinion about the importance of data management education for undergraduates and perceived barriers to teaching topics related to data management; and (4) instructor characteristics, including year of PhD, percentage of time teaching versus conducting research, and data sharing practices. The survey was conducted online using Survey Monkey. Emails to instructors were sent out 29 March 2011 and the survey was closed 25 May 2011."

Each record (n greater than 30,000) of the main table includes the following fields: date; time; daily record sequence; group type; location (by 1 km grid square and since 2000 by GPS UTM coordinate); habitat type at beginning and end of observation; group size; number of bulls; quality of the count; bull age classes; presence of musth males; presence of estrous females; activity of group; ID of observer; quality of individual recognition of females and males. Linked tables include: individual IDs; family IDs; habitat types; activity types; observer IDs. Ancillary databases include demography (dates of births, deaths, cause of death); rainfall (since 1972); watertable (since 1984); 10 vegetation plots; behavioral postures; digital photo IDs; vocalizations. Since 2002 a GIS database (in ArcInfo) has been maintained incorporating ca. 100 geographical, geo-physical, hydrological, vegetation and elephant distribution layers."

KNB,EML,00533-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model, CGCM1, and its control climate are described by Flato et al. (1999). The atmospheric component of the model is essentially GCMII described by McFarlane et al. (1992). It is a spectral model with triangular truncation at wave number 32 (yielding a surface grid resolution of roughly 3.7 degrees x3.7 degrees ) and 10 vertical levels. The ocean component is based on the GFDL MOM1.1 code and has a resolution of approximately 1.8 degrees x1.8 degrees and 29 vertical levels. The model uses heat and water flux adjustments obtained from uncoupled ocean and atmosphere model runs (of 10 years and 4000 years duration respectively), followed by an `adaption' procedure in which the flux adjustment fields are modified by a 14 year integration of the coupled model. A multi-century control simulation with the coupled model has been performed using the present-day CO2 concentration to evaluate the stability of the coupled model's climate, and to compare the modelled climate and its variability to that observed. An ensemble of four transient climate change simulations has been performed and is described in Boer et al. (1999a; b). Three of these simulations use an effective greenhouse gas forcing change corresponding to that observed from 1850 to the present, and a forcing change corresponding to an increase of CO2 at a rate of 1% per year (compounded) thereafter until year 2100. The direct forcing effect of sulphate aerosols is also included by increasing the surface albedo (as in Reader and Boer, 1999) based on loadings from the sulphur cycle model of Langner and Rodhe (1991). The fourth simulation considers the effect of greenhouse gas forcing only. The change in climate predicted by a model clearly depends directly on this specification of greenhouse gas (and aerosol) forcing, and of course these are not well known. The prescription described above is similar to the IPCC 'business as usual' scenario, and using a standard scenario allows the results of this model to be compared to those of other modelling groups around the world. Some initial results from these simulations are presented below. The climate sensitivity of CGCM1 is about 3.5 degrees C.From the IPCC website: The B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R& continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00535-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Observations of the presence / absence of jellyfish (Catostylus mosaicus) were recorded during the routine Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program conducted by the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management. More than 200 estuarine and coastal sites are monitored monthly for water quality (including chlorophyll, nutrients, turbidity (secchi depth and NTU), salinity, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) within southeast Queensland. At each site the presence or absence of jellyfish was recorded. Sites where salinity <15ppt were removed from the data set as jellyfish are unlikely to occur in low salinity water."

KNB,EML,00539-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CThe A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 andB1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099, mean and monthly change fields."

KNB,EML,00540-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes aboveground macrophyte production (MAG; 1980-1989) data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP. Determination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).

KNB,EML,00540-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Aboveground Macrophyte Production data (1980-1989) methods Sampling for aboveground macrophyte production occurred once in late July or early August during the sampling season, as this is the period where standing emergents reach their maximum standing crop. The appearance of fully-grown Typha sp. was generally used to gauge if macrophytes had reached their maximum standing crop. Clip plot (MAGs) were one set of methods used to estimate aboveground production (van der Valk, 1989). Four randomly selected sample sites were determined on each of the 10 transects in all 12 cells each year, while respecting a 10m buffer zone around the perimeter of each cell, for a total of 480 clip quadrats. The sites were numbered consecutively from the northeast to the southwest corner of each cell. At each site, depending on species present, a 1 x 1 m (Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, or Scirpus spp.) or a ¼ x ¼ m (all other, smaller species) quadrat was used to clip the plots. Not all MAG sites from each cell were sampled at once; transects were grouped into pairs (1&2, 3&4, 5&6, 7&8, and 9&10) and then each transect pair from each cell was randomly assigned a number from 1-60 and then sampled in that order (van der Valk, 1989). At dry sites, all live and dead standing vegetation was clipped. All specimens of the five dominant emergent species (i.e. Scholochloa festucacea, Typha spp., Phragmites australis, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, and Carex atherodes; for the 1988 sampling year only, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani was added as a sixth dominant emergent) were separated. If there were other species present at the sites with greater than 25% cover, they as well were separated by species. Species present with cover of less than 25% were combined and labeled ‘minor species’. All five major species, any other dominant species (i.e. greater than 25% cover) and the ‘minor species’ group were also separated into live and dead fractions. From 1980-82, the % cover of each species present at the site was recorded in the field book. Burlap and paper bags were used to hold the samples and bring them back to the laboratory. Where there was water present, water depth was recorded starting in 1981. If submerged aquatic macrophytes were present, they were sampled by cutting along the edge of the quadrat and scooped into the sample bags. Filamentous algae was also sampled and separated from the other species present. The samples were dried to constant weight at 80 ºC and weighed. Select samples were then ground using a Wiley mill and then sent to the Freshwater Institute (1980-1984) or Iowa State University (1985-1989) for nutrient analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus (van der Valk 1989). Notes on reading the data: please note: -missing values (sample lost, equiptment malfunction, recording failure) in respective columns are represented by having two consecutive commas occur within the sample row. --For aboveground (i.e. clip plots, mag) macrophyte sampling, previously separate nutrient (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon concentrations) and sample vegetation data (i.e. water level, species code, live or dead, etc.) computer files were merged into one data file for archiving purposes. Nutrient data was associated to its respective sample vegetation data using the ground number. An artifact of this merging process, however, is there were cases where nutrient data did not have a corresponding match (i.e. by ground number) in sample vegetation data, or that the corresponding ground number to nutrient data had been lost. This has created nutrient ‘orphans’ (i.e. nutrient data with no corresponding information on sample vegetation) at the end of each sampling year in the data files. A potential source for this artifact is an error in the recording of ground numbers. However, the data was retained in the combined datafiles to increase the accuracy of a yearly cumulative nutrient estimation. References: van der Valk, A. 1989. Macrophyte production.

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

KNB,EML,00540-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Aboveground Macrophyte Production data (1980-1989) methods Sampling for aboveground macrophyte production occurred once in late July or early August during the sampling season, as this is the period where standing emergents reach their maximum standing crop. The appearance of fully-grown Typha sp. was generally used to gauge if macrophytes had reached their maximum standing crop. Clip plot (MAGs) were one set of methods used to estimate aboveground production (van der Valk, 1989). Four randomly selected sample sites were determined on each of the 10 transects in all 12 cells each year, while respecting a 10m buffer zone around the perimeter of each cell, for a total of 480 clip quadrats. The sites were numbered consecutively from the northeast to the southwest corner of each cell. At each site, depending on species present, a 1 x 1 m (Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, or Scirpus spp.) or a ¼ x ¼ m (all other, smaller species) quadrat was used to clip the plots. Not all MAG sites from each cell were sampled at once; transects were grouped into pairs (1&2, 3&4, 5&6, 7&8, and 9&10) and then each transect pair from each cell was randomly assigned a number from 1-60 and then sampled in that order (van der Valk, 1989). At dry sites, all live and dead standing vegetation was clipped. All specimens of the five dominant emergent species (i.e. Scholochloa festucacea, Typha spp., Phragmites australis, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, and Carex atherodes; for the 1988 sampling year only, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani was added as a sixth dominant emergent) were separated. If there were other species present at the sites with greater than 25% cover, they as well were separated by species. Species present with cover of less than 25% were combined and labeled ‘minor species’. All five major species, any other dominant species (i.e. greater than 25% cover) and the ‘minor species’ group were also separated into live and dead fractions. From 1980-82, the % cover of each species present at the site was recorded in the field book. Burlap and paper bags were used to hold the samples and bring them back to the laboratory. Where there was water present, water depth was recorded starting in 1981. If submerged aquatic macrophytes were present, they were sampled by cutting along the edge of the quadrat and scooped into the sample bags. Filamentous algae was also sampled and separated from the other species present. The samples were dried to constant weight at 80 ºC and weighed. Select samples were then ground using a Wiley mill and then sent to the Freshwater Institute (1980-1984) or Iowa State University (1985-1989) for nutrient analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus (van der Valk 1989). Notes on reading the data: please note: -missing values (sample lost, equiptment malfunction, recording failure) in respective columns are represented by having two consecutive commas occur within the sample row. --For aboveground (i.e. clip plots, mag) macrophyte sampling, previously separate nutrient (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon concentrations) and sample vegetation data (i.e. water level, species code, live or dead, etc.) computer files were merged into one data file for archiving purposes. Nutrient data was associated to its respective sample vegetation data using the ground number. An artifact of this merging process, however, is there were cases where nutrient data did not have a corresponding match (i.e. by ground number) in sample vegetation data, or that the corresponding ground number to nutrient data had been lost. This has created nutrient ‘orphans’ (i.e. nutrient data with no corresponding information on sample vegetation) at the end of each sampling year in the data files. A potential source for this artifact is an error in the recording of ground numbers. However, the data was retained in the combined datafiles to increase the accuracy of a yearly cumulative nutrient estimation. References: van der Valk, A. 1989. Macrophyte production.

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

KNB,EML,00541-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The file contains perennial grass basal cover and shrub foliar cover data collected for USFS Study FSRM 1706-12. A copy of the Study Plan may be downloaded from the web site. Measurements were taken on 20 randomly located permanent 100-ft. line transects in each of five pastures. The pastures had been grazed yearlong by cow-calf herds since 1915; utilization ranged from 47-60%. Two changes in grazing management were instituted at the start of the study period: 1) The utilization objective was lowered to 40%, and 2) Summer deferment (July-Sept) in alternate years began in 1958 in two pastures and in 1959 in the other two. Pasture 9 continued to be grazed yearlong and was measured in 1958 and 1963-1966 for comparative purposes. Data from pasture 9 were not included in published analyses. Mesquites (Prosopis velutina) in pastures 1 and 7 were killed with diesel oil between 1954 and 1957. Mesquites in pastures 8, 9, and 10 were left untreated. Cover was measured annually in late summer from 1957-1966 (except 1960) in units of 0.01 ft. Perennial grass was recorded as basal intercept; i.e., length of live root crown portion of tuft at ground level. Shrub cover was recorded as the entire live crown intercept excluding conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown. Taxa were recorded separately to the species level in most cases and sometimes to the genus level only. The OTHERPG code refers to unidentified perennial grass species; OTHSHRUB to unidentified shrub species. Sources of data were the original field data sheets except: Sources for pasture 1 in 1961-1966 were handwritten summaries that had been compiled from the field data sheets. A value of -9999 in a field means that no data were available because a reading was not made for that date."

Line transect data will be recorded on the regular Santa Rita line transect record form (page 12a [not included in digital file]). For each grass tuft or shrub intercepted, both the distance from 0 (zero) and the length of intercept will be record. In laying out permanent line transects the tape is placed against the right hand side of the stakes as the observer stands at the 0 (zero) end and looks toward the other end of the line. The 0 (zero) mark of the tape is placed at the 0 (zero) stake. The tape is then stretched as close as possible to the ground in a straight line from the 0 (zero) stake to the outer stake. On 100-ft lines it is helpful to put intermediate stakes at the 33- and 67-ft marks, or at 25, 50, and 75 feet to aid in re-establishing the line. Where intermediate stakes are used the tape is placed against the right hand side of all stakes. After the tape is pulled straight and fastened at both ends the vertical intercept of perennial vegetation is measured and recorded. In the following instructions the letter in parenthesis refers to a longhand letter on the attached sample 'line transect record'. Each item letter is followed in order by the item name as it appears on the form, then by underscored words indicating the kind of data to be entered and finally by the explanation of what is to be recorded and how. Data to be Recorded on the 'Line Transect Record' (Identification Data) (a) Study-title.--Enter brief title of study or project (b) Pasture-number.--Enter number of pasture in which transect is located. Plot 'number' or 'none'.--Enter number of plot on which transect occurs, or if there is no plot number involved enter the word 'none'. (d) Transect-number.--Enter number of transect. (e) Date-day-month-year.--Enter date of observation listing day first, month second, and year third. (f) By-initials.--Enter initials of observers. Record initials of observer first, recorder second. (Data on Perennial Grasses) (h) Intercept (.01 ft.)-lengths of intercepts.--Enter as a whole number length of each intercept in 0.01 ft. Each species is to be recorded separately opposite the proper symbol. Separate individual measurements by dashes. The intercept of perennial grasses is measured at the ground line. Only the live rooted portion of the tuft is measured. The smallest unit of measurement is 0.01 ft. (I) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total by species.--Record total intercept for each species. (j) Grass species-symbol.--Enter species symbol for any perennial grass that intercepts the line and whose symbol is not listed on the form. (k) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total all spp.--Compute and record total intercept of all perennial grasses. (Data on Shrubs) (m) Intercept (.01 ft.)-lengths of intercepts.--Record length (in .01 ft.) of live crown intercept as a whole number. Measure entire live crown intercept but do not include conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown. (n) Intercept (.01 ft.)-totals by spp.--Enter total intercept for each shrub species. (o) Shrubs-symbol.--Record symbols for species that are intercepted but not listed. (p) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total all spp.--Enter total intercept for all shrub species. Line transect data will be taken in 1957, 1958, and 1959, and in 1964, 1965, and 1966, preferable in late August or early September.

Treatments The major treatments affecting vegetation and livestock are mesquite control and grazing management. 1. Mesquite control.--The mesquite-control treatment will consist of killing all mesquite in pastures 1 and 7 with diesel oil but leaving the mesquite alone in pastures 8, 9, and 10. 2. Grazing management.--All pastures will be grazed on a flexible basis. Each pasture will be deferred during the growing season (July-Sept.) In alternate years. Cattle numbers will be adjusted each fall in accordance with the production of perennial grasses. The average utilization objective for perennial grasses will be 40 percent. Actual use may range from 30 to 50 percent."

Mesquite control.--The mesquite-control treatment will consist of killing all mesquite in pastures 1 and 7 with diesel oil but leaving the mesquite alone in pastures 8, 9, and 10. 2. Grazing management.--All pastures will be grazed on a flexible basis. Each pasture will be deferred during the growing season (July-Sept.) In alternate years. Cattle numbers will be adjusted each fall in accordance with the production of perennial grasses. The average utilization objective for perennial grasses will be 40 percent. Actual use may range from 30 to 50 percent."

KNB,EML,00546-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Three projects neared completion during 1980-8l: Steroid saponins, chemicals which are thought to elicit defensive behavior by many marine invertebrates, were isolated directly from seawater surrounding living specimens of two species of seastar, Pycnopodia helianthoides and Patiria miniata. The total amount of saponin released by equal wet weights of these two seastars is similar, but structural details of specific saponins may differ. Two other projects dealt with the defensive responses of certain prey to predators. One of these (with Marina Chiarappa) investigated the defensive responses of limpets to predatory flatworms. The other project was an investigation of the responses of two stenotopic limpets, Collisella instabilis and Notoacmea insessa, two seastar predators. In addition to the research described above revision of Between Pacific Tides has begun. Numerous photographs and collections will be taken at BML to support this work."

KNB,EML,00554-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The data originates from national monitoring on the effects of the Finnish agri-environment support scheme (MYTVAS). In 1999, 2000 and 2004, data on vascular plants was collected in 36 mesic semi-natural grasslands, representing different management types: 1) continuous seasonal cattle grazing, 2) cattle grazing resumed 3–8 years ago after over 10 years of abandonment, and 3) overgrowing, abandoned over 10 years ago. Each grassland was studied in 1999 or 2000 and the second time in 2004. The study sites were situated in southwestern Finland on mainly southwestern and southeastern slopes by small rivers and brooks on clay soil. All study sites were open grassland without trees and shrubs. The new and most of the old pastures were under the EU agri-environmental scheme of management of traditional rural biotopes. Coverages of vascular plants were estimated on 15 1 m2 plots randomly placed per study area.

KNB,EML,00555-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Project goals: The goal of this project is to establish a network of research plots in woody vegetation of Sonoma County, California (in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area). The objective of plot installation is to assess species distributions and community structure along abiotic gradients and to serve as a baseline for long-term studies of vegetation dynamics in response to climate change and other drivers. This field study is integrated with ongoing monitoring of weather and climate and was designed relative to downscaled projections of future climate and water balance and projected vegetation change through the end of the 21st century. Primary objectives: 1. To examine woodland vegetation community structure and species composition across fine-scale topographic and hydrologic gradients, providing a baseline for monitoring long-term change. 2. With additional focus on: - The effects of plot orientation to marine layer, aspect, topographic position - Distribution and possible hybridization between blue and Oregon oak, closely related species with overlapping geographic range at Pepperwood Preserve - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) succession and effects of removal for oak woodland management 3. To create an infrastructure for future projects studying ecology and species interactions in woody plant communities occurring on contrasting topographic and hydrologic gradients. Why this is important: Woodland and forest vegetation represents critical habitat in natural communities of the Bay Area, supporting a wide diversity of plant and animal species. A range of ecological processes can lead to vegetation change in these communities, including ecological succession, disease (e.g. sudden oak death), invasive species, changes in herbivore community, and wildfire. In the 21st century, rapid climate change is also expected to cause dramatic impacts on native plant communities. Climate will interact with the processes above, and may also cause direct impacts via drought, heat waves, etc. Detecting the impacts of climate change on vegetation requires long-term research, with quantitative baseline data and repeated resurveys. This projected established a network of permanent plots for longterm monitoring and demographic research on climate change and the interaction with other factors that may impact native vegetation. Project overview: Fifty 20 x 20 m plots were established across topographic and hydrologic gradients throughout the preserve. Within each plot all saplings (>50 cm tall) and trees (> 1 cm diameter at breast height) were permanently tagged, identified, mapped and measured. All seedlings (<10 cm tall) and juveniles (10-50 cm tall) were counted and identified. Micrometeorological monitoring was initiated, and will be expanded in the future. Project impact: This project supported the development and implementation of a woody vegetation monitoring and research study as a baseline for long-term study of vegetation change at Pepperwood Preserve, and a foundational model for future studies across the Bay Area. An outcome of the project is to apply results and lessons learned to vegetation management priorities of the Conservation Lands Network in the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of the outcomes will not be realized until we re-census the research plots (proposed 5 years re-census), while others can be developed immediately based on baseline data, such as the influence of topographical heterogeneity on community diversity at local scales.

KNB,EML,00556-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in this storyline from 'conservation' of nature to active'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

We reared red king larvae from both Juneau and Bristol Bay using identical conditions to determine if broodstock origin influences success of hatchery production. Larvae were collected from at least three females from each stock and mixed randomly. Larvae were stocked at densities of 50 larvae L-1 in eight 1200 L tanks at 10°C. Four tanks contained Bristol Bay larvae and four tanks contained Juneau larvae. All tanks were fed SFB Artemia enriched with DC DHA Selco (Inve Aquaculture). Survival to the first juvenile stage was 15%. There was no significant difference in survival to the glaucothoe stage between stocks."

KNB,EML,00561-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997). The central elements of the B1 future are a high level of environmental and social consciousness combined with a globally coherent approach to sustainable development. A strong welfare net prevents social exclusion on the basis of poverty. However, counter-currents may develop and in some places people may not conform to the main social and environmental intentions of the mainstream in this scenario family. Particular effort is devoted to increasing resource efficiency. Comprehensive incentive systems, combined with advances in international institutions, permit the rapid diffusion of cleaner technology. R and D to this end is also enhanced together with education and capacity building for clean and equitable development. Organizational measures are adopted to reduce material wastage, maximizing reuse and recycling. The combination of technical and organizational change yields high levels of material and energy saving as well as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity also improves as a byproduct of these efforts. Variants considered within the B1 family of scenarios include different rates of GDP growth and dematerialization (e.g., energy intensity declines). The demographic transition to low mortality and fertility occurs at the same rate as in A1 but for slightly different reasons, motivated partly by social and environmental concerns. Global population reaches nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with high levels of economic activity and significant and deliberate progress toward international and national income equality. Global income per capita in 2050 averages US$13,000; somewhat lower than in A1. A higher proportion of this income is spent on services rather than on material goods, and on quality rather than quantity, because of less emphasis on material goods and also higher resource prices. The B1 storyline sees a relatively smooth transition to alternative energy systems as conventional oil resources decline. There is extensive use of conventional and unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during the transition, but the major push is towards post fossil technologies driven in large part by environmental concerns. Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional effectiveness in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is high, as most potentially negative environmental aspects of rapid development are anticipated and dealt with effectively locally, nationally, and internationally. For example, transboundary air pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated in the long-term. Land-use is carefully managed to counteract the impacts of activities potentially damaging to the environment. Cities are compact and designed for public and non-motorized transport, with suburban developments tightly controlled. Strong incentives for low-input, low-impact agriculture along with maintenance of large areas of wilderness contribute to high food prices with much lower levels of meat consumption than those in A1. These proactive local and regional environmental measures and policies also lead to relatively low GHG emissions even in the absence of explicit interventions directed at mitigating climate change."

KNB,EML,00566-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.For the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a 'return to family values' in many regions. The A2 world 'consolidates' into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100. Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies. With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture. Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families."

KNB,EML,00569-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CThe A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in this storyline from 'conservation' of nature to active'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00573-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Low-Volume Filter Pack Air Chemistry Data Aerosol concentrations, HNO3 and SO2 were sampled using Teflon filter packs. Three 47- mm diameter filters were placed in each filter pack: a Teflon filter (1988-February 2004 Zefluor, 2 micron, Gelman Sciences, Inc.; February 2004-present Whatman, 1 micron) for collection of aerosols, a Nylasorb 1 micron nylon filter (Gelman Sciences, Inc.) for collection of HNO3 vapor and a potassium carbonate-coated cellulose filter for collection of SO2. The cellulose filters were Whatman 41, >20-25 Ã¯Â¿Â½m particle retention, coarse porosity, ASTM, 12 sec, (Whatman number 1441-047). The cellulose filters were cleaned before coating by rinsing and soaking overnight in double-deionized water. The three filters were placed in line so that the Teflon filter was exposed to incoming ambient air first, the nylon filter second and the carbonate filter last. The filter packs were placed in an inverted stainless steel pot (from 1988 - July 1993 it was an inverted plastic funnel) on a tower approximately 10 m above a mowed grass surface. A continuous flow of air was drawn through the filter pack at 3.00 lpm using a Gast, Inc. oil-less vacuum pump (model 1031, upgraded to model 1531-107B-6288 in 1998), which was regulated by a mass flow controller (Tylan General Inc., model FC280V, upgraded to model FC2604S in 1998 and to Aalborg model GFC 17 in September 2002). When the mass flow controller was off line for any reason, either a needle valve or another mass flow controller regulated flow. During this time, flow was measured using a rotameter (Gilmont Instruments, Inc., or SciencewareÃ¯Â¿Â½), and the flow measurements were corrected for instantaneous temperature and atmospheric pressure. Clean filter packs were exchanged for exposed ones every Tuesday. The Teflon filters were extracted in 50 ml of double deionized water for 24 hours in the dark at 2 degrees C after sonication for 15 minutes. The solution was then decanted into sample bottles and analyzed at the Cary Institute for pH, NO3-, SO4-2, NH4+, Cl-, Na+, Ca+2, Mg+2 and K+ for determination of aerosol chemistry. For analytical methods see http://www.caryarchive.org/empdata/metadata/Cary_Institute_Methods_of_Analysis_v2006.pdf. Nitric acid vapor was determined by extracting each nylon filter in 50 ml of a mixture of NaHCO3 (0.28 M) and Na2CO3 (0.22 M) diluted 1:100 with double deionized water. The filters were sonicated for 15 minutes and then refrigerated for 24 hours before decanting the solutions and analyzing them for NO3- and SO4-2. Sulfur dioxide was determined by extracting the carbonate-coated filters in 50 ml of double deionized water with 2 drops of hydrogen peroxide. The filters were sonicated and extracted as described above and the resulting solution was analyzed for SO4-2. Concentrations of SO4-2 from the nylon and carbonate filters were added to determine total SO2. After 1993 all sample extractions were preserved with 2 drops of chloroform. Using the total amount of time that each filter was exposed and the average flow rate for the week, weekly concentrations of each component were calculated. For samples that returned less than detection limit concentrations, one half the detection limit was used to calculate air concentrations. Deposition velocities were estimated using a multi-layer dry deposition model (Meyers, T.P., Finkelstein, P., Clarke, J., Ellestad, T.G., Sims, P.F. 1998. A multilayer model for inferring dry deposition using standard meteorological measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research 103: 22645-22661). Weekly average deposition velocities were combined with weekly concentrations to estimate weekly fluxes. Data sets include monthly mean air concentrations, monthly mean deposition velocities and monthly total deposition. For a descriptions of variables, see variable list with units below.

The JRGCE, initiated in 1998, includes 8 replicates of each of the 16 treatments. These are organized as a split-plot design with 32 circular plots, each divided into four 0.78m2 quadrants, separated by solid belowground and mesh aboveground partitions."

KNB,EML,00577-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The data originates from national monitoring on the effects of the Finnish agri-environment support scheme (MYTVAS). In 1999, 2000 and 2004, data on vascular plants was collected in 36 mesic semi-natural grasslands, representing different management types: 1) continuous seasonal cattle grazing, 2) cattle grazing resumed 3–8 years ago after over 10 years of abandonment, and 3) overgrowing, abandoned over 10 years ago. Each grassland was studied in 1999 or 2000 and the second time in 2004. The study sites were situated in southwestern Finland on mainly southwestern and southeastern slopes by small rivers and brooks on clay soil. All study sites were open grassland without trees and shrubs. The new and most of the old pastures were under the EU agri-environmental scheme of management of traditional rural biotopes. Coverages of vascular plants were estimated on 15 1 m2 plots randomly placed per study area. Additionally, in 1999, all plant species of the whole study area were recorded; in 2000 and 2004, coverages of plant species in the whole study area were estimated using a nine-class scale (1<0.125 %, 2=0.125-0.5 %, 3=0.5-2 %, 4=2-4 %, 5=4-8 %, 6=8-16 %, 7=16-32 %, 8=32-64 %, 9>64 %). The methods are described in the following publications: Pykälä, J. 2008. Perinnebiotooppien hoidon erityistuella aloitetun karjan laidunnuksen merkitys niittykasveille.

KNB,EML,00581-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes dead standing litter data (1985-1989), collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP. The high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). The MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies. The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, ‘clip quadrats’ of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989).

As the dead standing litter (1985-1989) data was never published, no reason can be given as to this change in methodology; however, the reduction in number of sites may have been to reduce the impact of sampling on the cells, or to reduce the workload. site number (1-220) h2o_depth water depth (cm) water depth was recorded at the centre of each quadrat. In addition to sampling month, water depth (i.e. dry vs. flooded) also determined the type of litter sampled (i.e. if dry = aerial standing litter, if flooded = aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, aerial standing flooded shoots) Note: Water depth data for Fall 1985 was only recorded on the fieldsheets as 'flooded', 'dry' or 'trace', and was therefore not included in the data file. centimeter real aerial_flood aerial or flooded 1=aerial (i.e. plants that are not toppled and, if at flooded sites, above the water surface) 2=flooded (i.e. plants that are not toppled and, if at flooded sites, completely submersed or laying on top of the water surface) whether aerial or flooded shoots were sampled was determined according to the sampling month. If sampled in May, only aerial standing litter (1) was collected from dry and flooded sites. If sampled in August, aerial and flooded shoots were collected at flooded sites, as well as aerial standing litter from dry sites.

KNB,EML,00581-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Dead standing litter study data (1985-1989) methods Definitions: -All standing litter: on dry sites, all litter that is not lying horizontal on the ground (from the previous August). -Aerial standing litter: dead plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which protrudes above the water surface (from the previous August). -Aerial standing live shoots: live plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which protrudes above the water surface. -Flooded standing live shoots: live plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which is completely submersed or laying on the water surface. The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, ‘clip quadrats’ of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Approximately 150 established research sites (15 sites per each of the 10 MERP cells) were utilized. The criteria for site selection was to represent the natural depth range for each species. New sites were selected when vegetation became sparse or void on previously selected sites. Each site was marked by a numbered stake. Sampling required that 1m x 1m quadrats be clipped at all sites. A randomly selected, undisturbed plot was located within 2 meters of the site marker stake. All clip data was recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. Month of sampling and quadrat moisture condition (dry vs. flooded) determined the incumbent sampling schedule (with the exception of 1985; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). At each dry site, only dead standing shoots within the quadrat were clipped. As with aboveground macrophyte sampling (contained within a separate data package on the KNB), large hand clippers were used, clipping all standing dead shoots rooted within the quadrat. The same general procedure was followed at flooded sites, with the exception that water depth was recorded at the center of each quadrat, and both aerial and flooded portions of a shoot, as well as live and dead (depending on sampling month), were collected and kept separately. For both dry and flooded sites, if a plant was rooted within the quadrat, all foliage was included with the sample even if it extended beyond the quadrat bounds. Within a quadrat, all dominant emergent species (i.e. Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Carex atherodes, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, Scirpus maritimus, Scolochloa festucacea; for 1985, dominant species also included Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium rubrum and Sonchus arvensis), and any additional species with greater than 25% cover, were treated separately. Other species with less than 25% cover were combined and labeled “minor species”. After clipping, these sorted plants were placed into separate paper bags and labeled by 1) species name, 2) collection date, 3) site number, 4) cell, 5) moisture condition along with clip type (i.e. dry standing litter, aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, flooded standing live shoots). Aerial standing litter (dead) was assumed to be from the previous year with the exception of Phragmites, which can persist for one or more years and therefore was separated as fresh litter (shiny; tan color) or old litter (dull; grey color; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). All litter samples were immediately dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius) in the drying room. If necessary, samples were stored in the cold room until space was available in the drying room. Once dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius), each sampled was placed in a paper bag and reweighed to 0.01g accuracy. Both weights were recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. All dried samples were ground in a 40-mesh Wiley mill and each stored in Whirlpak bags. A single sample which occupied more than one storage bag was subsampled at random from all storage bags, taking care to include plant parts in proportion to their relative biomass within the sample (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Clip quadrat samples were analyzed for nutrient (phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen) concentrations by Iowa State University. To reduce costs, only three samples from each species (Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Chenopodium rubrum, Sonchus arvensis, Cirsium arvense, Atriplex patula, Mentha arvensis, Hordeum jubatum, Salix sp., Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus maritimus, Scirpus validus, Carex atherodes) and litter type (aerial and dead samples for spring 1985, fall 1985 and spring 1986, as well as aerial and live, aerial and dead, flooded and live, and flooded and dead for fall 1986) combination were randomly selected for nutrient analysis, and only from the 1985-1986 sampling period.

Murkin, pp. 31-34. Manitoba, Canada: Delta Waterfowl Research Station. Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, ‘clip quadrats’ of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Approximately 150 established research sites (15 sites per each of the 10 MERP cells) were utilized. The criteria for site selection was to represent the natural depth range for each species. New sites were selected when vegetation became sparse or void on previously selected sites. Each site was marked by a numbered stake. Sampling required that 1m x 1m quadrats be clipped at all sites. A randomly selected, undisturbed plot was located within 2 meters of the site marker stake. All clip data was recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. Month of sampling and quadrat moisture condition (dry vs. flooded) determined the incumbent sampling schedule (with the exception of 1985; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). At each dry site, only dead standing shoots within the quadrat were clipped. As with aboveground macrophyte sampling (contained within a separate data package on the KNB), large hand clippers were used, clipping all standing dead shoots rooted within the quadrat. The same general procedure was followed at flooded sites, with the exception that water depth was recorded at the center of each quadrat, and both aerial and flooded portions of a shoot, as well as live and dead (depending on sampling month), were collected and kept separately. For both dry and flooded sites, if a plant was rooted within the quadrat, all foliage was included with the sample even if it extended beyond the quadrat bounds. Within a quadrat, all dominant emergent species (i.e. Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Carex atherodes, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, Scirpus maritimus, Scolochloa festucacea; for 1985, dominant species also included Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium rubrum and Sonchus arvensis), and any additional species with greater than 25% cover, were treated separately. Other species with less than 25% cover were combined and labeled “minor species”. After clipping, these sorted plants were placed into separate paper bags and labeled by 1) species name, 2) collection date, 3) site number, 4) cell, 5) moisture condition along with clip type (i.e. dry standing litter, aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, flooded standing live shoots). Aerial standing litter (dead) was assumed to be from the previous year with the exception of Phragmites, which can persist for one or more years and therefore was separated as fresh litter (shiny; tan color) or old litter (dull; grey color; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). All litter samples were immediately dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius) in the drying room. If necessary, samples were stored in the cold room until space was available in the drying room. Once dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius), each sampled was placed in a paper bag and reweighed to 0.01g accuracy. Both weights were recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. All dried samples were ground in a 40-mesh Wiley mill and each stored in Whirlpak bags. A single sample which occupied more than one storage bag was subsampled at random from all storage bags, taking care to include plant parts in proportion to their relative biomass within the sample (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Clip quadrat samples were analyzed for nutrient (phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen) concentrations by Iowa State University. To reduce costs, only three samples from each species (Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Chenopodium rubrum, Sonchus arvensis, Cirsium arvense, Atriplex patula, Mentha arvensis, Hordeum jubatum, Salix sp., Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus maritimus, Scirpus validus, Carex atherodes) and litter type (aerial and dead samples for spring 1985, fall 1985 and spring 1986, as well as aerial and live, aerial and dead, flooded and live, and flooded and dead for fall 1986) combination were randomly selected for nutrient analysis, and only from the 1985-1986 sampling period.

(1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

KNB,EML,00586-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFrom the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

Outplants were placed in plots established as part of an experiment established with the primary goal was to determine the mutual invasibility of native and exotic grasslands. Each experiment included plots that had an experimentally determined initial composition (exotic annual or native perennial) and included a single addition of perennial seed to annual communities and of annual seed to the perennial communities in the fall of 2000. Seeding rates were 1000 live seeds m-2 (average seed production of perennial grasses in our experiment). To establish exotic-annual communities, we killed perennial grasses with a short-lived herbicide (Roundup) one year prior to the seed-addition treatments. To ensure the establishment of a dense stand of exotics, we added all seeds collected from a nearby stand of exotic annuals of equal area to each annual plot. The most common species in the annual plots were Bromus hordeaceus, B. diandris, and Brassica nigra. The initial composition and seeding treatments were overlain with 4 g N m-2 yr-1 added as NH4NO3 (5 replicates for a total of 40 plots, 3 x 3 m)."

KNB,EML,00591-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Quantitative comparisons of distribution and abundance of exotic species in their native and non-native ranges represent a first step when studying invaders. However, this approach is rarely applied &#1113142; particularly to tree species. Using biogeo- graphical contrasts coupled with regional dispersal surveys, we assessed whether two exotic maple tree species, Acer negundo and Acer platanoides, can be classified as invasive in the non-native regions surveyed. We also examined the importance of biogeography in determining the degree of invasion by exotic species using this reciprocal approach. Local-scale surveys were conducted in a total of 34 forests to compare density, relative abundance, age structure of native and introduced populations, and whether the two introduced maple species negatively affected native tree species density. Regional-scale surveys of a total of 136 forests were then conducted to assess distribution in the introduced regions. Introduced popula- tions of A. negundo were denser than populations measured in their native range and negatively related to native tree species density. Age structure did not differ between regions for this species. At the regional scale, this species has invaded most of the riparian corridors sampled in France. Conversely, the density of A. platanoides introduced populations was similar to that of native populations and was not related to native tree species density. Although seedling recruitment was higher away than at home, this species has invaded only 9% of the forests sampled in southern Ontario, Canada. Although reported invasive, these two exotic maple species differed in their relative demographic parameters and regional spread. Acer negundo is currently invasive in southern France while A. platanoides is not aggressively invasive in southern Ontario. Importantly, this study effectively demonstrates that biogeography through structured contrasts provide a direct means to infer invasion of exotic species."

Two seasons were extensively in both regions. Every accessible forest was surveyed to estimate extent of invasion. Spatially-structured density surveys were conducted in both native and non-native ranges for each maple tree species. In total, 20 forests were surveyed in southern Ontario, Canada and 14 in southern France (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Table A1, A2). Within each forest, population densities were estimated not only for the introduced maple tree species but also for the native tree species occurring in the non-native range recipient communities. Acer negundo populations were sampled in 16 forests in Canada and 7 in France and Acer platanoides populations in 10 forests in Canada and 7 in France. All the population densities were estimated with the same T-square method, a plotless density estimator based on tree-to-nearest-tree measurements (Byth 1982). Specifically, introduced and native tree stem densities were assessed using 600 m transects with regular sampling at 3 m intervals. Both the distance from the transect to the nearest target tree species and the distance from that individual to its closest neighbour were recorded at each interval (Krebs 1999, Steinke and Hennenberg 2006). This distance-based sampling technique provides an accurate estimate of both density and degree of spatial aggregation (Steinke and Hennenberg 2006). Moreover, the life-stage of each stem sampled was also recorded as seedlings (&#1113143; 0.5 m in height), juveniles (&#1113144;0.5 m but &#1113143;3 m) or reproductively mature adults (&#1113144; 3 m)."

Moreover, the life-stage of each stem sampled was also recorded as seedlings (&#1113143; 0.5 m in height), juveniles (&#1113144;0.5 m but &#1113143;3 m) or reproductively mature adults (&#1113144; 3 m)."

KNB,EML,00592-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997). Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability, but the character of this world differs substantially. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity."

The Doi Inthanon forest is in a typical monsoon climate, and, thus, the lower elevations contain deciduous forest while the areas above 1,500 meters (areas often covered in clouds) contain evergreen forests. Situated at 1,700 meters, the Doi Inthanon FDP typifies the montane evergreen forest, and acts as the Asian equivalent to the montane La Planada site in Colombia.

KNB,EML,00599-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFor the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00602-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Habitat for birds and other animals is disappearing quickly from the Earth's surface. Conservationists are in a race against time to protect remaining habitat to stem the loss of biodiversity. Critical to these conservation efforts is focusing on-the-ground actions on the places where threatened species are found. To aid conservationists in determining where these species occur, NatureServe formed part of a consortium of conservation organizations that joined forces to develop a digital library of the distributions of the birds and mammals of the Western Hemisphere. The goal of the project was to make these maps easily accessible to conservation planners and other interested users. The data presented here represents an updated version of major product of this collaboration—a digital map library of the distributions of the birds of the Western Hemisphere, now covering 4,273 species. The maps are annotated to indicate sources, migratory status, historic versus current ranges, origin (native or introduced) and taxonomic decisions. The migratory status indications are particularly detailed, distinguishing where birds are permanent residents, breeding residents, non-breeding residents, or passage migrants. These maps are presented as a free resource for conservationists, researchers, and the general public. To view the map for each species, visit our InfoNatura website, search for the species you are interested in, and click on 'Range Map.' To download the map files in ArcView format, see below.

KNB,EML,00603-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFor the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

I hypothesize that restoration populations seeded with foreign genotypes will experience a greater breakdown in canalization, and, therefore, a greater increase in genetic variance than restoration populations seeded with local genotypes I will chose my study sites in accordance with the habitat matching model to avoid a significant decrease in fitness from populations planted in nearby restoration areas to those planted in faraway restoration sites. I will use Lupinus bicolor as my study species, because it is a popular restoration species in California, and its selfing nature will decrease the possibility of genetic contamination from nearby populations. To determine fecundity I will count all seeds produced by each plant. To calculate the genetic variance of the offspring generation I will measure physiological traits, and analyze them using a parent-offspring regression. To test my hypothesis, I will compare the difference in genetic variation between the control and each that population at each restoration site. If there is a greater increase in genetic variance between the control and the populations at the faraway restoration sites than between the control and the adjacent restoration site, my hypothesis that there is a greater breakdown of canalization in populations moved to foreign restoration sites in comparison with populations move to local restoration sites will be supported."

KNB,EML,00605-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Opportunistic and Targeted Herpetofaunal Surveys Reptiles and amphibians included in this dataset were collected by hand, seine, dip-net, lizard noose, submersible turtle trap, and by flip-and-replacement of natural and artificial cover objects. Sampling effort was focused on documenting taxa from as many localities on the reserves as possible. As such, for common species, localities with large numbers of conspecific study subjects were only lightly sampled, in favor of broader sampling of conspecifics at multiple locations. Pond- or stream-breeding amphibians were the exceptions: for these taxa large sample sizes were collected at every discrete breeding site we surveyed. Animals were obtained by searching any habitat deemed suitable for a species known or suspected to occur on the reserves. Surveys for terrestrial taxa generally involved walking through suitable habitat types, and searching for surface-active animals or animals present under cover objects. Surveys for aquatic taxa involved trapping (for turtles), or seining/dip-netting ponds. All species of herpetofauna known or suspected to occur at each reserve were targeted for inclusion in this dataset, with few exceptions. Surveys and sampling were conducted across all habitat types at each reserve. Taxa were targeted only when seasonal conditions were most conducive to maximal sampling efficiency. For example, plethodontid salamanders were targeted immediately after rainstorms, and whiptail lizards were targeted in the summer. Sampling at the reserves was fairly regular (roughly one survey per week, on average) at Stebbins Cold Canyon and Quail Ridge between late March and late July, 2012. Sampling was much less frequent at Jepson Prairie, since it hosts a comparatively depauperate herpetofaunal assemblage relative to the other two reserves. In the future, sampling at these three reserves will be more infrequent and opportunistic, with surveys initiated only to fill gaps in the existing dataset presented here. The goal of this projects sampling was to rapidly obtain tissue from 20 individuals, and sacrifice up to three voucher specimens, per species per reserve. For pond- or stream-breeding amphibians, these sampling numbers were increased to a per-breeding-site basis, rather than a per-reserve basis. The sampling protocols implemented to achieve this goal were not standardized or replicable. Estimating relative abundance or population sizes of herp taxa, or comparing the data to future surveys as part of a monitoring scheme, are not appropriate applications for this dataset. Instead, the dataset could be consulted as pilot information by researchers interested in answering those questions, to allow them to choose productive study sites."

KNB,EML,00608-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This investigation proceeded along two lines. First, individuals gathered data on 208 HCPs that had been approved by August 1997 in order to obtain basic descriptive information about plans. Second, the group conducted a more comprehensive analysis for a focal subset (43) of these plans. The HCPs in the focal subset range widely in geographic location, size, duration, methods, and approval dates. For this in-depth investigation, we developed two separate data questionnaires: one asked for information on theplans themselves, and the other focused on listed species and their treatment within HCPs. These questionnaires included information about what scientific data were available for use in formulating the HCP, how existing data were used, and the rigor of analysis used in each stage of the HCP process. As a whole, the questions were designed to generate a detailed profile of each HCP and to document the use (or lack thereof) of scientific data and tools. Plans were not judged overall; rather, questionnaires focused on different stages of the planning process, including the HCPs assessment of (1) the status of the species; (2) the take of species under the HCP; (3) the impact of the take on the species; (4) the mitigation for the anticipated take; and (5) the biological monitoring associated with the HCP. All of the data sheets, plan descriptions, and other detailed results from this effort are available on the NCEAS website: http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/projects/2049 . All descriptions of the data set contents are provided through the HCP report available at the web site above. In general the data sets contain responses to the questionaires from the HCP surveys. Each question is listed by question number in the data set and is described in detail in the HCP report (see web site). In addition, a listing of thecontents of the four final data sets is provided in the file hcp-load.lst."

KNB,EML,00610-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection routinely observed in California sea lions, but characterized by outbreaks (every four to five years) when large numbers of affected sea lions come ashore along the coast of California. Among those that are admitted to rehabilitation for this disease, mortality is quite high (~70%), suggesting that this disease may affect population numbers. A missing piece of information needed to understand the disease cycles in California sea lions is whether individuals can act as maintenance hosts for Leptospira, i.e. whether individual sea lions can become chronic carriers of the pathogen while exhibiting few or no signs of disease. Testing clinically healthy, wild-caught sea lions for this pathogen will help us determine prevalence of exposure as well as the prevalence of sea lions that are shedding the pathogen and potentially capable of infecting other sea lions. We propose to sample apparently healthy sea lions on Ano Nuevo Island and test their blood and urine for Leptospira. Maintenance hosts will be identified by the combination of an absence of clinical illness (normal serum chemistry), little to no antibody titer against Leptospira spp. (serology), and the concurrent shedding of viable leptospires in the urine (positive PCR or culture). These data will provide an important piece of information to aid in efforts to model the disease dynamics of Leptospira within the sea lion population and to understand the affect of this pathogen on the California sea lion population."

Both are sites of eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds located in Carteret County, NC, USA. Drum Shoals is located at least 250 m from the nearest Spartina marsh whereas Middle Marsh sites are located from 10 to 80 m from the nearest Spartina marsh and are almost surrounded by it. To denude plots, I removed sediment to a depth of 5 cm in 120 squares (0.25 m2 each) with a shovel in September 1975. I sampled plants and animals using a square box quadrat macrobenthic sampler (947 cm2 bottom area ? approximately 36.5 liter volume including the top 3 cm of sediment) having 0.8 mm mesh netting. Most of the sediment was removed through the mesh sides of the sampler in the field; after transfer to buckets, samples were brought back to the lab, washed again on a 0.8 mm mesh sieve to remove residual sediment, and frozen in plastic bags. All samples were taken in the day time within +/- 3 hours of low tide; water depth was 5 to 60 cm while sampling. Samples from denuded plots were taken in the center of each plot. Fauna were separated from shell material and plant material in a white tray. Animals were identified to species except for some polychaete families."

KNB,EML,00615-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model, CGCM1, and its control climate are described by Flato et al. (1999). The atmospheric component of the model is essentially GCMII described by McFarlane et al. (1992). It is a spectral model with triangular truncation at wave number 32 (yielding a surface grid resolution of roughly 3.7 degrees x3.7 degrees ) and 10 vertical levels. The ocean component is based on the GFDL MOM1.1 code and has a resolution of approximately 1.8 degrees x1.8 degrees and 29 vertical levels. The model uses heat and water flux adjustments obtained from uncoupled ocean and atmosphere model runs (of 10 years and 4000 years duration respectively), followed by an `adaption' procedure in which the flux adjustment fields are modified by a 14 year integration of the coupled model. A multi-century control simulation with the coupled model has been performed using the present-day CO2 concentration to evaluate the stability of the coupled model's climate, and to compare the modelled climate and its variability to that observed. An ensemble of four transient climate change simulations has been performed and is described in Boer et al. (1999a; b). Three of these simulations use an effective greenhouse gas forcing change corresponding to that observed from 1850 to the present, and a forcing change corresponding to an increase of CO2 at a rate of 1% per year (compounded) thereafter until year 2100. The direct forcing effect of sulphate aerosols is also included by increasing the surface albedo (as in Reader and Boer, 1999) based on loadings from the sulphur cycle model of Langner and Rodhe (1991). The fourth simulation considers the effect of greenhouse gas forcing only. The change in climate predicted by a model clearly depends directly on this specification of greenhouse gas (and aerosol) forcing, and of course these are not well known. The prescription described above is similar to the IPCC 'business as usual' scenario, and using a standard scenario allows the results of this model to be compared to those of other modelling groups around the world. Some initial results from these simulations are presented below. The climate sensitivity of CGCM1 is about 3.5 degrees C.From the IPCC website: The B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R& continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

Exclusion of this later stage has led, at best, to incomplete understanding of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics. This working group examined the wealth of litter and decomposition data that has been produced by several recent long-term field experiments. Our analysis will initially be based on data from LIDET (Long-term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team), a 27-site experiment conducted over a 10-year period."

KNB,EML,00618-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Each year, the Inyo County Water Department monitors vegetation conditions on the floor of the Owens Valley. The primary goal of this monitoring, according to the technical appendix to the Long-Term Water Agreement (Green Book) are to detect any significant decreases and changes in Owens Valley vegetation from conditions documented in 1984 to 1987. Vegetation live cover and species composition documented during the 1984-87 mapping effort were adopted as the baseline for comparison with each annual reinventory according to the Agreement. The reference measurements collected within individual areas mapped with similar vegetation (parcels) are referred to as baseline. The Green Book details certain decreases and changes in vegetation community types that must be avoided under the Agreement. Baseline vegetation communities in which evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation were classified as groundwater-dependent communities and are referred to as Types B, C, and D. These phreatophytic communities are dependent on shallow groundwater to maintain plant populations, as precipitation alone is inadequate to meet the water demand of these species. For these parcels, according to the Green Book, the goal is to manage groundwater pumping and surface water management practices so as to avoid causing significant decreases in live vegetation cover and to prevent a significant amount of vegetation from changing to a vegetation type that precedes it alphabetically (for example, Type C grass dominated meadow changing to type B shrub-dominated meadow). The goal is to manage the effect of pumping on the depth to groundwater to maintain baseline plant communities. A large proportion of groundwater-dependent parcels were mapped during baseline as Type C alkali meadows (61%), and the Agreement seeks to prevent these meadows from changing to shrub-dominated communities (Type B), a state change that is associated with increased depth to groundwater. Alkali meadows are of special concern because small increases in depth to groundwater can decouple the groundwater from the root zone of grass species..

My previous research has explored the evolution of aging and the physiology of life histories in garter snake populations characterized by 'fast-living' and 'slow-living' life-histories. Since a published account of the Santa Cruz Island gopher snake suggests that it exhibits dwarfism, it would be an ideal population in which to explore the role of the endocrine system in divergence in body size between mainland and island populations, as well as potential trade-offs with reproduction and/or lifespan. However, the first step in launching this potential research project would be to determine whether I can indeed find reasonable numbers of island gopher snakes, which I hear have been rarely sighted (though may be recovering due to the restoration efforts on the island). I would like to visit the island and search for snakes, to determine the feasibility of this project. Furthermore, should I find snakes, I will also be interested in exploring more basic aspects of their population biology, behavior, and habitat choice, with the hope of providing valuable information for their conservation and management."

These data will be used to address a series of research questions concerning subsistence and settlement patterns during the period between 6300 and 5300 years ago. The research results will relate to a larger-scale project at two coastal sites Im planning to undertake with extramural funding, and it would also serve as a basis for a future research project focused on occupation of the islands interior."

KNB,EML,00624-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Data on host use by parasites were obtained from 7 Canadian freshwater systems, either large lakes or rivers, in which most fish species have been surveyed for parasites. Only fish species for which at least 5 individuals have been examined per locality are included, because estimates of parasite infection level were inaccurate for smaller samples. All species of internal and external metazoan parasites were considered, which include the following groups: nematodes, acanthocephalans, cestodes, trematodes, monogeneans, leeches, copepods and branchiurans. When a species of internal worm occurred among sampled fish as both larval and adult forms, the two forms were treated as functionally distinct species; this convention is justified because larval and adult worms often have different modes of transmission, infect different fish species, and different organs within fish. This collection of data sets is part of the NCEAS hosted online Interaction Web Database at http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/interactionweb/index.html."

KNB,EML,00624-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Most webs are'bipartite webs', which consist of two groups that are assumed to interact with species in the other group but not with species in their own group (e.g., plants and insect herbivores). For each dataset, you will be presented with an'interaction matrix', in which columns represent one group (e.g., plants) and rows represent the other group (e.g., pollinators); you will be able to choose between text and MS Excel formats. Two types of data given for most datasets: prevalence, which describes the proportion of host individuals harboring a particular parasite species; and intensity of infection, which describes the average parasite load (number of individual parasites) per host individual. Prevalence and intensitydata are presented as two separate interaction matrices. In addition, all datasets include information on the host sample size (number of host individuals examined for parasites) and one (Cold Lake) also included an independent estimate of host abundance. Data on host use by parasites were obtained from 7 Canadian freshwater systems, either large lakes or rivers, in which most fish species have been surveyed for parasites. Only fish species for which at least 5 individuals have been examined per locality are included, because estimates of parasite infection level were inaccurate for smaller samples. When a species of internal worm occurred among sampled fish as both larval and adult forms, the two forms were treated as functionally distinct species; this convention is justified because larval and adult worms often have different modes of transmission, infect different fish species, and different organs within fish."

KNB,EML,00627-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Long-term NPP Field Sampling Protocol Study Sites and Methods: There are six locations: ridgetop (ridge), midslope (M-slope), swale, ESA (replicate 1, control block), Section 25 (SEC 25), and Owl Creek (OC). Make sure all are done. Each location has 15 plots. There are 3 transects with 5 plots in each transect. Plots in the grazed locations are protected by cages. Chose a random direction and distance to move the cages for the LTNPP harvest next year and re-stake the cages. Plots in the ungrazed locations are chosen randomly each year. The 3 transects are marked by rebar. Measure to the random location of the five plots along each transect. Equipment needed: Different size bags (sizes #2-shopping bags) and coin envelopes contained in a 5 gallon bucket Clippers Sharpie Knee pads m2 circular metal clipping frame Hammers Replacement tent stakes to restake cages Digital camera and digital camera field notebook (see protocol for taking digital pictures) Grinding and Combining Guidelines for LTER LTNPP 1. Check bag with sample for ID information, so that the corresponding plot may be found on the Biomass List for the LTNPP. 2. Once you have located the correct plot on the Biomass List, check to see if the plant species in the bag match up with those on the list. Keep in mind that the OPPO (cactus) has been removed from the main bag, so you will not find any OPPO in the sample bag. (If you do find any OPPO in the bag, please let Judy know.) 3. If you find any problems with the list not matching with the sampling bag, note the problem on the list and put the bag aside for Judy to deal with later. If everything matches up between the list and the bag, go ahead to step #4. 4. Separate the species for grinding according to this plan: a. OPPO (should already be separate) b. SPCO c. BOGR and BUDA d. All Others (All samples other than a, b, and c will be combined for grinding, and labeled OTHER.) All species will not be found on every plot, but separate the ones you do find according to this plan. Total weight of the sample to be ground needs to be at least 2 grams to be put through the Wiley Mill. Samples with a total weight of less than 2 grams will be ground in the ball mill-grinding step. 5. When preparing to grind a sample, first dump the sample out onto a tray or pan so that you can remove any foreign matter from the sample. Foreign matter may include rocks, insects, animal scat, other plant species, etc. Hopefully, most or all of the foreign matter will have been removed when the sample was weighed. 6. When you have finished checking the sample, go ahead and put it into the top of the grinder. It’s OK to bend or break the sample in order to make it fit. Always use the wooden dowel to push the sample into the grinder. Never use your hands to push the sample into the grinder! It’s a good idea to let the wooden dowel rest in the top of the grinding funnel, so that sample doesn’t “spit out” the top of the grinder after you turn the grinder on. 7. Before turning the grinder switch on, make sure that the grinder door is tightly closed and the glass “catching jar” is screwed securely onto the bottom of the grinder. Then you can secure the safety lock and turn the grinder on. 8. Quite often you will need to tamp down on the sample with the wooden dowel to force the sample to enter the grinding chamber. When the sample enters the grinding chamber the grinder will noisily chop it up. If the sample is too large or bulky, the blades may not rotate and you will not hear a grinding noise. This does not happen very often, but when it does occur it’s important to turn the grinder off right away so the motor doesn’t burn out. Then you can open up the door to the grinding chamber to free up the sample that is “stuck” with a sturdy pair of tweezers. 9. You can see the ground material coming out of the grinder into the catch jar at the bottom. When the flow of sample is down to a minimum, you can consider your sample ground and turn the grinder off. 10. Make sure to disengage the safety lock first thing, so that the grinder can not be accidentally restarted. 11. Now the grinding door may be opened and the small bits of remaining sample may be swept into the catch jar with a toothbrush. (Once again, please don’t use your hands!) 12. The ground sample may be placed in a labeled coin envelope and put aside for ball grinding in the future. If the sample is too large to fit in one coin envelope use as many coin envelopes as necessary. Label all of the envelopes as usual and then add 1 of 2, 2 of 2, etc. 13. The grinder and catching jar must be vacuumed out thoroughly between samples to prevent cross-contamination. Use a brush to turn the grinding blades and remove stuck sample if need be, not your hands. 14. Once the grinder is clean, you’re ready to start another bag of plant samples. A digital picture must be taken of every plot before it is clipped. Use the ¼ m2 black wood frame to show the perimeter of the plot. Label the white board with the same information used on the sample bags (shown below) and place to the side of the frame. Follow the protocol for taking digital pictures (U:field season\field studies\digital pictures). Clip at crown-level, except for shrubs. Only current year growth of shrubs are clipped that is green and has leaves, and which grows from an older, woodier branch. All live and recent dead material needs to be harvested from the plot – check your plot before moving to the next one. Old-dead is not included in the sample (the gray colored material). You can brush the old-dead material away from the clipped material with your fingers. Plots are clipped by species. It is usually easier to first clip species other than BOGR and BUDA. There are three cactus species on the site. Only current year growth of OPPO is clipped – these are the small pads. The two “barrel” cactus are not clipped (ECVI and COVI). There are only some times when combining of species may be done. You must follow these rules when combining species. 1) The only time combining is allowed is when two species are each less than a gram (this may be a seedling, a few leaves, or one very small stem or leaf of an individual). 2) Some species are never combined even if there is only a very small quantity – these are BOGR, BUDA, SPCO, and CAHE. 3) When combining never combine forbs with shrubs, grasses with forbs, etc. Only combine grasses with grasses, forbs with forbs, and shrubs with shrubs. Envelopes that contain combined species should have codes for all species in the envelope. Place all envelopes or small bags from each plot into the largest sample bag from that plot. Note all small mammal, ant and any other disturbances on the largest sample bag from that plot. This is usually, but not always, the BOGR bag. If there happens to be one or more large bags from one plot, keep track of them by labeling the bags “1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3”. Make sure that your writing is clear and legible and that the bags are labeled using a sharpie permanent marker. Wiley Mill, balance, and ball grinder Protocol for Capturing Digital Images for Aboveground Biomass Use the ladder to gain a bird?s eye view of the plot. Be sure that the wood or metal frame is delimiting the plot as accurately as possible. Run your finger along the edge of the frame and pull vegetation in that is rooted within the frame and out that is rooted outside of the frame. A photo may need to be taken of the vegetation underneath a cage. In this case, remove the stakes around the cage and place the middle frame under the cage in the center of the plot. Lift and rotate the cage one meter to the east and south and re-stake the cage. Situate yourself on the ladder in a stable position and as parallel to the plot as possible. Create a complete label for that project and plot on the white board. The label should be consistent and include the project name, date, transect, and plot or treatment description. Place the labeled white board to the right or left of the plot. Pictures should be captured at a 640 x 480 resolution. Review the picture on the screen to be sure that the image was captured. Keep track of the image # and plot label in the digital camera field book or on a data sheet that is provided. Place a pin flag with the plot and transect number or coordinates in the middle of the metal frame after you capture the image. This marks the center of the plot that was beneath a cage.

Equipment needed: Different size bags (sizes #2-shopping bags) and coin envelopes contained in a 5 gallon bucket Clippers Sharpie Knee pads m2 circular metal clipping frame Hammers Replacement tent stakes to restake cages Digital camera and digital camera field notebook (see protocol for taking digital pictures) Grinding and Combining Guidelines for LTER LTNPP 1. Check bag with sample for ID information, so that the corresponding plot may be found on the Biomass List for the LTNPP. 2. Once you have located the correct plot on the Biomass List, check to see if the plant species in the bag match up with those on the list. Keep in mind that the OPPO (cactus) has been removed from the main bag, so you will not find any OPPO in the sample bag. (If you do find any OPPO in the bag, please let Judy know.) 3. If you find any problems with the list not matching with the sampling bag, note the problem on the list and put the bag aside for Judy to deal with later. If everything matches up between the list and the bag, go ahead to step #4. 4. Separate the species for grinding according to this plan: a. OPPO (should already be separate) b. SPCO c. BOGR and BUDA d. All Others (All samples other than a, b, and c will be combined for grinding, and labeled OTHER.) All species will not be found on every plot, but separate the ones you do find according to this plan. Total weight of the sample to be ground needs to be at least 2 grams to be put through the Wiley Mill. Samples with a total weight of less than 2 grams will be ground in the ball mill-grinding step. 5. When preparing to grind a sample, first dump the sample out onto a tray or pan so that you can remove any foreign matter from the sample. Foreign matter may include rocks, insects, animal scat, other plant species, etc. Hopefully, most or all of the foreign matter will have been removed when the sample was weighed. 6. When you have finished checking the sample, go ahead and put it into the top of the grinder. It’s OK to bend or break the sample in order to make it fit. Always use the wooden dowel to push the sample into the grinder. Never use your hands to push the sample into the grinder! It’s a good idea to let the wooden dowel rest in the top of the grinding funnel, so that sample doesn’t “spit out” the top of the grinder after you turn the grinder on. 7. Before turning the grinder switch on, make sure that the grinder door is tightly closed and the glass “catching jar” is screwed securely onto the bottom of the grinder. Then you can secure the safety lock and turn the grinder on. 8. Quite often you will need to tamp down on the sample with the wooden dowel to force the sample to enter the grinding chamber. When the sample enters the grinding chamber the grinder will noisily chop it up. If the sample is too large or bulky, the blades may not rotate and you will not hear a grinding noise. This does not happen very often, but when it does occur it’s important to turn the grinder off right away so the motor doesn’t burn out. Then you can open up the door to the grinding chamber to free up the sample that is “stuck” with a sturdy pair of tweezers. 9. You can see the ground material coming out of the grinder into the catch jar at the bottom. When the flow of sample is down to a minimum, you can consider your sample ground and turn the grinder off. 10. Make sure to disengage the safety lock first thing, so that the grinder can not be accidentally restarted. 11. Now the grinding door may be opened and the small bits of remaining sample may be swept into the catch jar with a toothbrush. (Once again, please don’t use your hands!) 12. The ground sample may be placed in a labeled coin envelope and put aside for ball grinding in the future. If the sample is too large to fit in one coin envelope use as many coin envelopes as necessary. Label all of the envelopes as usual and then add 1 of 2, 2 of 2, etc. 13. The grinder and catching jar must be vacuumed out thoroughly between samples to prevent cross-contamination. Use a brush to turn the grinding blades and remove stuck sample if need be, not your hands. 14. Once the grinder is clean, you’re ready to start another bag of plant samples. A digital picture must be taken of every plot before it is clipped. Use the ¼ m2 black wood frame to show the perimeter of the plot. Label the white board with the same information used on the sample bags (shown below) and place to the side of the frame. Follow the protocol for taking digital pictures (U:field season\field studies\digital pictures). Clip at crown-level, except for shrubs. Only current year growth of shrubs are clipped that is green and has leaves, and which grows from an older, woodier branch. All live and recent dead material needs to be harvested from the plot – check your plot before moving to the next one. Old-dead is not included in the sample (the gray colored material). You can brush the old-dead material away from the clipped material with your fingers. Plots are clipped by species. It is usually easier to first clip species other than BOGR and BUDA. There are three cactus species on the site. Only current year growth of OPPO is clipped – these are the small pads. The two “barrel” cactus are not clipped (ECVI and COVI). There are only some times when combining of species may be done. You must follow these rules when combining species. 1) The only time combining is allowed is when two species are each less than a gram (this may be a seedling, a few leaves, or one very small stem or leaf of an individual). 2) Some species are never combined even if there is only a very small quantity – these are BOGR, BUDA, SPCO, and CAHE. 3) When combining never combine forbs with shrubs, grasses with forbs, etc. Only combine grasses with grasses, forbs with forbs, and shrubs with shrubs. Envelopes that contain combined species should have codes for all species in the envelope. Place all envelopes or small bags from each plot into the largest sample bag from that plot. Note all small mammal, ant and any other disturbances on the largest sample bag from that plot. This is usually, but not always, the BOGR bag. If there happens to be one or more large bags from one plot, keep track of them by labeling the bags “1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3”. Make sure that your writing is clear and legible and that the bags are labeled using a sharpie permanent marker. Wiley Mill, balance, and ball grinder Protocol for Capturing Digital Images for Aboveground Biomass Use the ladder to gain a bird?s eye view of the plot. Be sure that the wood or metal frame is delimiting the plot as accurately as possible. Run your finger along the edge of the frame and pull vegetation in that is rooted within the frame and out that is rooted outside of the frame. A photo may need to be taken of the vegetation underneath a cage. In this case, remove the stakes around the cage and place the middle frame under the cage in the center of the plot. Lift and rotate the cage one meter to the east and south and re-stake the cage. Situate yourself on the ladder in a stable position and as parallel to the plot as possible. Create a complete label for that project and plot on the white board. The label should be consistent and include the project name, date, transect, and plot or treatment description.

KNB,EML,00630-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00631-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"A major program undertaken by the Pollution Ecology Group during the year was VERTEX (Vertical Transport and Exchange), a multi-institutional project that is examining vertical transport processes in the ocean. Our laboratory is estimating the vertical fluxes in the water column of several synthetic organics and of a group of biogenic hydrocarbons. It was our original intent to include also petroleum-derived hydrocarbons, but levels appeared to be below detection limits. The initial cruise was undertaken on R/V WECOMA off Central California coast in August-September 1980. In preparation for Year II of the program, the group is assembling new extraction equipment which will greatly increase the extractable volumes of seawater, permitting measurements to be made of a greater variety of compounds at lower concentrations. Development of the seawater sampling capability for VERTEX and related programs has been accomplished through the use of the Research Vessel INVINCIBLE of the Bodega Bay Institute, which has provided a sampling platform for the development and use of the extraction equipment. The measurements of trace levels of organic pollutants in seawater, under conditions that minimize sample contamination, are being used to construct mass balance equations for these pollutants in coastal marine waters. Such equations are permitting assessment of the assimilative capacity of the oceans to absorb this materials. The VERTEX program is funded by the International Decade of Ocean Exploration Program, National Science Foundation. The group began a three-year study of the distribution of hydrocarbons in marine food chains dependent upon krill in the Antarctic, with three persons participating in a cruise of R/V HERO in the Antarctic Peninsula area in February 1981. In this program measurements are being made of the levels of hydrocarbons in seawater and at various levels of the food chain. Particular attention is being paid to the food chains dependent upon krill, since expected commercial exploitation of this abundant species might alter ecological balances within Antarctic food webs."

The Colony is comprised of 8 species in the order Ciconiiformes; Great Blue Heron (Area herodias), Reddish Egret (Egretta rufescens), Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Tricolored Heron (Egretta tricolor), Cattle Egret (Bubulcus ibis), Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Yellow-crowned Night Heron (Nyctanassa violacea), White Ibis (Eudocimus albus). The dataset contains the following variables with different levels of completeness depending on data collector and year. Date, Observer, Start Time, Stop Time, Tide start, Tide stop, Temperature, Barometric Pressure, Wind, Clouds, Species, number of individuals per section of the colony, and total number of individuals in colony."

All counts were conducted from Isla Alcatraz, landing in the cove on the southeast side of the island and hiking to various viewing locations or from the water to better count nest of the east side of the island (Figure 1). The colony was split into four sections based on natural vegetative and topographic breaks to ease counting. Monitoring sites were selected based on good viewing of at least one section of the colony, achieving complete colony coverage, and minimizing disturbance to ground-nesting Yellow-footed Gulls and later, Brown Pelicans. Counts were conducted using a spotting scope mounted on a high quality tripod, scanning up and down, across each section, in sequence from southeast to northwest and lasted 1-3 hours. Counts were made from a distance of 100 m following the recommendations of Rodgers and Smith (1995) to minimize disturbance to the nesting birds. For each species, in each section of the colony, the following information was recorded: total number of adults, number of adults on nests, number of nests with chicks, number of active nests. 1-4 hours each visit depending on what your goals for the day are. it takes about 2 hours to conduct a count. four sections were created to ease counting East, Central, West, and North.

KNB,EML,00643-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Predator-prey interactions often vary markedly across natural landscapes. One explanation for this variation is local genetic differentiation of prey traits due to selection from predators. Here, I evaluated the relative contributions of selection from a gape-limited predator (Ambystoma opacum) and spatial location within a larger landscape to explanations of variation in foraging, growth, and survival in 10 populations of temporary pond breeding salamander larvae (Ambystoma maculatum). In parameterized models, high gape-limited predation risk was predicted to select for intense foraging and rapid growth in larvae when migration rates were low (less than 5%). Under common garden conditions, salamander larvae from populations naturally exposed to constant predation risk from A. opacum foraged more actively than those from populations faced with lower predation risks. Higher foraging rates were associated with lower survival in populations exposed to free-ranging A. opacum predators. These results demonstrate for the first time that prey hunger can evolve in a natural landscape of variable gape-limited predation risk depending on natural selection for growth into a size refuge. Moreover, evidence suggests that foraging-predation risk tradeoffs can evolve over microgeographic scales. However, foraging rates also appear to have been affected by gene flow: prey individuals from populations with high predation risk foraged more actively if located within regions with similar predation threats. This interaction between local selection and spatial location suggests a joint role for adaptation and maladaptation in shaping species interactions across natural landscapes, a finding with implications for dynamics at the population, community, and metacommunity levels."

KNB,EML,00648-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The patterns and mechanisms of succession in clearings in mussel beds are being investigated with field experiments. Patches cleared in the dominant cover of mussels constitute the major source of heterogeneity in the distributions of species in the mid-intertidal zone. Three factors largely determine the patterns of succession which follow such local disturbances: the size of the clearing, the local abundances of adult plants whose spores can disperse into the clearing, and the abundance of grazers within the clearing. By experimentally creating patches of different sizes and then manipulating the densities of grazers, I have been able to demonstrate strong patch size-grazer interaction effects. These result in markedly different successional patterns in patches of different size. I am continuing to monitor these patches to see if the amount of recruitment to a patch is correlated to the abundances of adult plants surrounding it. If so, this will be some of the first solid evidence of the limited dispersal of spores by marine algae."

KNB,EML,00649-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00651-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997).The central elements of the B1 future are a high level of environmental and social consciousness combined with a globally coherent approach to sustainable development. A strong welfare net prevents social exclusion on the basis of poverty. However, counter-currents may develop and in some places people may not conform to the main social and environmental intentions of the mainstream in this scenario family. Particular effort is devoted to increasing resource efficiency. Comprehensive incentive systems, combined with advances in international institutions, permit the rapid diffusion of cleaner technology. R and D to this end is also enhanced together with education and capacity building for clean and equitable development. Organizational measures are adopted to reduce material wastage, maximizing reuse and recycling. The combination of technical and organizational change yields high levels of material and energy saving as well as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity also improves as a byproduct of these efforts. Variants considered within the B1 family of scenarios include different rates of GDP growth and dematerialization (e.g., energy intensity declines). The demographic transition to low mortality and fertility occurs at the same rate as in A1 but for slightly different reasons, motivated partly by social and environmental concerns. Global population reaches nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with high levels of economic activity and significant and deliberate progress toward international and national income equality. Global income per capita in 2050 averages US$13,000; somewhat lower than in A1. A higher proportion of this income is spent on services rather than on material goods, and on quality rather than quantity, because of less emphasis on material goods and also higher resource prices. The B1 storyline sees a relatively smooth transition to alternative energy systems as conventional oil resources decline. There is extensive use of conventional and unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during the transition, but the major push is towards post fossil technologies driven in large part by environmental concerns. Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional effectiveness in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is high, as most potentially negative environmental aspects of rapid development are anticipated and dealt with effectively locally, nationally, and internationally. For example, transboundary air pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated in the long-term. Land-use is carefully managed to counteract the impacts of activities potentially damaging to the environment. Cities are compact and designed for public and non-motorized transport, with suburban developments tightly controlled. Strong incentives for low-input, low-impact agriculture along with maintenance of large areas of wilderness contribute to high food prices with much lower levels of meat consumption than those in A1. These proactive local and regional environmental measures and policies also lead to relatively low GHG emissions even in the absence of explicit interventions directed at mitigating climate change."

Surveys were conducted annually from 1977 to 1996 using standard methods, but park coverage was complete only from 1980 to 1993. A finer regional breakdown of these data is also available, but contains some errors and omissions. There are supporting data on the age and sex structure of samples of these populations covering 1983-1996. Rainfall data are also available."

KNB,EML,00658-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In order to study controls on metabolic processes in soils, we determined the dynamics of 13CO2 production from two position-specific 13C-labeled pyruvate isotopologues in the presence and absence of glucose, succinate, pine, and legume leaf litter, and under anaerobic conditions. We observed that the C from the carboxyl group (C1) of pyruvate was lost as CO2 much faster than its other C atoms (C2,3). Addition of glucose, pine and legume leaf litter reduced the ratio between 13CO2 production from 1-13C pyruvate and 2,3-13C pyruvate (C1/C2,3 ratio), whereas anaerobic conditions increased this ratio. We interpret a low C1/C2,3 ratio as an indication of increased Krebs cycle activity in response to carbon inputs, while a higher ratio implies a reduced Krebs cycle activity in response to anaerobic conditions. Succinate, a gluconeogenic substrate, reduced 13CO2 production from pyruvate to near zero, likely reflecting increased carbohydrate biosynthesis from Krebs cycle intermediates. The difference in 13CO2 production rate from pyruvate isotopologues disappeared 4-5 days after pyruvate addition, indicating that C positions were scrambled by ongoing soil microbial transformations. This work demonstrates that metabolic tracers such as pyruvate can be used to determine qualitative aspects of C flux patterns through metabolic pathways of soil microbial communities. This is 1 of 4 related datasets for this study."

Soil moisture content was increased to field capacity. The soil was placed inside airtight Mason jars and kept overnight in the dark. Eighteen hours after incubation started, 10 ml of pure CO2 was added to the headspace and isotope composition of CO2 in each jar was determined after 30 min. The production of 13CO2 from pyruvate was calculated from the 13C content of CO2 in the 13C-labeled incubation corrected for 13C content of CO2 from control soil. Metabolic tracers were added 60 min later, as follows: two ml of a 3.2 mmol L-1 position-specific 13C-enriched sodium pyruvate solution was added to the surface of the soil. Isotope composition and concentration of CO2 were determined before and 10, 20, 40, 60, 120 and 240 min after pyruvate addition. At each time, 10 ml of headspace air was injected into a Tedlar air sample bag and diluted by CO2-free air. The isotope composition of CO2 was measured on a Picarro G1101-i CO2 cavity ring-down isotope spectroscope. Soil respiration rates were determined over 24 h on parallel incubations. CO2 concentration in the headspace was determined with a LICOR 6262. Picarro G1101-i CO2 cavity ring-down isotope spectroscope"

KNB,EML,00658-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Main Methods Soil was sieved (2 mm mesh), air-dried and kept in the dark until used. Soil moisture content was increased to field capacity. The soil was placed inside airtight Mason jars and kept overnight in the dark. Eighteen hours after incubation started, 10 ml of pure CO2 was added to the headspace and isotope composition of CO2 in each jar was determined after 30 min. The production of 13CO2 from pyruvate was calculated from the 13C content of CO2 in the 13C-labeled incubation corrected for 13C content of CO2 from control soil. Metabolic tracers were added 60 min later, as follows: two ml of a 3.2 mmol L-1 position-specific 13C-enriched sodium pyruvate solution was added to the surface of the soil. Isotope composition and concentration of CO2 were determined before and 10, 20, 40, 60, 120 and 240 min after pyruvate addition. At each time, 10 ml of headspace air was injected into a Tedlar air sample bag and diluted by CO2-free air. The isotope composition of CO2 was measured on a Picarro G1101-i CO2 cavity ring-down isotope spectroscope. Soil respiration rates were determined over 24 h on parallel incubations. CO2 concentration in the headspace was determined with a LICOR 6262. Picarro G1101-i CO2 cavity ring-down isotope spectroscope"

KNB,EML,00658-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Merriam-Powell Center for Environmental Research Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement This data policy document is based on the Long Term Environmental Research (LTER) Network data policy approved by the LTER Coordinating Committee April 6, 2005 Merriam-Powell Center for Environmental Research (MPCER) Data Access Policy The MPCER data policy includes three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of MPCER data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. MPCER Data Release Policy Data and information derived from publicly funded research, totally or partially from MPCER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with MPCER has been established, are made available online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. MPCER scientists should make every effort to release data in a timely fashion and with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data There are two data types: Type I â data are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement (see Section 3 below) within 2 years from collection and no later than the publication of the main findings from the dataset and, Type II - data are to be released to restricted audiences according to terms specified by the owners of the data. Type II data are considered to be exceptional and should be rare in occurrence. The justification for exceptions must be well documented and approved by the lead PI and MPCER Data Manager (Paul Heinrich). Some examples of Type II data restrictions may include: locations of rare or endangered species, data that are covered under prior licensing or copyright (e.g., SPOT satellite data), or covered by the Human Subjects Act. Researchers that make use of Type II Data may be subject to additional restrictions to protect any applicable commercial or confidentiality interests. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data in either Type I or II status, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Primary observations collected for core research activities directly supported by MPCER research must receive the highest priority for data release. Data collected by other sources to which MPCER supported research has added value is also a high priority Other types of data including non-MPCER data that was acquired for MPCER research, student thesis data, schoolyard MPCER data, or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available regardless of any restrictions on access to the data. 3. All metadata will follow MPCER recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. Whenever possible Federal Geographic Data Committee standard metadata will be used. MPCER Network Data Access Requirements The access to all MPCER data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized within MPCER to provide contractual exchange of data between Data Providers and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information â¢ Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement or Restricted Data Use Agreement, as applicable. â¢ A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data providers wishing to impose further requirements beyond these are encouraged to include them in their Restricted Data Use Agreements accompanying the datasets. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by MPCER will be accompanied with a use agreement that specifies the conditions for data use. For Type I data, this shall be the General Data Use Agreement (see appendix I). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. For Type II datasets, a Restricted Data Use Agreement must be provided with the dataset that identifies the specific restrictions on the use of the data and their justification. Because these are expected to be unique to the dataset, no template is provided although in most cases the General Data Use Agreement can be modified to serve. Grounds for restricting data may include the need to restrict access to species, habitats or cultural resources protected by legislation; rights of privacy granted by human subjects legislation; or protection of intellectual, financial or legal rights over the data held by a third party. This policy becomes effective when approved by the MPCER Executive Committee. It may be revised by, or at the request of, the same body. â Appendix I: General Data Use Agreement Definitions âData Setâ â Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. âData Userâ - individual to whom access has been granted to this Data Set, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Data Set âData Set Creatorâ - individual or institution that produced the Data Set âData Set Ownerâ â individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset.

The crater is within the Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument. The date of the eruptions that formed the 340-meter-high cone (1,120 ft) was initially derived from tree-ring dates, suggesting the eruption began between the growing seasons of A.D. 1064â1065.[4] However, more recent geologic and archaeological evidence places the eruption around A.D. 1085.[5] The largest vent of the eruption, Sunset Crater itself, was the source of the Bonito and Kana-a lava flows that extended about 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) NW and 9.6 kilometers (6 mi) NE, respectively. Additional vents along a 10-kilometer-long fissure (6.2 mi) extending SE produced small spatter ramparts and a 6.4-kilometer-long lava flow (4 mi) to the east. The Sunset Crater eruption produced a blanket of ash and lapilli covering an area of more than 2,100 square kilometers (810 sq mi) and forced the temporary abandonment of settlements of the local Sinagua people.[2] The volcano has partially revegetated, with pines and wildflowers.

KNB,EML,00659-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model, CGCM1, and its control climate are described by Flato et al. (1999). The atmospheric component of the model is essentially GCMII described by McFarlane et al. (1992). It is a spectral model with triangular truncation at wave number 32 (yielding a surface grid resolution of roughly 3.7 degrees x3.7 degrees) and 10 vertical levels. The ocean component is based on the GFDL MOM1.1 code and has a resolution of approximately 1.8 degrees x1.8 degrees and 29 vertical levels. The model uses heat and water flux adjustments obtained from uncoupled ocean and atmosphere model runs (of 10 years and 4000 years duration respectively), followed by an `adaption' procedure in which the flux adjustment fields are modified by a 14 year integration of the coupled model. A multi-century control simulation with the coupled model has been performed using the present-day CO2 concentration to evaluate the stability of the coupled model's climate, and to compare the modelled climate and its variability to that observed. An ensemble of four transient climate change simulations has been performed and is described in Boer et al. (1999a; b). Three of these simulations use an effective greenhouse gas forcing change corresponding to that observed from 1850 to the present, and a forcing change corresponding to an increase of CO2 at a rate of 1% per year (compounded) thereafter until year 2100. The direct forcing effect of sulphate aerosols is also included by increasing the surface albedo (as in Reader and Boer, 1999) based on loadings from the sulphur cycle model of Langner and Rodhe (1991). The fourth simulation considers the effect of greenhouse gas forcing only. The change in climate predicted by a model clearly depends directly on this specification of greenhouse gas (and aerosol) forcing, and of course these are not well known. The prescription described above is similar to the IPCC 'business as usual' scenario, and using a standard scenario allows the results of this model to be compared to those of other modelling groups around the world. Some initial results from these simulations are presented below. The climate sensitivity of CGCM1 is about 3.5 degrees C. For the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 andB1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099, mean and monthly change fields."

KNB,EML,00660-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1tI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00666-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.For the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a 'return to family values' in many regions. The A2 world 'consolidates' into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100. Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies. With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture. Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families."

KNB,EML,00670-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Low-Volume Filter Pack Air Chemistry Data Aerosol concentrations, HNO3 and SO2 were sampled using Teflon filter packs. Three 47- mm diameter filters were placed in each filter pack: a Teflon filter (1988-February 2004 Zefluor, 2 micron, Gelman Sciences, Inc.; February 2004-present Whatman, 1 micron) for collection of aerosols, a Nylasorb 1 micron nylon filter (Gelman Sciences, Inc.) for collection of HNO3 vapor and a potassium carbonate-coated cellulose filter for collection of SO2. The cellulose filters were Whatman 41, >20-25 Ã¯Â¿Â½m particle retention, coarse porosity, ASTM, 12 sec, (Whatman number 1441-047). The cellulose filters were cleaned before coating by rinsing and soaking overnight in double-deionized water. The three filters were placed in line so that the Teflon filter was exposed to incoming ambient air first, the nylon filter second and the carbonate filter last. The filter packs were placed in an inverted stainless steel pot (from 1988 - July 1993 it was an inverted plastic funnel) on a tower approximately 10 m above a mowed grass surface. A continuous flow of air was drawn through the filter pack at 3.00 lpm using a Gast, Inc. oil-less vacuum pump (model 1031, upgraded to model 1531-107B-6288 in 1998), which was regulated by a mass flow controller (Tylan General Inc., model FC280V, upgraded to model FC2604S in 1998 and to Aalborg model GFC 17 in September 2002). When the mass flow controller was off line for any reason, either a needle valve or another mass flow controller regulated flow. During this time, flow was measured using a rotameter (Gilmont Instruments, Inc., or SciencewareÃ¯Â¿Â½), and the flow measurements were corrected for instantaneous temperature and atmospheric pressure. Clean filter packs were exchanged for exposed ones every Tuesday. The Teflon filters were extracted in 50 ml of double deionized water for 24 hours in the dark at 2 degrees C after sonication for 15 minutes. The solution was then decanted into sample bottles and analyzed at the Cary Institute for pH, NO3-, SO4-2, NH4+, Cl-, Na+, Ca+2, Mg+2 and K+ for determination of aerosol chemistry. For analytical methods see http://www.caryarchive.org/empdata/metadata/Cary_Institute_Methods_of_Analysis_v2006.pdf. Nitric acid vapor was determined by extracting each nylon filter in 50 ml of a mixture of NaHCO3 (0.28 M) and Na2CO3 (0.22 M) diluted 1:100 with double deionized water. The filters were sonicated for 15 minutes and then refrigerated for 24 hours before decanting the solutions and analyzing them for NO3- and SO4-2. Sulfur dioxide was determined by extracting the carbonate-coated filters in 50 ml of double deionized water with 2 drops of hydrogen peroxide. The filters were sonicated and extracted as described above and the resulting solution was analyzed for SO4-2. Concentrations of SO4-2 from the nylon and carbonate filters were added to determine total SO2. After 1993 all sample extractions were preserved with 2 drops of chloroform. Using the total amount of time that each filter was exposed and the average flow rate for the week, weekly concentrations of each component were calculated. For samples that returned less than detection limit concentrations, one half the detection limit was used to calculate air concentrations. Deposition velocities were estimated using a multi-layer dry deposition model (Meyers, T.P., Finkelstein, P., Clarke, J., Ellestad, T.G., Sims, P.F. 1998. A multilayer model for inferring dry deposition using standard meteorological measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research 103: 22645-22661). Weekly average deposition velocities were combined with weekly concentrations to estimate weekly fluxes. Data sets include monthly mean air concentrations, monthly mean deposition velocities and monthly total deposition. For a descriptions of variables, see variable list with units below.

KNB,EML,00673-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model, CGCM1, and its control climate are described by Flato et al. (1999). The atmospheric component of the model is essentially GCMII described by McFarlane et al. (1992). It is a spectral model with triangular truncation at wave number 32 (yielding a surface grid resolution of roughly 3.7 degrees x3.7 degrees ) and 10 vertical levels. The ocean component is based on the GFDL MOM1.1 code and has a resolution of approximately 1.8 degrees x1.8 degrees and 29 vertical levels. The model uses heat and water flux adjustments obtained from uncoupled ocean and atmosphere model runs (of 10 years and 4000 years duration respectively), followed by an `adaption' procedure in which the flux adjustment fields are modified by a 14 year integration of the coupled model. A multi-century control simulation with the coupled model has been performed using the present-day CO2 concentration to evaluate the stability of the coupled model's climate, and to compare the modelled climate and its variability to that observed. An ensemble of four transient climate change simulations has been performed and is described in Boer et al. (1999a; b). Three of these simulations use an effective greenhouse gas forcing change corresponding to that observed from 1850 to the present, and a forcing change corresponding to an increase of CO2 at a rate of 1% per year (compounded) thereafter until year 2100. The direct forcing effect of sulphate aerosols is also included by increasing the surface albedo (as in Reader and Boer, 1999) based on loadings from the sulphur cycle model of Langner and Rodhe (1991). The fourth simulation considers the effect of greenhouse gas forcing only. The change in climate predicted by a model clearly depends directly on this specification of greenhouse gas (and aerosol) forcing, and of course these are not well known. The prescription described above is similar to the IPCC 'business as usual' scenario, and using a standard scenario allows the results of this model to be compared to those of other modelling groups around the world. Some initial results from these simulations are presented below. The climate sensitivity of CGCM1 is about 3.5 degrees C.From the IPCC website: The B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R& continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00675-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In many grasslands, aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is commonly estimated by measuring peak aboveground biomass. Estimates of belowground net primary productivity (BNPP), and consequently, total net primary productivity (NPP), are more difficult. We addressed one of the three main objectives of the Global Primary Productivity Data Initiative for grassland systems - to develop simple models or algorithms to estimate missing components of total system NPP. Any estimate of BNPP requires an accounting of total root biomass, the percentage of living biomass, and annual turnover of live roots. We derived a relationship using aboveground peak biomass and mean annual temperature as predictors of belowground biomass (r2 = 0.54; P=0.01). The percentage of live material was 0.6, based on published values. We used three different functions to describe root turnover: constant, a direct function of aboveground biomass, or as a positive exponential relationship with mean annual temperature. We tested the various models against a large database of global grassland NPP and the constant turnover and direct function models were approximately equally descriptive (r2 =0.31 and 0.37), while the exponential function had a stronger correlation with the measured values (r2=0.40) and had a better fit than the other two models at the productive end of the BNPP gradient. When applied to extensive data we assembled from two grassland sites with reliable estimates of total NPP, the direct function was most effective, especially at lower productivity sites. We provide some caveats for its use in systems that lie at the extremes of the grassland gradient and stress that there are large uncertainties associated with measured and modeled estimates of BNPP."

The purpose of these meetings was to develop methodologies for extrapolating sparse field observations of net primary production, including environmental controls on carbon allocation, and to create data sets representative of major worldwide vegetation and environmental regimes. The methodologies were then used to produce consistent data sets of worldwide NPP estimates, which were previously not available. The data sets were intended to be used by global change researchers to (1) parameterize and validate global primary production models, (2) calibrate models driven by remotely sensed data, and (3) re-examine worldwide patterns of NPP. The data sets include key ecological data such as biomass dynamics, climate and soils information, and NPP, providing a valuable global resource for a variety of other ecological studies such as biodiversity and nutrient cycling. This work was conducted as part of the Worldwide NPP Working Groups supported by the U.S. National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, a Center funded by NSF (Grant #DEB-94-21535), the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the State of California."

KNB,EML,00679-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"An extensive compilation of field data on net primary productivity (NPP) of natural and agricultural ecosystems worldwide was synthesized in the 1970s and early 1980s by Prof. H. Lieth, Dr. G. Esser and others. Much of this work was carried out at the University of Osnabrueck, Germany. More than 700 single point estimates of NPP or biomass were extracted from the scientific literature, each with a geographical reference (latitude/longitude). The literature cited dates from 1869 to 1982, with the majority of references from the 1960s and 1970s. Although this data set has not been updated since the 1980s, it represents a wealth of information for use in model development and validation. In the early 1970s, a subset of these NPP data was used by Lieth, Esser and co-workers to develop and test a series of statistical-correlative models of NPP as a function of mean annual temperature and precipitation. The later versions of these models included modifications for soil, seasonality, agriculture, and other human influences ('Osnabrück Biosphere Mode,''High Resolution Biosphere Model,' etc.). Most of the 720 unique NPP records (632, or 88 percent) have been matched to a bibliography of 356 references from the primary literature. The original form of this bibliography contained many more references than records, including multiple sources for the same author and study, as well as additional references to data on standing biomass, soils, and so forth. Since this is a useful resource in its own right, an edited and corrected compilation of these 858 references is available here with the cross-references to the NPP records highlighted. Of the 720 unique NPP records, about two-thirds have above-ground NPP estimates that range between 1 and 8530 g/m2/year (dry matter) -- or 2923 g/m2/year, excluding doubtful values, wetlands, and crops/pastures and other likely managed systems. Total NPP, for which more than half of the sites have estimates, ranges from 3 to 9320 g/m2/year (dry matter) -- or 3580 g/m2/year, excluding doubtful values, wetlands, and crops/pastures and other likely managed systems. Each record includes a site identifier, latitude, longitude, author, country, NPP estimates, vegetation type, and other variables. The vegetation-type field begins with a generalized biome type (including tundra, forest, Mediterranean, savanna, grassland, desert, wetland, and a number of managed vegetation types) and is followed by more specific vegetation terminology derived from the original data. Caution is advised in using these biome/vegetation types because they were not defined consistently within the original data set and nearly 200 sites lack any vegetation designation. To achieve completeness in a single synthesis file, a single NPP value (NPP_C) is included for each site that represents the sum of above-ground (ANPP) and below-ground (BNPP) components, expressed in grams of carbon per square meter per year (g C/m2/year). Where BNPP was not reported, it was assumed to be equal to ANPP. A ratio of 0.475 was used to convert dry biomass weight to carbon content. Total NPP was estimated as TNPP (where available), or as the sum of ANPP and BNPP (or from ANPP x 2, if BNPP was not estimated), and then converted to g C/m2/year."

KNB,EML,00679-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data acquisition: Several different versions of the Osnabruck data set were exchanged between Esser, Scurlock and Olson between 1988 and 1995. Starting with an October 1995 version and eliminating duplicates, these have been condensed into a list of 683 unique records by Scurlock and Olson. Most of these records (about 90 percent) were matched to a list of references from the primary literature. However, this bibliography contains more references than records, including multiple sources for the same author and study, as well as additional references to data on standing biomass, soils, and so forth. Since this is a useful resource in its own right, an edited and corrected compilation of these 856 references is provided here as an accompanying file. The NPP study sites represent primarily natural ecosystems; however, unusual sites, such as very young or very old forest stands, crops, fertilized pastures, and plantations are also included (and have been flagged where possible). The data set includes NPP data based on measurements collected over the past 100 years by investigators using a variety of methods and algorithms to estimate NPP. The scientific literature considered for inclusion in the data set was selected through a review of collections such as Biological Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts, Agricola, and Current Contents, as well as of a number of textbooks and monographs. Lieth, Esser and co-workers extracted data predominantly from primary publications, that is, those papers that described the original work. The minimum requirements for data to be considered were the following: 1) at least a vague geographical reference to the site of measurement (data related to vegetation types only were not considered) and 2) the use of one of the commonly accepted methods of assessing terrestrial NPP (Whittaker and Marks, 1975). Where the geographical coordinates of the experimental site were not included in the original paper, Lieth, Esser and co-workers selected the coordinates from maps or based them on site descriptions. Operational navigation charts (Defense Mapping Agency Aerospace Center, St. Louis Air Force Base, Missouri 63118, USA) and other regional and local maps were used for this purpose. QA/QC procedures: The quality assessment process performed recently on these data by Scurlock and Olson consisted of selecting those records for which consistent information was available on (1) NPP, (2) latitude/longitude (corresponding to known land masses), (3) biome or vegetation type, and, as far as possible, (4) at least one literature reference. The criteria for consistency included the use of common systems of names, units, and so on. Names of countries and other data categories were translated from a mixture of English and German to English only. By sorting and re-sorting the records in order of each variable, it was possible to check for out-of-range values and to cross-check many suspect records against the original primary literature (or at least against the titles of the primary literature references). In certain cases where the primary literature was readily available (e.g., Ecology, Journal of Ecology, Oecologia, etc.), data, vegetation type, and geographical coordinates were checked more thoroughly (see also below). Further duplicates or near-duplicates were eliminated at this stage. Sites were re-mapped using Geographical Information System software, and suspect sites that were located in oceans or other unlikely areas were identified. Suspect data were checked against original records and corrected in the data set where necessary. The bibliography of original-source references in the Appendix is provided as a separate file. The references can be linked to the site records by the Author combined with the Year; we have found that only the first four characters of Author are generally needed (the data file usually contains the name of the first author, whereas the file of source references contains the full list of authors). The list of 856 references has been edited by Scurlock and Olson for consistency of citation style, since it was originally compiled by a number of individuals using different forms of abbreviations. Journal and book titles were checked against citation indexes and major libraries and are given in full where available. Duplicates, errors, and spelling and typographical mistakes have been eliminated as far as possible, as have obvious mismatches between journal volume numbers and years. A number of missing references described in the original data set have been restored. Literature that is not directly cross-referenced to NPP records is marked with an asterisk (*)."

KNB,EML,00680-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Physaria congesta and Physaria obcordata are rare plants endemic to the Piceance Basin of northwestern Colorado, USA. Since the Federal listing of both species in 1990, management efforts have focused largely on protecting critical habitat. However, this unique habitat is also a prime energy development area, necessitating additional measures to protect and restore both species. The overall objective of my research is to determine the best approach for establishing new populations of P. congesta and P. obcordata in suitable but unoccupied habitats in the Piceance Basin. To address this objective I used 3 methods: a soil feedback experiment, a field ecological survey, and a field establishment experiment. In recent years it has been shown that relative abundance of some species is strongly correlated with plant soil feedbacks and rare species can demonstrate strong negative feedbacks with pathogens from their own root systems (Klironomos 2002). Based on this theory I conducted a 12-week soil feedback study using field soil as inoculum collected from occupied and unoccupied suitable sites. I found no significant differences in estimated biomass between occupied status of either species. To further investigate the differences between occupied and unoccupied sites I conducted a field ecological survey, building upon previous habitat suitability research, comparing plant cover, soil color, and soil/air temperature differential. I found significant differences between occupied and unoccupied sites for both species in multiple parameters (P. congesta = aspect, elevation, percent bare ground and rock, and soil color; P. obcordata = slope and soil color). Within occupied sites I found a negative correlation between P. congesta density and slope as well as a positive correlation between P. obcordata density with increased forb cover (< 5%) and decreased bare ground and rock cover (between 80 and 90%). The final phase of my research, which was delayed for a year due to legal issues, was to establish field plots, where I seeded and transplanted both species during fall 2014. Additional plants were transplanted during spring 2015. Initial germination and establishment rates, was collected spring 2015 where I found limited germination of seeded plots and moderate survival of fall transplants. Early trends show that P. obcordata is performing better than P. congesta and transplants are more successful than seeds. Within P. obcordata sites, far sites are performing better than near sites. Long term monitoring of these sites will expand our understanding of the restoration potential of these species. Results from this research will assist land managers to make informed decisions regarding future protection and restoration of these species."

KNB,EML,00682-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This is the appendix of the Ecol Apps tropical forest NPP paper 'NPP in tropical forests: an evaluation and synthesis of existing field data', and it is available online in the data journal Ecological Archives: Clark, D.A., S. Brown, D. Kicklighter, J. Chambers, J.R. Thomlinson, Jian Ni, and E.A. Holland. 2001. Appendix 1. Estimates from the literature of net primary productivity in tropical forests. Ecological Archives A011-006. Because of the difficulties of measuring NPP* components in tropical forests (see text), several approaches have been used to estimate NPP in these ecosystems. Although these approaches have attempted to make the best use of limited data on NPP* components, they often relied on relationships extrapolated from temperate forests, information from secondary forests, or dubious assumptions about the constancy of environmental conditions in tropical forests to develop estimates of annual NPP. Below we list estimates of total NPP, aboveground NPP (ANPP) and belowground NPP (BNPP) reported in the literature. Our objective is to highlight the problems associated with developing a consistent database of NPP in tropical forests. Most sites listed below do not meet the criteria established in this study due to problematic or undocumented methods. However, many of these NPP estimates have been used in past compilations of tropical forest NPP (e.g., Lieth 1975, Murphy 1975, DeAngelis et al. 1981, Vogt et al. 1996, Esser et al. 1997). Unfortunately, conflicting NPP estimates for a particular site among reviews of tropicalforest NPP has also added to confusion about NPP in these biomes. To clarify such cases, where possible we provide brief descriptions of how NPP was estimated in these studies. If necessary, we converted the units of the following NPP estimates from dry weight of biomass to carbon by multiplying dry biomass by 0.5 (Note: Raich et al. [1991] and McGuire et al. [1992] reported NPP in units of g C m-2 yr-1; however, both of these authors used a factor of 0.475 g C (g OM)-1 to convert dry weight of organic matter into grams of carbon)."

KNB,EML,00683-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997).The central elements of the B1 future are a high level of environmental and social consciousness combined with a globally coherent approach to sustainable development. A strong welfare net prevents social exclusion on the basis of poverty. However, counter-currents may develop and in some places people may not conform to the main social and environmental intentions of the mainstream in this scenario family. Particular effort is devoted to increasing resource efficiency. Comprehensive incentive systems, combined with advances in international institutions, permit the rapid diffusion of cleaner technology. R and D to this end is also enhanced together with education and capacity building for clean and equitable development. Organizational measures are adopted to reduce material wastage, maximizing reuse and recycling. The combination of technical and organizational change yields high levels of material and energy saving as well as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity also improves as a byproduct of these efforts. Variants considered within the B1 family of scenarios include different rates of GDP growth and dematerialization (e.g., energy intensity declines). The demographic transition to low mortality and fertility occurs at the same rate as in A1 but for slightly different reasons, motivated partly by social and environmental concerns. Global population reaches nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with high levels of economic activity and significant and deliberate progress toward international and national income equality. Global income per capita in 2050 averages US$13,000; somewhat lower than in A1. A higher proportion of this income is spent on services rather than on material goods, and on quality rather than quantity, because of less emphasis on material goods and also higher resource prices. The B1 storyline sees a relatively smooth transition to alternative energy systems as conventional oil resources decline. There is extensive use of conventional and unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during the transition, but the major push is towards post fossil technologies driven in large part by environmental concerns. Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional effectiveness in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is high, as most potentially negative environmental aspects of rapid development are anticipated and dealt with effectively locally, nationally, and internationally. For example, transboundary air pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated in the long-term. Land-use is carefully managed to counteract the impacts of activities potentially damaging to the environment. Cities are compact and designed for public and non-motorized transport, with suburban developments tightly controlled. Strong incentives for low-input, low-impact agriculture along with maintenance of large areas of wilderness contribute to high food prices with much lower levels of meat consumption than those in A1. These proactive local and regional environmental measures and policies also lead to relatively low GHG emissions even in the absence of explicit interventions directed at mitigating climate change."

KNB,EML,00686-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Tree measurements, composition of vegetation and fungi, soil humidity and humus layer thickness were studied in a 5.5 ha plot in forest, which was burned in 1997 at Kolari, Finnish Lapland. Measurements before and after fire were carried out in 1997, 1998 and 2004. Aim of this study was to explore how forest fire affects in forest composition. Study was carried out by the Finnish Forest Research Institute (FFRI)."

KNB,EML,00690-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in this storyline from 'conservation' of nature to active'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

When water is exported, fish become entrained into the diversion. Since 1957, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) has salvaged fish at the Tracy Fish Collection Facility (TFCF). The Department of Fish and Game's Fish Facilities Unit, in cooperation with DWR, began salvaging fish at the Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility (SDFPF) in 1968. The salvaged fish are trucked daily and released at several sites in the western Delta. The schedule of fish hauling is dependent on salvage rates, debris loading, and special-status-species procedures. Salvage of fish at both facilities is conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week at regular intervals. Sampling of entrained fish at the SDFPF and TFCF is the source for DFG's daily salvage and loss estimates for the monitoring of incidental take of listed fish species."

KNB,EML,00692-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The objective of this experiment was to look at bird dispersed seed movement in fragmented habitats and those connected by corridors. It was conducted in experimental landscapes that consist of five open habitat patches surrounded by a mature pine plantation matrix. There is one central patch surrounded by four peripheral patches. One peripheral patch is connected to the central patch by a corridor; the unconnected peripheral patches have either a rectangular or winged shape. Transplants and cuttings from bird dispersed species, Ilex vomitoria and Myrica cerifera, were placed in the central patches. Sixteen artificial perches with seed traps were placed in each peripheral patch. Fecal samples were collected from the traps weekly and analyzed for the presence of seeds from the central patch."

KNB,EML,00692-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Landscape Design The data was collected in 50-ha experimental landscape blocks. Each landscape includes five open habitats (patches) within mature longleaf and loblolly plantation forest. The patches were created by harvesting the overstory and are being managed for longleaf pine savanna. These patches include a central 100 X 100-m patch surrounded by four peripheral patches. One peripheral patch is 100 X 100-m and connected to the center patch by a 25 X 150-m corridor (referred to as the'connected patch'). The other peripheral patches are either a 100 X 137.5-m rectangular patch or a 100 X 100-m patch with two 25 X 75-m projections on opposite sides (referred to as a'winged patch'). All peripheral patch types are 150-m from the center patch. Seed Provision Methods In the central patch, cuttings of yaupon holly (Ilex Vomitoria; Aquifoliaceae) were wired to four rebar stations and arranged to look like real trees. Each of the cuttings was 2-3 meters tall with 1,500-5,000 fruits. Every two weeks during the period of 1 December 2000 to 15 February 2001, the cuttings were replaced with fresh ones. Additionally, three mature wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera; Myricaceae) bushes were placed in the central patch. The M. cerifera bushes were all female and were supplemented by wiring four to eight cuttings into the bush. These cuttings were replaced weekly. Since M. cerifera is abundant in the area, the M. cerifera fruits in the central patch were sprayed with a solution of fluorescent powder and Wilt-Pruf (Wilt-Pruf Products Essex, CT). A Nikon Optiphot 2 epifluorescent microscope with a FITC filter block and X20 objective lens was used to determine if the fecal samples contained florescent powder. Seed Collection Methods The seeds were collected from bird fecal samples that had fallen in seed traps located beneath artificial perches. The perches were 3-m tall PVC poles with a horizontal dowel 1.2-m from the ground. Each connected patch had 16 perches arranged on a four by four grid with six additional perches in a straight line down the center of the corridor. The winged patches had 16 poles on a four by four grid in the center of the patch; additionally, each winged projection had three perches spaced out along the center of the projection. The rectangle patches had perches arranged based on a four by six grid; perches were at every position on that grid except for the row of four farthest from the central patch, which only had perches in the center two columns. All poles were 25-m from all other poles and at least 12.5-m from the edge. Basket traps were positioned just below the top of the PVC. Seed traps (27 X 51 cm) with a 1-cm grid hardware cloth covering were positioned below the dowel elevated about 1-inch from the ground. Fecal samples were collected weekly from 1 December 2000 to 15 February 2001. A total of 3,805 fecal samples were collected. Labeling Descriptions The eight experimental blocks used are labeled as 8, 10, 53N, 53S, 54N, 54S, 75W and 75E. Within each of the experimental blocks, the patches are labeled with letters A to E. The central patch is labeled as A and the connected patch is labeled as B. Moving clockwise from patch B, the other peripheral patches are labeled as C, D, and E. Patches C, D, and E are randomly assigned to either winged or rectangular patch types. The winged patches are 8-C, 8-E, 10-D, 53N-C, 53N-E, 53S-C, 53S-E, 54N-D, 54S-D, 75E-D, 75E-E and 75W-D. The rectangular patches are 8-D, 10-C, 10-E, 53N-D, 53S-D, 54N-C, 54N-E, 54S-C, 54S-E, 75E-C, 75W-C and 75W-E.

KNB,EML,00693-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Subtle changes in ocean color signify various types and quantities of marine phytoplankton (microscopic marine plants), the knowledge of which has both scientific and practical applications. It became apparent to the oceanographic community that because of the dynamic nature of the world's oceans and climate, and the importance of the ocean's role in global change, a follow-on sensor to the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) should be flown. From a scientific perspective, obtaining ocean color data from space in the early 1990s is a high priority goal that has been recognized in reports of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The SeaWiFS Project was designated to develop and operate a research data system to gather, process, archive, and distribute data received from an ocean color sensor. The principal objective has been to acquire data that are critical for the study of the role of oceans, including the exchange of critical elements andgases between the atmosphere and ocean, and how these exchanges affect phytoplankton production.

Inherent in any space flight mission for scientific applications are Project elements that assure this success. The OV-2 satellite broadcasts SeaWiFS data in real time to the GSFC High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) station, as well as to other stations, and recorded data--Global Area Coverage (GAC) and Local Area Coverage (LAC)--to GSFC, WallopsFlight Facility (WFF), and ORBIMAGE. These HRPT, GAC, and LAC data are then transferred to the SeaWiFS Data Processing System (SDPS). The SDPS comprises a number of elements: namely, SeaWiFS data processing; calibration, validation, and data quality; data capture; and GSFC mission operations."

We used permanent 10m x 10m plots and marked all E. l. gnaphalifolium plants within each plot with flags and numbered metal tags and censused them annually in summer. One population was not burned during this time, three were burned once, and one each were burned three and four times. Plant survival and size measurements were taken annually. As plants can remain alive but dormant for several years, we continued to check the status of plants each year, even if it had not been seen recently."

We marked all E. l. gnaphalifolium plants within each plot with flags and numbered metal tags and censused them annually. A total of 1,114 plants were counted as alive at some point between 1989 and 1999. One population was not burned during this time, three were burned once, and one each were burned three and four times. These burns followed a schedule devised to benefit multiple species of concern at Archbold Biological Station, and the fire return intervals fell within the natural ranges for these habitats (Menges 1999). There were no recorded burns in these areas between 1927 and 1989. At each annual census, we monitored all plants for survival, total basal diameter (summed across all rosettes), and number of flowering scapes. If we did not find a plant adjacent to an old flag, the plant was recorded as dead, but we did not remove the flag and we checked the area surrounding the flag for scrub buckwheat plants in subsequent years. We searched each plot for new plants every year and every plant found was flagged, tagged, and followed in subsequent censuses. Study Sites In July of 1989, we began monitoring six populations of E. l. gnaphalifolium in four burn units at Archbold Biological Station, located on the Lake Wales Ridge in central Florida (27°11'N lat., 81°21'W long.). These populations occur in areas characterized as the turkey oak phase or the hickory phase of southern ridge sandhill (Abrahamson et al. 1984). Within each population, we established between four and fourteen permanent 10m x 10m plots.

As a part of setting up these experiments we established 136 plots which ranged in size from 9 to 25 square meters. These plots start out as either dominated by exotic annual or native perennial grasses. In addition to their initial composition, we subject these plots to a variety of treatments including seed additions, burning, nitrogen addition, watering, and pocket gopher exclusion. Data include annual sampling of plant cover (1 m2 pinframes), seed production and aboveground plant production (0.2 m2), as well as soil moisture and nutrient concentrations."

KNB,EML,00707-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes a litter bag study on shoot decomposition, collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP. The high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). The MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies.This short-term litter bag study was conducted to examine the decomposition of emergent macrophytes (Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus maritimus syn Schoenoplectus maritimus) that dominated during the first year of reflooding (1985; Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished).

KNB,EML,00707-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Shoot decomposition litter bag study data (1986-1988) methods This short-term litter bag study was conducted to examine the decomposition of emergent macrophytes (Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus maritimus syn Schoenoplectus maritimus) that dominated during the first year of reflooding (1985; Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished). Procedures followed in the 1986-1988 Shoot Decomposition Study were the same as those described for the 1985-1987 ‘Decomposition of Mud-flat Species’ litterbag study (stored in a separate data package on the KNB). Dead above-water shoots of each of the five emergent macrophytes were collected on 23 April 1986. A subsample of each species was retained as a control for nutrient analysis. A second subsample of material was oven dried at 80 degrees Celcius and used to estimate the initial oven-dry weight of each bag (note that this data is not included in the data file; see the fresh_wt metadata for the fresh to oven dry weight conversion factor). One hundred and fifty litter bags were made for each species. Thirty litter bag sites were selected for each species, three in each of the 10 marshes. Sites were selected to span the range of elevations in which each species was observed during 1985, and the same litter bag sites were used as in the 1985-1987 study (a yellow ribbon on each site marker post separated litter bags from the 1985-1987 and 1986-1988 studies). In addition, thirty new sites will be established at locations selected to range across elevations over which each species was observed growing during 1985. For each species, sites were within stands of the same species. Five litter bags for each species were deployed at each sampling site on 26 May – 3 June 1986. Bags were retrieved 28 May – 5 June (48 hours), 14 – 18 July (49 days), 20 – 21 July 1987 (418 days) and 30 – 31 May 1988 (730 days) (note that although five litter bags were deployed per site, there were only four collection dates; therefore, on the final collection date, often two litter bags were collected. As this study was never published, no reason can be given as to why this change in methodology was made and therefore, the data should be used with caution). Water depth was recorded at the time of litter bag collection (Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished). Lab methods followed that conducted for the 1985-1987 litter bag study. Similar to the 1985-1987 ‘Decomposition of Mud-flat Species’ litterbag study, to reduce the number of samples that were analyzed for nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, ground litter samples were pooled by species, water depth and collection date. Water depths were stratified into 30 cm intervals, i.e. 0 cm = unflooded, 1-30 cm = shallow, 31-60 cm = medium and >60 cm = deep. The percent dry weight, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon remaining could be calculated for each bag based on values from the initial control samples (Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished). Notes on reading the data: -Entries left blank in columns between 2 commas represent that the sample was not able to be taken and/or recorded properly and is considered 'lost' information (e.g. where there is no lb_num and therefore no fresh_wt for a particular litterbag), or, where cell=0, all other columns are blank, except for nutrients, because this represents a control litter bag. -Zeros used as values represent that a particular parameter was measured (e.g. water depth) and the value was zero, or as a categorical variable (i.e. for cell_num, 0=control) References: Nelson, J.W. 1988.

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

KNB,EML,00707-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Shoot decomposition litter bag study data (1986-1988) methods This short-term litter bag study was conducted to examine the decomposition of emergent macrophytes (Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus lacustris and Scirpus maritimus syn Schoenoplectus maritimus) that dominated during the first year of reflooding (1985; Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished). Procedures followed in the 1986-1988 Shoot Decomposition Study were the same as those described for the 1985-1987 ‘Decomposition of Mud-flat Species’ litterbag study (stored in a separate data package on the KNB). Dead above-water shoots of each of the five emergent macrophytes were collected on 23 April 1986. A subsample of each species was retained as a control for nutrient analysis. A second subsample of material was oven dried at 80 degrees Celcius and used to estimate the initial oven-dry weight of each bag (note that this data is not included in the data file; see the fresh_wt metadata for the fresh to oven dry weight conversion factor). One hundred and fifty litter bags were made for each species. Thirty litter bag sites were selected for each species, three in each of the 10 marshes. Sites were selected to span the range of elevations in which each species was observed during 1985, and the same litter bag sites were used as in the 1985-1987 study (a yellow ribbon on each site marker post separated litter bags from the 1985-1987 and 1986-1988 studies). In addition, thirty new sites will be established at locations selected to range across elevations over which each species was observed growing during 1985. For each species, sites were within stands of the same species. Five litter bags for each species were deployed at each sampling site on 26 May – 3 June 1986. Bags were retrieved 28 May – 5 June (48 hours), 14 – 18 July (49 days), 20 – 21 July 1987 (418 days) and 30 – 31 May 1988 (730 days) (note that although five litter bags were deployed per site, there were only four collection dates; therefore, on the final collection date, often two litter bags were collected. As this study was never published, no reason can be given as to why this change in methodology was made and therefore, the data should be used with caution). Water depth was recorded at the time of litter bag collection (Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished). Lab methods followed that conducted for the 1985-1987 litter bag study. Similar to the 1985-1987 ‘Decomposition of Mud-flat Species’ litterbag study, to reduce the number of samples that were analyzed for nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon, ground litter samples were pooled by species, water depth and collection date. Water depths were stratified into 30 cm intervals, i.e. 0 cm = unflooded, 1-30 cm = shallow, 31-60 cm = medium and >60 cm = deep. The percent dry weight, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon remaining could be calculated for each bag based on values from the initial control samples (Nelson, 1988; Wrubleski, Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, unpublished). Notes on reading the data: -Entries left blank in columns between 2 commas represent that the sample was not able to be taken and/or recorded properly and is considered 'lost' information (e.g. where there is no lb_num and therefore no fresh_wt for a particular litterbag), or, where cell=0, all other columns are blank, except for nutrients, because this represents a control litter bag. -Zeros used as values represent that a particular parameter was measured (e.g. water depth) and the value was zero, or as a categorical variable (i.e. for cell_num, 0=control) References: Nelson, J.W. 1988.

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

KNB,EML,00711-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFor the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00717-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes soil nutrient and site vegetation characetization data for all groundwater well sites. The main objective for monitoring soil nutrients in the MERP was to quantify sediments as a nutrient pool in wetlands and to characterize the sediments of the MERP cells over time. Along with monitoring the other major nutrient pools (surface water, plants and plant litter, animals and interstitial waters), yearly changes in the sediment nutrient pool can provide important information on the nutrient cycling within wetlands. In addition, the effects of deep flooding and drawdown on nutrients in marsh sediments was also evaluated (Kadlec, 1985a; Kadlec, 1985b; Kaldec, 1989).

KNB,EML,00717-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Soil nutrients and groundwater well site characterization data (1980-1985) methods Soil samples were collected on an annual basis for nutrient analysis, during the last week of June or early July (with the exception of 1984, when samples were collected in August and October). Soil samples were collected at five groundwater well sites per cell (in all cells except 9, where samples were collected from the 10 groundwater (GW) well sites), using the invertebrate core sampler (5 cm inner diameter, 20 cm length; Kadlec, 1985a). Enough cores were taken to completely fill a wide-mouth Mason jar, which was labeled with the date, and groundwater well number. All soil nutrient samples were sent to the Provincial Soil Testing Lab at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada), to determine total nitrogen, available nitrogen, total phosphorous, available phosphorous, total sulpher, available potassium, sediment water content (as a percent of the soil dry weight) and percent organic matter (added in 1983). A master sheet with sample numbers 1-65 was used to keep track of each sample. As per requirements of the Soil Testing Lab, each wet sediment sample was homogenized in a blender before being transferred the sample boxes provided by the Soil Testing Lab, and stored in a freezer (Kadlec, 1985a). All anaylses were performed on wet samples. The analytic procedure was modified so that subsamples for analyses of available N (NO3--N + NO2-N), available P (dissolved and some adsorbed P), and available K were not dried prior to extraction, as drying affects extractable quantities of most ions in organic soils (Kadlec, 1989; Anderson and Beverly, 1985; Gilliam and Richter, 1985). N and P subsamples were extracted with 0.5M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 and K subsamples with 1N NH4OAc at pH 7. The N and P extracts were analyzed on a Technicon Auto Analyzer, N by a modification of the procedure of Kampshake et al. (1967) and P by the ascorbic acid-ammonium molybdate method (Page et al., 1982). K was analyzed by flame photometry. Analyses for total P and total S were performed on dried sediment samples which were digested with HNO3 and HClO4. Total N was determined by the Kjeldahl method. Organic matter was determined by the potassium dichromate reduction procedure (Page et al., 1982). In addition to the Manitoba Provincial Soil Testing Laboratory measured sediment water content, at the field laboratory, separate known volume cores, taken at the same time as the cores for nutrient analysis, were analyzed for dry weight and water per unit volume. However, this data was not able to be archived. Because of the range in sediment consistency in the marshes, Kaldec (1989) was also not confident that the coring technique provided accurate data for bulk density calculations. Nevertheless, it was the best available procedure for largescale routine use at the time. Sampling for the characterization of macrophytes at groundwater well sites occurred once in late July or early August during the sampling season, as this is the period where standing emergents reach their maximum standing crop. The groundwater well sites were examined for plant species present, density or percent cover, and live or dead plants. To characterize the sites, a square meter quadrat was randomly placed within a 2 metre radius of the well site. Within the quadrat, the number of stems of emergent or upland species were counted. For submergent species, a percent cover value in the total quadrat area was estimated. Macrophytes were coded to species when possible. For the 1982 sampling year only, surveys also recorded if the species was live or dead. Notes on reading the data: -Note that, for 1982 soil nutrient analyses, TN, TP and TS at all marsh sites (including the control cells 11 &12) decreased significantly, as compared to soil nutrient values for all other years. No explanation related to the experiment could be provided from the Kadlec (1989) publication, as well as from consultation with soil nutrient experts, for this anomalous data. As QA/QC data were not available for the Manitoba Provincial Soil Testing Laboratory reports for 1982, the possibility of an error related to laboratory analyses should not be overlooked. Therefore, the 1982 soil nutrient data should be treated with caution. -For nutrient analyses on soil samples, zero values indicate that a particular parameter was measured and its’ value was zero. -For nutrient analyses on soil samples, blanks for a particular parameter indicate that an insufficient amount of sample was available to run a particular analysis, that a sample was not able to be taken/recorded properly and that information is considered to be lost, or that a particular parameter was not recorded in that sampling year (i.e. percent organic matter for 1980-1982). -For 1982 soil nutrient analyses, TN, TP and TS at all marsh sites (including the control cells 11 &12) decreased significantly, as compared to soil nutrient values for all other years. No explanation could be provided in the Kadlec (1989) publication, as well as from consultation with soil nutrient experts, for this anomalous data. As QA/QC data were not available for the Manitoba Provincial Soil Testing Laboratory reports for 1982, the possibility of an error related to laboratory analyses should not be overlooked. Therefore, the 1982 soil nutrient data should be treated with caution. -For vegetation data on groundwater well site characterizations, zero values for both quadrat density/percent cover value and species indicates that there was no vegetation at that particular groundwater well site. -For vegetation data on groundwater well site characterizations, a blank entry indicates: -where a particular parameter was not recorded for that sampling year (i.e. ‘live or dead’ in all sampling years but 1982), or -that a sample was not able to be taken/recorded properly at that groundwater well site and that the information is considered to be lost, or -a total for all other (unknown or minor) ‘live’ or ‘dead’ species, where the ‘plant species present’ parameter is blank, but a value for ‘live or dead’ and ‘density or cover value’ is given (1982 only).

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

KNB,EML,00717-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Soil nutrients and groundwater well site characterization data (1980-1985) methods Soil samples were collected on an annual basis for nutrient analysis, during the last week of June or early July (with the exception of 1984, when samples were collected in August and October). Soil samples were collected at five groundwater well sites per cell (in all cells except 9, where samples were collected from the 10 groundwater (GW) well sites), using the invertebrate core sampler (5 cm inner diameter, 20 cm length; Kadlec, 1985a). Enough cores were taken to completely fill a wide-mouth Mason jar, which was labeled with the date, and groundwater well number. All soil nutrient samples were sent to the Provincial Soil Testing Lab at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada), to determine total nitrogen, available nitrogen, total phosphorous, available phosphorous, total sulpher, available potassium, sediment water content (as a percent of the soil dry weight) and percent organic matter (added in 1983). A master sheet with sample numbers 1-65 was used to keep track of each sample. As per requirements of the Soil Testing Lab, each wet sediment sample was homogenized in a blender before being transferred the sample boxes provided by the Soil Testing Lab, and stored in a freezer (Kadlec, 1985a). All anaylses were performed on wet samples. The analytic procedure was modified so that subsamples for analyses of available N (NO3--N + NO2-N), available P (dissolved and some adsorbed P), and available K were not dried prior to extraction, as drying affects extractable quantities of most ions in organic soils (Kadlec, 1989; Anderson and Beverly, 1985; Gilliam and Richter, 1985). N and P subsamples were extracted with 0.5M NaHCO3 at pH 8.5 and K subsamples with 1N NH4OAc at pH 7. The N and P extracts were analyzed on a Technicon Auto Analyzer, N by a modification of the procedure of Kampshake et al. (1967) and P by the ascorbic acid-ammonium molybdate method (Page et al., 1982). K was analyzed by flame photometry. Analyses for total P and total S were performed on dried sediment samples which were digested with HNO3 and HClO4. Total N was determined by the Kjeldahl method. Organic matter was determined by the potassium dichromate reduction procedure (Page et al., 1982). In addition to the Manitoba Provincial Soil Testing Laboratory measured sediment water content, at the field laboratory, separate known volume cores, taken at the same time as the cores for nutrient analysis, were analyzed for dry weight and water per unit volume. However, this data was not able to be archived. Because of the range in sediment consistency in the marshes, Kaldec (1989) was also not confident that the coring technique provided accurate data for bulk density calculations. Nevertheless, it was the best available procedure for largescale routine use at the time. Sampling for the characterization of macrophytes at groundwater well sites occurred once in late July or early August during the sampling season, as this is the period where standing emergents reach their maximum standing crop. The groundwater well sites were examined for plant species present, density or percent cover, and live or dead plants. To characterize the sites, a square meter quadrat was randomly placed within a 2 metre radius of the well site. Within the quadrat, the number of stems of emergent or upland species were counted. For submergent species, a percent cover value in the total quadrat area was estimated. Macrophytes were coded to species when possible. For the 1982 sampling year only, surveys also recorded if the species was live or dead. Notes on reading the data: -Note that, for 1982 soil nutrient analyses, TN, TP and TS at all marsh sites (including the control cells 11 &12) decreased significantly, as compared to soil nutrient values for all other years. No explanation related to the experiment could be provided from the Kadlec (1989) publication, as well as from consultation with soil nutrient experts, for this anomalous data. As QA/QC data were not available for the Manitoba Provincial Soil Testing Laboratory reports for 1982, the possibility of an error related to laboratory analyses should not be overlooked. Therefore, the 1982 soil nutrient data should be treated with caution. -For nutrient analyses on soil samples, zero values indicate that a particular parameter was measured and its’ value was zero. -For nutrient analyses on soil samples, blanks for a particular parameter indicate that an insufficient amount of sample was available to run a particular analysis, that a sample was not able to be taken/recorded properly and that information is considered to be lost, or that a particular parameter was not recorded in that sampling year (i.e. percent organic matter for 1980-1982). -For 1982 soil nutrient analyses, TN, TP and TS at all marsh sites (including the control cells 11 &12) decreased significantly, as compared to soil nutrient values for all other years. No explanation could be provided in the Kadlec (1989) publication, as well as from consultation with soil nutrient experts, for this anomalous data. As QA/QC data were not available for the Manitoba Provincial Soil Testing Laboratory reports for 1982, the possibility of an error related to laboratory analyses should not be overlooked. Therefore, the 1982 soil nutrient data should be treated with caution. -For vegetation data on groundwater well site characterizations, zero values for both quadrat density/percent cover value and species indicates that there was no vegetation at that particular groundwater well site. -For vegetation data on groundwater well site characterizations, a blank entry indicates: -where a particular parameter was not recorded for that sampling year (i.e. ‘live or dead’ in all sampling years but 1982), or -that a sample was not able to be taken/recorded properly at that groundwater well site and that the information is considered to be lost, or -a total for all other (unknown or minor) ‘live’ or ‘dead’ species, where the ‘plant species present’ parameter is blank, but a value for ‘live or dead’ and ‘density or cover value’ is given (1982 only).

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

KNB,EML,00718-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Since 1959, this survey has developed indices for the abundance of young striped bass when the average size is 38 mm by sampling 31 stations from San Pablo Bay through the Delta. The original purpose was to predict recruitment to the adult stock but the index has proven valuable in gauging the environmental health of the estuary. Young striped bass abundance is primarily a function of Delta outflow, Delta water exports and egg production. Abundance indices for other species have also revealed important trends. For example, the index for delta smelt was useful in determining its status as a threatened species. This survey is mandated by the 1995 USFWS Biological Opinion (BO) for delta smelt on the operation of the SWP and CVP."

KNB,EML,00719-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1tI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00721-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The pond complex is part of the De Maten nature reserve (50 degrees 57' N, 5 degrees 27' E) situated in the territory of Genk and Diepenbeek (Limburg province, Belgium; Figure 8.1). The area has been classified as a protected nature reserve since 1976 and now covers a surface of nearly 310 ha, of which 217 ha are managed by Natuurpunt vzw. The pond complex is a typical example of an ancient chain of fishing ponds. The ponds were created in the Middle Ages through peat digging and the construction of dykes. Fish farming continued until 1990 (Daniels 1998; W. Peumans, pers. comm.), but fish are still present in the ponds. All ponds studied are shallow (mean depth approximately 0.5 m) and eutrophied (except Pond 1). The pond complex is 3 Km long and 1.5 Km wide). There is a unidirectional flow of water from the upstream pond in the northeast corner of the nature reserve (Pond 32) at 55 m above sea level to the ponds in the southern end of the system at approximately 40 m above sea level. Almost half of the water in the system comes from two rivulets, and the remainder comes from ground water. The main rivulet, the Stiemerbeek, feeds Pond 32 and all downstream ponds. The second rivulet, the Heiweyerbeek, feeds a subset of ponds located in the northwest corner of the area and flows directly into Pond 18. At the southwest end of the pond complex, the water is diverted back into the Stiemerbeek, which flows into the Demer River. A subset of the pond complex (13 ponds, 8 from the upstream subgroup, and 5 from the downstream subgroup, with no direct water connection between the two subgroups) was sampled on 7 different dates between April 13 and July 17 1999, following an experimental manipulation of the different ponds (stocking with pike fingerlings and removing the water)."

KNB,EML,00723-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997).From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00724-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract," Ecologists have argued about the commonness and strength of interspecific competition between insect herbivores, but facilitation between herbivores has received much less consideration. We previously found that when two species of folivorous caterpillars co-occurred on a shared host plant, feeding by early season tiger moth caterpillars reduced the growth and reproduction of later season tussock caterpillars. However, densities of tussock caterpillars in summer were positively correlated with densities of tiger moth caterpillars the following spring. 2. In this study, we experimentally manipulated numbers of feeding tussock caterpillars and found that they facilitated tiger moth caterpillars. 3. The depth of the litter layer beneath host lupine bushes was positively correlated with the number of tussock caterpillars feeding on each bush. Experimental additions of litter beneath lupine canopies during summer resulted in increased numbers of tiger moth caterpillars in the following spring, indicating a causal role of litter. Litter potentially provides food, habitat and protection from desiccation and predation. We failed to find evidence that tussock caterpillars facilitated tiger moth caterpillars by mechanisms independent of litter. 4. Our study demonstrates that facilitation may operate between insect herbivores, across life-stages through indirect interactions that are non-trophic. Facilitation operated by a novel mechanism, the accumulation of litter which was a by-product of feeding by one species was valuable to a second species. Facilitation persisted in time and space far beyond the creation of litter by tussock caterpillars which should be considered important ecosystem engineers from the point of view of tiger moths. Facilitations that involve habitat modification may generally connect species that do not interact directly or trophically, and have not previously been considered to affect one another.

KNB,EML,00725-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00728-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CLike B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability, but the character of this world differs substantially. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity."

The digitized data included here are from the spring and autumn censuses of 1981. The original data from all years are archived and publicly available at the Cornell University Llibrary, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections: Richard Root Papers, #14-35-4058. Previous publications based on these data focused on a number of questions: (1) (a) to what extent the functional structure of the community was maintained by compensatory changes in the densities of the member species, and (b) whether certain traits were associated with a species' tendency to fluctuate in density or to dominate the community (Root, R.B. and N. Cappuccino, 1992) and (2) in combination with insect removal experiments, measuring temporal variation in herbivore pressure and plant phenotypic responses to different levels of insect herbivory (Root, R.B., 1996)."

The fields were selected using the following criteria: (a) the area containing goldenrods exceeded 7000 M2, (b) the Solidago altissima population exceeded 5000 ramets, (c) the site was well isolated from pesticide drift and road dust, (d) the area was protected from disturbance (none of these fields were mowed, burned, or trampled during the study), (e) the successional age of the site was such that the goldenrod clones were well established but woody plants were small and scattered (none of the plants sampled in this study grew in the shade of woody plants), (f) the site was relatively level and well drained, and (h) other large stands of goldenrods grew within a 1-km radius of the field. We did not sample any 'linear' stands of goldenrods that grow along roadsides, ditches, or fences. We observed no obvious successional changes in the vegetation structure at our study sites over the course of the investigation. The survey in 1981 included 16 sites. We visited each site in both the first week of June and mid-September. The exact timing of each census was determined by phenological indicators rather than calendar date; the June census was begun when the majority of Trirhabda virgata larvae (a dominant herbivore species) were beginning to molt to third instar, and the September census was begun when S. altissima reached peak bloom. At each site, two parallel transects, 125 m long and 20 m apart, were walked during each census period. Every fifth stride, a single goldenrod stem was chosen haphazardly (by taking the nearest ramet to a spot on the ground selected by pointing a meter stick while walking with the eyes focused on the opposite side of the transect), measured, and searched carefully for herbivores. Care was taken to observe any insect that flew or dropped from the plant as we approached. Fortunately, most insects in this fauna are relatively placid and remain on the plant, even when it is cut and handled. Fifty stems from each field were sampled in June; forty were sampled in September. After each September sample, we searched an additional 60 stems per site for stem gall-making insects. All invertebrate herbivores were recorded. In 1981 and 1982 representatives of each taxon were collected and brought back to the laboratory to be dried and weighed. We were able to identify only a portion of the fauna to species in the field; those we could not were lumped into larger taxonomic groups. As the study progressed, we were able to recognize accurately more species in the field. Thus some species that were lumped initially were counted separately in later years.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ"

KNB,EML,00740-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Desert annual plants have played an important role as model organisms in the development of understanding of how organisms adapt to variable and unpredictable environments. They have also been used to exemplify ideas about non-equilibrium community dynamics. The goal of this data set is to provide a comprehensive long-term data set on demographic variation and covariation for a guild of desert winter annual plants. Germination, survival fecundity and seed bank dynamics have been assessed on a set of permanent plots since 1982 at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona. Data is provided for individual plant including germination date, death date, fecundity, viable seed bank and in some years, Cartesian coordinates within plots. Viable seed densities for replicated soil samples are provided for all species since 1990. A species by year summary of vital rates is also provided."

KNB,EML,00740-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data Table OverviewThis data package consists of four ASCII data tables stored in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format : census data.csv (3753 KB), Seed Bank.csv (3356 KB), species list.csv (17 KB), species x year.csv (15 KB).NOTE: These files are updated on a regular basis by the data set owner. They may be downloaded at: http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/venable/LTREB/LTREB%20data.htm#data.Comprehensive attribute metadata for each table is presented at: http://www.eebweb.arizona.edu/faculty/venable/LTREB/metadata.htm.Experimental DesignThere are seventy two permanent plots randomly placed along two parallel transects. At each of thirty six random positions along the transects there is one plot under a creosote bush shrub canopy and a matching open plot at least 1m from the nearest shrub.Permanent Plots: 0.1 m2 permanent plots.Data Collection Period and FrequencyIn 1982 I began censusing 15 permanent plots along a 250 m transect at the study site. In 1989, 48 additional long-term study plots were established and in 1991 the total number was increased to 72, one half being located under shrubs and one half in the open. The plots have been visited following each rainfall during the germination season to check for germination. When there is more than trace germination (> 1% of expected total year germination) a germination census is conducted. Following a germination census, subsequent censuses are conducted at intervals sufficiently short to recognize individual plants and distinguish survival from mortality followed by new germination (i.e., every 30-45 days). Frequently, more than one cohort per year emerges from precipitation associated with different storm systems. Each cohort is scored separately. Fecundity has been scored on a random subsample of five surviving plants from each species in each cohort in each plot at the end of the growing season. In early years 1982- 199? it was recorded for every surviving plant. Systematic annual collection of soil cores for seed bank analysis began in 1990. The cores are collected after the germination season, but prior to seed set from the following season, i.e., in February of each year.Research Methods: Field/LaboratoryEach seedling is mapped with exact location and species identity with colored markers on acetate sheets placed with fixed coordinates over plexiglass mapping tables. The mapping tables are set over the plots in the field. At the end of the season, maps are scored to record germination and death dates, and fecundity for individual plants. This sampling and data recording scheme has been used consistently for the whole period of data collection. From this data we have calculated mean survival from germination to reproduction and mean fecundity of survivors for each cohort of each species in shrub and open habitats each year. From this we calculated the average seed set per seedling (per capita reproductive success) for each cohort of each species in the open and shrub habitats each year (proportion surviving times mean fecundity of survivors).Research Methods: Collection and Sampling StategyWe collect 180 soil cores (5.4 cm diameter x 2.5 cm deep) annually using stratified random sampling (Benoit et al. 1989) along a transect connecting the 2 demographic transects for the 24- and 17-year old plots. Half of the samples are obtained from under creosote shrubs and half from open sites. The cores are collected after the germination season, but prior to seed set from the following season. Thus the viable seeds in these samples have forgone germination in at least one season. Viable seeds rarely occur below 2.5 cm in the study area. Samples are placed in paper bags to insure evaporation of any soil moisture, and if the soil is moist at the time of collection, the paper bags are opened and placed beneath fans to insure rapid drying with no further rot or germination. Seeds and organic material are separated from soil particles using a repetitive frothing, flotation, and filtering technique which has been shown to retrieve >95% of seeds in blind tests. Individual soil samples are mixed with tap water and stirred vigorously. The suspension containing floating organic matter and small soil particles are then immediately decanted through an organza-cloth filter placed in a Buchner funnel attached to suction. This filter has been shown to capture all seeds of the smallest-seeded species in this guild of annual plants (Evax multicaulis, mean seed size, 0.025 mg). This process is repeated multiple times until the decanted liquid is clear. Then the organza filter and debris are placed in a labeled petri dish and oven dried for >24 hrs at 40C. The organic matter with seeds is then sifted with standard testing sieves and all fractions that potentially contain seeds from the annual plant guild are spread out a spoonful at a time and examined under a dissecting microscope. All seeds are separated, counted, and identified to species by comparison to voucher seeds. The seeds are cut or poked through the seed coat to determine viability. Seeds with juicy, oily, or fleshy embryos or endosperm are scored as viable. Tetrazolium chloride testing gives inferior results due to the difficulty of manipulating our smallest seeds and because some deeply dormant viable seeds show only minimal staining. Under the field conditions from which these soil samples are collected seeds usually undergo easily recognizable changes upon death (dessication or decay of endosperm or embryo). Counting of viable seeds is superior for our system to the germination-based procedures sometimes used in other seed bank studies because viable seeds of our species often do not germinate completely (Adondakis and Venable 2004).N/ATaxonomy and SystematicsPlant names are per Bowers and Turner (1985)."

KNB,EML,00740-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"1. Site description: Permanent quadrats were established in 1982 at the northwest base of Tumamoc Hill at the Desert Laboratory of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona. Site type: The site (725 m elevation) is a gently sloped creosote flat dominated by Larrea divaricata (creosote bush), which has 50% cover. The site is located in the Arizona Upland subdivision of the Sonoran Desert. Geography: The study site is located at the northwest base of Tumamoc Hill 1 mile west of downtown Tucson, AZ (32'13' N, 111'01' W). Habitat: See 'Site type' above. The quadrats extend along a transect from a flat alluvial area and up the southeast side of a gently sloping (9Â°) hill,. Geology: Plots are located along a gently sloping bajada (fluvial piedmont) of consistent parent material, where a strong transition occurs in the age of the soil surface with elevation. The soil on the slope is composed of basaltic andesite (Phillips 1976) with a coarse sandy-loam texture (67% sand, 20% silt, 13% clay) and with fragments ofbasaltic rocks embedded in the surface. The surrounding lower areas have recently derived alluvial soil, including sandy-clay soil at the base of the hill (54% sand, 22% silt, 24% clay) and loamy-sand soil in a series of shallow (<0.5 m deep) and narrow (2-3 m wide) dry drainage channels (79% sand, 10Â°/o silt, 10% clay). The slope is rockier (50% gravel) than the base of the hill (20% gravel) or rivulets (25% gravel) (Pantastico-Caldas and Venable 1993). Watersheds/hydrology: N/A Site history: The 850 acre Desert laboratory site was fences in 1906 to protect it from cattle grazing and it has been an ecological preserve subsequently. Climate: The site receives ~300 mm of annual precipitation on average, about half of which falls during the summer monsoons (JulyâSeptember), with the rest occurring sporadically through the remainder of the year (Bowers and Turner 1985).-111.01-110.8989900000000132.232.2"

KNB,EML,00746-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

KNB,EML,00748-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The ECHAM climate model has been developed from the ECMWF atmospheric model (therefore the first part of its name: EC) and a comprehensive parameterisation package developed at Hamburg therefore the abbreviation HAM) which allows the model to be used for climate simulations. The model is a spectral transform model with 19 atmospheric layers and the results used here derive from experiments performed with spatial resolution T42 (which approximates to about 2.8 degrees longitude/latitude resolution). The model has also been used at resolutions in the range T21 to T106. ECHAM4 is the current generation in the line of ECHAM models (Roeckner, et al., 1992). A summary of developments regarding model physics in ECHAM4 and a description of the simulated climate obtained with the uncoupled ECHAM4 model is given in Roeckner et al. (1996). The initial sea surface temperature and sea-ice data is the COLA/CAC AMIP SST and sea-ice data set. The mean terrain heights are computed from high resolution US Navy data set. The fraction of grid area covered by vegetation based on the Wilson and Henderson-Sellers (1985) data set. The ocean albedo is a function of solar zenith angle and the land albedo from the satellite data of Geleyn and Preuss (1983). A diurnal cycle and gravity wave-drag is included. The time-step of the model is 24 minutes, except for radiation which uses two hours. The ocean model is an updated version of the isopycnal model (OPYC3) developed by Josef Oberhuber (Oberhuber, 1993) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany. The name OPYC is derived from Ocean and isoPYCnal co-ordinates. The concept to use isopycnals as the vertical co-ordinate system for an OGCM is based on the observation that the interior ocean behaves as a rather conservative fluid. Even over long distances the origin of water masses can be traced back by considering the distribution of active or passive tracers. Treating the ocean as a conservative fluid fails in areas of significant turbulence activity such as the surface boundary layer. A surface mixed-layer is therefore coupled to the interior ocean in order to represent near-surface vertical mixing and to improve the response time-scales to atmospheric forcing which is controlled by the mixed-layer thickness. Since the model is designed for studies on large scales, a sea ice model with rheology is included and serves the purpose of de-coupling the ocean from extreme high-latitude winter conditions and promotes a realistic treatment of the salinity forcing due to melting or freezing sea ice. The experiments from which results are used here are the 1000-year unforced control simulation using the coupled ECHAM4/OPYC3 model and then two climate change simulations. The greenhouse gas only forced experiment (referred to as GGa1) used historical greenhouse gas forcing from 1860 to 1990 followed by a 1 per cent annum increase in radiative forcing from 1990 to 2099. The greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forced experiment (referred to as GSa1) used the GGa1 forcing, plus the negative forcing due to sulphate aerosols. This was represented by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading. The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. For 1860 to 1990 the historic sulphate aerosol forcing estimate was used and for 1990 to 2049 the aerosol forcing estimated for the IS92a emissions scenario. The GSa1 experiment did not extend beyond 2049. Fuller details of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 coupled model can be found at the DDC Yellow Pages. Several papers describe results using this version of the model - see Bacher et al. (1998), Oberhuber et al. (1998), Zhang et al. (1998). The climate sensitivity of ECHAM4 is about 2.6 degrees C.The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability, but the character of this world differs substantially. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity."

KNB,EML,00753-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The data originates from national monitoring on the effects of the Finnish agri-environment support scheme (MYTVAS). The effects of buffer zones on biodiversity were studied in a case study of 21 buffer zones of differing age in southern Finland in summer 2009. Vascular plants and day-active Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) were studied as biodiversity indicators. Their species richness in buffer zones was compared to other linear uncultivated semi-natural habitats available in the study landscapes, i.e. forest edges and field margins, and particularly the field margin between the studied buffer zone and the neighboring waterway. In each of 21 landscapes, data was collected on ten 50 m long transect lines, of which two were located in each habitat type. Several environmental variables were evaluated on the transect lines and in surrounding landscape. The methods are described in the following publication: Heliölä, J., Virtanen, L., Sandholm, L. & Kuussaari, M. 2010b. Suojavyöhykkeiden merkitys putkilokasvien ja suurper-hosten monimuotoisuudelle.

KNB,EML,00753-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data on vascular plants Data on vascular plants was collected in June-July on the transect lines being located on the buffer zones and the field margins between the buffer zones and the neighboring waterways. The other semi-natural habitats were not included to the plant study. Coverages of vascular plant species were evaluated on the whole area of the 50 m long and 1 m wide lines by using a nine-class scale (1<0,125 %; 2=0,125 – 0,5 %; 3=0,5 - 2 %; 4=2 – 4 %; 5=4 – 8 %; 6=8 –16 %; 7=16 – 32 %; 8=32 – 64 %; 9>64 %). Additionally, coverages of plant species were evaluated per cent on two 1 x 1 m quadrates on each line. The quadrates were located so that the centre of a quadrate was at the distance of 17 m from the end of the line and 16 m from the centre of the other quadrate. In total, 84 transect lines and 168 quadrates were studied. Data on day-active Lepidoptera Monitoring of pollinators was carried out using the standard line-transect method (Pollard & Yates 1993), in which a transect route is walked at a steady speed and all individuals within a 5 x 5 m square ahead are recorded. The counts were carried out on all the 210 transect lines seven times in May-August at approximately 2-week intervals in weather conditions allowing insect activity. Pollard, E. & Yates, T. 1993. Monitoring butterflies for ecology and conservation. Chapman & Hall. London, UK. 274 p. Environmental variables The environmental variables were divided into two groups: the variables measuring the local habitat quality on the transect line, and the variables measuring the quality of the surrounding landscape. Some of the variables were evaluated only on the transect lines where the plant data was collected, i.e. on the buffer zones and the field margins between the buffer zones and the neighboring waterways. The surrounding landscape was studied by mapping the coverages of different habitat types: fields, forests, meadow patches and other habitats within a radius of both 100 m and 500 m of the transect line of the studied buffer zone."

KNB,EML,00753-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data on vascular plants Data on vascular plants was collected in June-July on the transect lines being located on the buffer zones and the field margins between the buffer zones and the neighboring waterways. The other semi-natural habitats were not included to the plant study. Coverages of vascular plant species were evaluated on the whole area of the 50 m long and 1 m wide lines by using a nine-class scale (1<0,125 %; 2=0,125 – 0,5 %; 3=0,5 - 2 %; 4=2 – 4 %; 5=4 – 8 %; 6=8 –16 %; 7=16 – 32 %; 8=32 – 64 %; 9>64 %). Additionally, coverages of plant species were evaluated per cent on two 1 x 1 m quadrates on each line. The quadrates were located so that the centre of a quadrate was at the distance of 17 m from the end of the line and 16 m from the centre of the other quadrate. In total, 84 transect lines and 168 quadrates were studied. Data on day-active Lepidoptera Monitoring of pollinators was carried out using the standard line-transect method (Pollard & Yates 1993), in which a transect route is walked at a steady speed and all individuals within a 5 x 5 m square ahead are recorded. The counts were carried out on all the 210 transect lines seven times in May-August at approximately 2-week intervals in weather conditions allowing insect activity. Pollard, E. & Yates, T. 1993. Monitoring butterflies for ecology and conservation. Chapman & Hall. London, UK. 274 p. Environmental variables The environmental variables were divided into two groups: the variables measuring the local habitat quality on the transect line, and the variables measuring the quality of the surrounding landscape. Some of the variables were evaluated only on the transect lines where the plant data was collected, i.e. on the buffer zones and the field margins between the buffer zones and the neighboring waterways. The surrounding landscape was studied by mapping the coverages of different habitat types: fields, forests, meadow patches and other habitats within a radius of both 100 m and 500 m of the transect line of the studied buffer zone."

KNB,EML,00754-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Productivity of a boreal coniferous forest was determined at the Flakaliden experimental site for a yield optimisation study, beginning in 1986. The principal aim was to determine the potential yield of a young stand of Norway spruce Picea abies, under given climatic conditions, non-limiting soil water and optimal nutritional status without leaching to groundwater. The 8.25 ha Flakaliden study site (64.12 N 19.45 E) is situated in northern Sweden, about 60 km west of the city of Umeaa. The site has a harsh boreal climate with short cool summers of long days, and long, cold winters of short days. Monthly mean air temperature ranges from -8.7 C in February to 14.4 C in July. More than one-third of precipitation falls as snow. The study site was planted with 4-yr old seedlings in 1963 after clear-felling. The fertilisation experiment, consisting of four treatments with four replicates each (100 m x 50 m plots), commenced in 1987. Treatments comprised irrigation with sprinklers, solid fertilisation, irrigation with liquid fertiliser, and a control. The annual dose of nitrogen was initially 100 kg N per ha, the other nutrients (P, K, Ca, S, Mg) being supplied in fixed proportion to N, adjusted annually against needle samples, in an attempt to attain the optimal nutrient dose. The N dose was reduced 25 percent in 1990. Complete inventories were carried out in 1986, 1991 and 1996, determining height and diameter at breast height for every tree. In the intervening years, about 100 trees per treatment were sub-sampled. After three years' treatment, height and diameter growth in both fertilised stands was double that of the control stand. After 10 years, volume growth of fertilised stands was almost four times that of the control. There was no effect of irrigation on growth. Data from this site were used to parameterise and test the BIOMASS process-based model: parameter values are available from the references below. Total net primary production of a 36-year old untreated stand in 1995 was estimated at 291 g/m2/year (above-ground = 198; below-ground = 93 g/m2/year), and increased more than three times in the irrigated and fertilised treatment to 902 g/m2/year, with more carbon allocated to shoot than root growth (above-ground = 678; below-ground = 224 g/m2/year)."

KNB,EML,00755-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Changes in territorial behavior of blackchinned hummingbirds (Archilochus alexandri) in response to experimental changes in territory quality were investigated using artificial feeders and simultaneous, pair-wise observations of owners. Some of the responses of A. alexandri were similar to those documented by a previous study of the Anna's hummingbird (Calypte anna): A. alexandri defending rich territories spent more time on their territories, encountered a greater percentage of intruders, and chased more intruders than did A. alexandri defending poor territories. In contrast to C. anna, A. alexandri supplemented chases with energetically inexpensive threat vocalizations more extensively when territory quality was increased. This difference may be related to A. alexandri's more tenuous control of rich territories. When both species were observed on very poor territories, A. alexandri chased a greater percentage of intruders, consumed a greater proportion of available food, and obtained a greater net energy gain from their territories. When observed simultaneously on territories with ad lib food, both species defended highly exclusive territories but A. alexandri suffered higher intrusion pressure and spent more time and energy in defense. These interspecific differences in territorial behavior may facilitate sympatric coexistence of the two species through aggressive partitioning of flower patches according to productivity: the greater payoff received by C. anna on rich territories and A. alexandri on poor territories should favor a corresponding monopolization of rich areas by C. anna and poor areas by A. alexandri."

KNB,EML,00756-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997). From the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in this storyline from 'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."
