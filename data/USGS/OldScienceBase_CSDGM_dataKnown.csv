53c7e664e4b0194841642527.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The Upper Mississippi River Restoration-Environmental Management Program (UMRR-EMP) partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Region 3 to collect 2011 digital color infrared (CIR) aerial photography of Pools 14 - Open River South, Mississippi River and Pools Dresden - Lockport, Illinois River at 16”/pixel using a mapping-grade Applanix DSS439 digital aerial camera. The photography shall be at a minimum accuracy of 5-10 meters and allow for the development of orthorectified photo mosaics by U.S. Geological Survey – Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (USGS-UMESC) for all or portions of the coverage area. The flights occurred during times of peak vegetation biomass, typically from late August through early September. The primary use of this photography is for the development of Land Cover / Land Use (LCU) databases of the UMRS by the USGS-UMESC. The photography and LCU databases are used in support of all stages of HREP project development and monitoring. In addition, the photography and maps are used for research and monitoring efforts conducted by the LTRM component in support of UMRR-EMP. The imagery is served over the internet as orthorectified pool mosaics by USGS-UMESC."

In years past the extent was road/railroad to road/railroad. Starting in 2000, the area photographed was expanded to base-of-bluff to base-of-bluff. The data are stored in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, zone 15 and North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)."

News – generally accepted for most species. However, some are followed up on with local biologists or by obtaining photos. Websites – depends on the website and author. Agency sites are generally taken as factual. Individual websites or fishing websites are generally contacted to obtain photos for proper species identification. Personal Communications/NAS database website reporting form The reporter and the species are considered. Agency personnel or biologists’ data are usually accepted – except for commonly misidentified species. People reporting common species known to be in the area reported are generally accepted. Anyone reporting a species significant to a new area is investigated. We ask for photos or specimens to verify the identification if available. Photos can be uploaded on the NAS database website reporting form. QA/QC: After the data are entered, they are reviewed by a second NAS database person and the entire entry is checked for completeness and accuracy: -All data are entered from the source document -The record has documentation attached to substantiate it, a pdf of literature or of e-mail exchanges -Photos are attached if there were any Outside Review: Our users are constantly reviewing the data and sometimes let us know if they find a problem. When we are able to make an identification, we consult other colleagues who have a greater expertise. Unknown"

Scientific Publications are accepted without review unless it is a very old publication or taxonomy has changed or the species has been re-identified. News is generally accepted for most species. However, some are followed up on with local biologists or by obtaining photos. These are generally the most difficult to identify species. Acceptance of web-based information depends on the website and author. Federal and state agency sites are generally taken as factual. Individual websites or fishing websites are followed up on, generally to obtain photos. For personal communications and reports submitted online, the reporter and the species are considered. Agency personnel or biologists are usually taken at their word – except for commonly misidentified species. People reporting common species known to be in the area reported are generally accepted. Anyone reporting a species significant to a new area is investigated. Our online reporting form allows for photo uploads, therefore, we ask for photos or specimens if they are available to verify the identification. ,After the data are entered, they are reviewed by a second person in the NAS Program. After all data are entered, the documentation (eg. literature, e-mail exchanges, and photos) to substantiate it are attached in the form of a PDF. Users are constantly reviewing the data and alert the NAS database contact person if they find a problem. Data entry forms have been programmed to maintain some relationships: hydrologic unit codes (huc) names and numbers are linked; country, state, and county names are linked via a FIPS dictionary; month must be 1-12; day 1-31; year must be the current year or less. Maps are periodically reviewed to look for “introduced” locations in “native” ranges. NatureServe provided the native range data for fish and mussels. When discrepancies are found, historic literature and museum collections are searched to determine if the introduced location falls in the native range or not. Data are entered based on reports sent to us or discovered in publications. Not all sites are sampled in all years, they are opportunistic reports. This data set should not be assumed to be complete. We are not aware of all introductions nationwide. Hence, these data should not be the sole source for analysis. The goal is to show distribution; not to document abundance. These data are intended to give an overview rather than detailed local information. Data are known to be incomplete for certain regions, time periods, and/or taxa. They are also known to be incomplete for nearly all marine species, except fishes. We partner with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center on marine and estuarine species. Not all specimens/reports are included in the database; after a species is well-established in an area data are no longer entered. If a species is stocked every year, we only include a record every few years to indicate it is still there. Data are added and modified on a daily basis. Accuracy of the horizontal locations varies widely. Some data have accurate GPS coordinates, while other coordinates were determined by the location description. Some portion of the data is mapped as a centroid in either a county, or USGS 8-digit and 4-digit hydrologic unit codes. Accuracy of each point is indicated by “accurate”, “approximate”, or “centroid” in a separate field of each record. Data are intended to be used on a broad scale; accuracy decreases at small scales. Latitude and longitude are either reported to us by people who use GPS in the field or we derive them using the USGS Geographic Names Information System and its Google Maps feature. Number of digits does not reflect the precision of the point.

54a1905ae4b0bb7b6f9a1a3c.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014). For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center. In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products were revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov."

54a1905ae4b0bb7b6f9a1a3c.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Landsat image selection and preprocessing: For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two 2-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis: Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP - http//fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits, imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis: For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013). Four indices were integrated into one model to more accurately detect true spectral changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification: Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2011 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product): Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover Version (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product): A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change: The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition)and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database Process Step for NLCD 2011 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a1905ae4b0bb7b6f9a1a3c.xml,Resource Lineage,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Landsat image selection and preprocessing: For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two 2-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis: Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP - http//fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits, imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis: For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013). Four indices were integrated into one model to more accurately detect true spectral changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification: Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2011 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product): Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover Version (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product): A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change: The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition)and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database Process Step for NLCD 2011 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

This NLCD product is the version dated October 10, 2014. N/A N/A Landsat image selection and preprocessing: For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two 2-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis: Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States.

A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis: For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013).

The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification: Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009).

Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2011 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product): Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover Version (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product): A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change: The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition)and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product): Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover Version (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product): A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change: The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition)and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database Process Step for NLCD 2011 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a1905ae4b0bb7b6f9a1a3c.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"Landsat image selection and preprocessing: For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two 2-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis: Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP - http//fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits, imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis: For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013). Four indices were integrated into one model to more accurately detect true spectral changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification: Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2011 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. This land cover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered 'provisional' until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 Edition) for all 66 MRLC mapping zones.

54a19384e4b0bb7b6f9a1a45.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Process Step for NLCD 2001 Original Version: The land cover classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data. The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data is required. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover, training data were collected from several combined sources. Note that the training data were used to map all land cover classes except for four classes in urban and sub-urban areas (developed open space, low intensity developed, medium intensity developed, high intensity developed). All urban and suburban land cover classes were mapped and quality assessed separately through a sub-pixel quantification of impervious surfaces using a regression tree modeling method. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps were required to complete the final land cover product. The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section). The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). Other classes of forest and non-forest were combined with the urban classes to complete the land cover product. Finally visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an 'area of interest' (AOI), subsequently then limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI. The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a 'smart eliminate' algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.

Landsat ETM, DOQQ, USDA, FIA, DEM, USGS EROS, IKONOS Unknown USGS NLCD Process Step for NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 Edition): To improve NLCD imperviousness, the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern half of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 edition, amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a19384e4b0bb7b6f9a1a45.xml,Resource Lineage,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Process Step for NLCD 2001 Original Version: The land cover classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data. The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data is required. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover, training data were collected from several combined sources. Note that the training data were used to map all land cover classes except for four classes in urban and sub-urban areas (developed open space, low intensity developed, medium intensity developed, high intensity developed). All urban and suburban land cover classes were mapped and quality assessed separately through a sub-pixel quantification of impervious surfaces using a regression tree modeling method. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps were required to complete the final land cover product. The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section). The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). Other classes of forest and non-forest were combined with the urban classes to complete the land cover product. Finally visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an 'area of interest' (AOI), subsequently then limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI. The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a 'smart eliminate' algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.

This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern half of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 edition, amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

No formal independent accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover has been made. The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for land cover predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover modeling, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs were computed. Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment. This land cover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered 'provisional' until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. 78.7 The value above represents the overall accuracy of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 1.0 layer at Anderson Level II as reported in the following manuscript: Wickham, J.

54a19384e4b0bb7b6f9a1a45.xml,Resource Quality Description,/metadata/dataqual,"The information on data quality for the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition was generated by the Decision Tree algorithm that conducts a cross-validation for assessing classification and prediction reliability. No formal independent accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover has been made. The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for land cover predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition land cover modeling, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs were computed. Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment. This land cover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered 'provisional' until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. 78.7 The value above represents the overall accuracy of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 1.0 layer at Anderson Level II as reported in the following manuscript: Wickham, J. D., Stehman S. V., Fry, J. A., Smith, J. H., & Homer, C. G., (2010), Thematic accuracy of the NLCD 2001 land cover for the conterminous United States, Remote Sensing of Environment, 114, 1286 - 1296. An accuracy assessment of the revised portions of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition layer has not been completed and those areas are considered provisional until a formal accuracy assessment has been completed. The U.S. Geological Survey can make no guarantee as to the accuracy or completeness of this information, and it is provided with the understanding that it is not guaranteed to be correct or complete. Conclusions drawn from this information are the responsibility of the user. The NLCD 2001 database for the NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition consists of three main data products including: (1) per pixel classified land-cover data (2) sub-pixel percent imperviousness and (3) sub-pixel percent tree canopy density. Additional information may be found at http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k_nlcd.asp. NLCD 2001 Land Cover 2011 Edition dated October 10, 2014. N/A N/A Process Step for NLCD 2001 Original Version: The land cover classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data. The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data is required. For the NLCD 2001 Land Cover, training data were collected from several combined sources. Note that the training data were used to map all land cover classes except for four classes in urban and sub-urban areas (developed open space, low intensity developed, medium intensity developed, high intensity developed). All urban and suburban land cover classes were mapped and quality assessed separately through a sub-pixel quantification of impervious surfaces using a regression tree modeling method. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps were required to complete the final land cover product. The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section). The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). Other classes of forest and non-forest were combined with the urban classes to complete the land cover product. Finally visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an 'area of interest' (AOI), subsequently then limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI. The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a 'smart eliminate' algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.

Landsat ETM, DOQQ, USDA, FIA, DEM, USGS EROS, IKONOS Unknown USGS NLCD Process Step for NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 Edition): To improve NLCD imperviousness, the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern half of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2001 Land Cover (2011 edition, amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture -Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC. NLCD 2011 is the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation. The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014). For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover; 2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness; 4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels; and 5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center. In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change. All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail). All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2011 products can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov."

54a19578e4b0bb7b6f9a1a4b.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two, two-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium-intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013). Four indices were integrated into one model to more accurately detect true spectral changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2006 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition) and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database Process Step for NLCD 2011 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two, two-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium-intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2011 Land Cover Update, a variation of the Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) used in NLCD 2006 spectral change analysis was refined to capture land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin et al. 2013). Four indices were integrated into one model to more accurately detect true spectral changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2006 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition) and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database Process Step for NLCD 2011 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium-intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%).

Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2006) and late date (circa 2011) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. For NLCD 2011, two image pairs of circa 2006 and circa 2011, ideally one leaf-on pair and one leaf-off pair are used interactively in each path/row. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used to identify potential change pixels that are then labeled with the NLCD 2011 class. NLCD 2011 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2011 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2006 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2006 and 2011 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2011 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2006 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2006 pixel. NLCD 2011 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2006 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2011 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover products were corrected with the revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Editions), included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release. NLCD 2011 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were implemented to create the final NLCD 2011 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2011 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition), and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2011 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition) base and the NLCD 2011 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2011 Change Pixels. NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. The NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition) and the NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that depicts imperviousness change between 2006 and 2011.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database Process Step for NLCD 2011 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

For NLCD 2011 change analysis, two, two-date pairs of Landsat scenes were selected for each path/row to represent ground conditions in circa 2006 and 2011. One additional circa 2011 scene was selected to enhance modeling results for land cover labeling. In selecting the 5 scenes, the temporal range of the imagery was restricted to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized and masked. NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). These same procedures were employed to produce NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness and 2006-2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change. First, 2009 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2006 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2006 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2011 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2011 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2006 and 2011 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2006 impervious surface products to retain 2006 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2009 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2011 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2006 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2011 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (Class 21) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (Class 22) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (Class 23) medium-intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (Class 24) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Revised products, NLCD 2001 and NLCD 2006 Impervious (2011 Editions) and NLCD 2001-2006 Impervious Change Pixels (2011 Edition) are included as part of the NLCD 2011 product release.

54a195a1e4b0bb7b6f9a1a4d.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001 2011 Edition) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006 2011 Edition) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 (2011 edition) is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 (2011 Edition) and 2006 (2011 Edition) for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition), there are 4 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition); 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Land Cover Change Pixels (2011 Edition) labeled with the 2006 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition), and 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (2011 Edition). In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates included in the attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered 'provisional' until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov."

54a195a1e4b0bb7b6f9a1a4d.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Original NLCD 2006 processing is described in this process step. Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database NLCD 2006 (2011) Edition Processing Steps - To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2006 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a195a1e4b0bb7b6f9a1a4d.xml,Resource Lineage,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Original NLCD 2006 processing is described in this process step. Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database NLCD 2006 (2011) Edition Processing Steps - To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2006 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013).

Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map.

Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database NLCD 2006 (2011) Edition Processing Steps - To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2006 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a195a1e4b0bb7b6f9a1a4d.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"Original NLCD 2006 processing is described in this process step. Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95).

The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution. For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp. The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones. A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge-matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics. This update represents a seamless assembly of updated NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness for all 66 MRLC mapping zones.

54a195cbe4b0bb7b6f9a1a50.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"The method employed to map percent developed imperviousness for NLCD 2001 consists of three key steps: deriving reference data of imperviousness from the high spatial resolution images, calibrating density prediction models using reference data and Landsat spectral bands, and extrapolating the developed models spatially to map per-pixel imperviousness. This method is described in detail in Yang et al. (2003). Unknown To develop adequate training data for impervious estimation, approximately 20 DOQQ's across each mapping zone with a nominal spatial resolution of 1-m were classified into either pervious or non-pervious surfaces, and then summed within each 30 meter Landsat pixel cell to obtain percentage of imperviousness. Training data were selected based on the degree of variance each training data set possesses with regards to Landsat ETM+ imagery used for mapping. Each added training data set decreased the amount of variance present within the Landsat data as a whole. The selection process was repeated until the amount of variance explained reached a pre-defined threshold. By combining the training data with Landsat spectral data and other ancillary data, percent imperviousness prediction models were developed using a regression tree algorithm (named 'Cubist'). All data layers used as input for running the Cubist, in order to establish the prediction model for imperviousness are listed in the 'Supplemental Information' section. Three ancillary data sets were used for urban/suburban delineation masking, which is essential to confine the imperviousness mapping within the developed areas. After the best combination of possible input data layers had been determined and the final percent impervious layer produced, the urban mask created was used to eliminate those pixels from the final percent impervious file that fall outside identified impervious surface areas. Thus, the impervious pixels identified within the mask were retained, while all non-impervious surface pixels were removed from the final product. This corrected for any small areas of pixels that may have been included as part of the impervious surface layer because their spectral signature was not covered in the Cubist modeling process. Finally, visual inspection of imperviousness layer was made with limited manual editing to eliminate non-urban areas based on area of interest delineated by the mapping team.

This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 edition, amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of Imperviousness for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

No formal independent accuracy assessment for this product has been made. The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping protocols offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for imperviousness predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design. For each mapping zone, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs was computed. Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment. 87.6 The above listed value is the mean accuracy obtained for imperviousness data in cross-validation studies for all 66 MRLC Zones.

This NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness data product is the version dated October 10, 2014. N/A N/A The method employed to map percent developed imperviousness for NLCD 2001 consists of three key steps: deriving reference data of imperviousness from the high spatial resolution images, calibrating density prediction models using reference data and Landsat spectral bands, and extrapolating the developed models spatially to map per-pixel imperviousness. This method is described in detail in Yang et al. (2003). Unknown To develop adequate training data for impervious estimation, approximately 20 DOQQ's across each mapping zone with a nominal spatial resolution of 1-m were classified into either pervious or non-pervious surfaces, and then summed within each 30 meter Landsat pixel cell to obtain percentage of imperviousness. Training data were selected based on the degree of variance each training data set possesses with regards to Landsat ETM+ imagery used for mapping. Each added training data set decreased the amount of variance present within the Landsat data as a whole. The selection process was repeated until the amount of variance explained reached a pre-defined threshold. By combining the training data with Landsat spectral data and other ancillary data, percent imperviousness prediction models were developed using a regression tree algorithm (named 'Cubist'). All data layers used as input for running the Cubist, in order to establish the prediction model for imperviousness are listed in the 'Supplemental Information' section. Three ancillary data sets were used for urban/suburban delineation masking, which is essential to confine the imperviousness mapping within the developed areas. After the best combination of possible input data layers had been determined and the final percent impervious layer produced, the urban mask created was used to eliminate those pixels from the final percent impervious file that fall outside identified impervious surface areas. Thus, the impervious pixels identified within the mask were retained, while all non-impervious surface pixels were removed from the final product. This corrected for any small areas of pixels that may have been included as part of the impervious surface layer because their spectral signature was not covered in the Cubist modeling process. Finally, visual inspection of imperviousness layer was made with limited manual editing to eliminate non-urban areas based on area of interest delineated by the mapping team.

This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to parse imperviousness changes to the correct era. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 edition, amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of Imperviousness for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

No formal independent accuracy assessment for this product has been made. The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping protocols offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability. Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for imperviousness predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design. For each mapping zone, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size. For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples). This process was repeated 5 times. After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs was computed. Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment. 87.6 The above listed value is the mean accuracy obtained for imperviousness data in cross-validation studies for all 66 MRLC Zones.

54a195e3e4b0bb7b6f9a1a52.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium. The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Previously, NLCD consisted of three major data releases based on a 10-year cycle. These include a circa 1992 conterminous U.S. land cover dataset with one thematic layer (NLCD 1992), a circa 2001 50-state/Puerto Rico updated U.S. land cover database (NLCD 2001 2011 Edition) with three layers including thematic land cover, percent imperviousness, and percent tree canopy, and a 1992/2001 Land Cover Change Retrofit Product. With these national data layers, there is often a 5-year time lag between the image capture date and product release. In some areas, the land cover can undergo significant change during production time, resulting in products that may be perpetually out of date. To address these issues, this circa 2006 NLCD land cover product (NLCD 2006 2011 Edition) was conceived to meet user community needs for more frequent land cover monitoring (moving to a 5-year cycle) and to reduce the production time between image capture and product release. NLCD 2006 (2011 edition) is designed to provide the user both updated land cover data and additional information that can be used to identify the pattern, nature, and magnitude of changes occurring between 2001 (2011 Edition) and 2006 (2011 Edition) for the conterminous United States at medium spatial resolution. For NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition), there are 4 primary data products: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover (2011 Edition); 2) NLCD 2001/2006 Land Cover Change Pixels (2011 Edition) labeled with the 2006 land cover class; 3) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition), and 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (2011 Edition). In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2006 Path/Row Index vector file showing the footprint of Landsat scene pairs used to derive 2001/2006 spectral change with change pair acquisition dates included in the attribute table. As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 data products have been revised and reissued (2011 Edition) to provide full compatibility with all other NLCD 2011 Edition products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes. Land cover maps, derivatives and all associated documents are considered 'provisional' until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted. The NLCD 2006 is created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product. Questions about the NLCD 2006 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2006 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov."

54a195e3e4b0bb7b6f9a1a52.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Original NLCD 2006 processing is described in this process step. Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database NLCD 2006 (2011) Edition Processing Steps - To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2006 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a195e3e4b0bb7b6f9a1a52.xml,Resource Lineage,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Original NLCD 2006 processing is described in this process step. Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database NLCD 2006 (2011) Edition Processing Steps - To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2006 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

The U.S. Geological Survey can make no guarantee as to the accuracy or completeness of this information, and it is provided with the understanding that it is not guaranteed to be correct or complete. Conclusions drawn from this information are the responsibility of the user. The NLCD 2006 final seamless products include: 1) NLCD 2006 Land Cover map (2011 Edition); 2) NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (2011 Edition) ; 3) NLCD 2001/2006 Change Pixels (2011 Edition) labeled with the 2006 land cover class; and 4) NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (2011 Edition). This NLCD product is the version dated October 10, 2014. N/A N/A Original NLCD 2006 processing is described in this process step. Changes made to NLCD 2006 products to maintain compatibility and alignment with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition) and NLCD 2011 (2011 Edition) are described in the second process step. Original NLCD 2006 Processing - Landsat image selection and preprocessing. For the change analysis, a two-date pair of Landsat scenes was selected for each path/row restricting temporal range to reduce the impact of seasonal and phenological variation. A pre-processing step was performed to convert the digital number to top of atmosphere reflectance using procedures similar to those established for the NLCD 2001 mapping effort (Homer et al., 2004). Reflectance derivatives, including a tasseled-cap transformation and a 3-ratio index, were generated for each scene to use in the modeling process as independent variables. Where present, clouds and cloud shadows were digitized for masking. NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness (Final Product) and Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Analysis. Because the four NLCD developed classes are derived from a percent imperviousness mapping product, an overview of steps required to update the NLCD 2001 imperviousness to reflect urban growth captured in 2006 era Landsat imagery is provided here (Xian et al., 2010). First, 2001 nighttime lights imagery from the NOAA Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) was imposed on the NLCD 2001 impervious surface product to exclude low density imperviousness outside urban and suburban centers so that only imperviousness in urban core areas would be used in the training dataset. Two training datasets, one having a relatively larger urban extent and one having a smaller extent, were produced through imposing two different thresholds on city light imagery. Second, each of the two training datasets combined with 2001 Landsat imagery was separately applied using a regression tree (RT) algorithm to build up RT models. Two sets of RT models were then used to estimate percent imperviousness and to produce two 2001 synthetic impervious surfaces. Similarly, the same two training datasets were used with 2006 Landsat imagery to create two sets of RT models that produce two 2006 synthetic impervious surfaces. Third, the 2001 and 2006 synthetic impervious surface pairs were compared using both 2001 impervious surface products to retain 2001 impervious surface area (ISA) in the unchanged areas. The 2006 DMSP nighttime lights imagery was then employed to ensure that non-imperviousness areas were not included and that new impervious surfaces emerged in the city light extent. After this step, two 2006 intermediate impervious surfaces were produced. Finally, the two intermediate products and 2001 imperviousness were compared to remove false estimates in non-urban areas and generate a 2006 impervious surface estimate. Imperviousness threshold values used to derive the NLCD developed classes are: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%). During this process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. Land Cover Change Analysis. For the NLCD 2006 Land Cover Update, a new change detection method, Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA), was developed to capture a full range of land cover disturbance and potential land cover change patterns for updating the National Land Cover Database (Jin et al., 2013). Recognizing the potential complementary nature of multiple spectral indices in detection of different land cover changes, we integrated four indices into one model to more accurately detect true land cover changes between two time periods. Within the model, normalized burn ratio (NBR), change vector (CV, Xian et al., 2009), relative change vector (RCV), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are calculated separately for the early date (circa 2001) and late date (circa 2006) scenes. The four pairs of indices for the two dates are differenced and then evaluated in a final model conditional statement that categorizes each pixel as either biomass increase, biomass decrease, or no change. Individual path/row raw results from this change analysis process are assembled into a seamless national product to form the NLCD 2001/2006 Maximum Potential Change map. The integrated change result is clumped and sieved to produce a refined change/no-change mask used below. NLCD 2006 Land Cover Classification. Land cover mapping protocols used during NLCD 2006 processing are similar to those used to label the NLCD 2001 product (Homer et al., 2004), but applied on a path/row basis instead of multiple path/row MRLC zones (Xian et al., 2009). Classification was achieved using decision tree modeling that employed a combination of Landsat imagery, reflectance derivatives, and ancillary data (independent variables) with training data points (dependent variable) collected from a refined version of the NLCD 2001 land cover product. Training points were randomly sampled and limited to those areas that were determined to be unchanged between 2001 and 2006 during the MIICA spectral change analysis process. Training data for pixels changed to developed land cover were not collected since the four classes in urban and sub-urban areas were mapped separately using a regression tree modeling method (described in the Imperviousness Change Analysis process steps above). Post classification modeling and hand-editing were used to further refine the decision tree output. Following classification, the 2006 land cover was masked with the change/no-change result (captured during the MIICA change analysis modeling) to extract a label for spectrally changed pixels. Labeled change pixels were then compared to the NLCD 2001 land cover base to exclude those pixels identified as spectral change, but classified with the same label as the corresponding 2001 pixel. NLCD 2006 percent developed impervious pixels, identified as changed, were extracted to NLCD developed class codes using NLCD 2001 legend thresholds for developed classes and added to the change pixel map. This intermediate change pixel product was generalized using the NLCD Smart Eliminate tool with the following minimum mapping units (mmu) applied: 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m pixel patch) for developed classes (class codes 21, 22, 23, and 24); 7.12 acres (approximately 32 ETM+ pixel patch) for agricultural classes (class codes 81 and 82); and 2.67 acres (approximately 12 ETM+ pixel patch) for all other classes (class codes 11, 12, 31, 41, 42, 43, 52, 71, 90, and 95). The smart eliminate aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to the mmu pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible. During the NLCD 2006 analysis and modeling process, inconsistencies in the NLCD 2001 Land cover product were corrected with the new product, NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, included as part of the NLCD 2006 product release. NLCD 2006 Land Cover (Final Product). Additional processing steps were designed to create the final NLCD 2006 land cover map. Individual path/row change pixel results were assembled to form an intermediate seamless national product. This seamless change pixel map was reviewed and edited to remove regional inconsistencies. Refined NLCD 2006 change pixels were then combined with the re-issued NLCD 2001 Land Cover Version 2.0, and the resulting image was smart-eliminated to a 5-pixel mmu. This final step eliminated single pixels and patches less than 5 pixels in extent that appeared as a result of combining the separate images. NLCD 2006 Change Pixels (Final Product). A comparison of the NLCD 2001 re-issued base and the NLCD 2006 Land Cover was necessary to extract a final version of the NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. In a model, pixels that were labeled with the same land cover class code were removed and only those pixels that did not agree in the two classifications were retained as final NLCD 2006 Change Pixels. NLCD 2001/2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change (Supplementary Raster Layer). The NLCD 2001 Percent Developed Imperviousness Version 2.0 and the NLCD 2006 Percent Developed Imperviousness were compared in a model to provide the user community with a layer that highlights imperviousness change between 2001 and 2006.

Landsat ETM, Landsat TM, DEM, USGS/EROS Unknown USGS National Land Cover Database NLCD 2006 (2011) Edition Processing Steps - To improve NLCD imperviousness the 2011 project included a process to reduce omission and commission error in NLCD 2001, 2006, and 2011 products. This activity was completed for urban areas in most of the eastern ½ of the conterminous United States. High resolution (one-meter ground sample distance) National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP  http://fsa.usda.gov/FSA/) imagery was used to verify imperviousness. Using hand-edits imperviousness was removed from areas incorrectly identified as developed and added to areas where developed land cover was missed. A modeling process was implemented to add missed imperviousness changes to the correct era and to fill areas where developed was removed with an appropriate non-developed land cover class. These improvements were incorporated with the derived developed classes in all areas of imperviousness and land cover versions released with NLCD 2011 editions. Unknown Process Step for NLCD 2006 (amended 2014): The release in 2014 of amended versions of land cover for 2001, 2006, and 2011 was made to correct for unintended differences between the impervious dataset and the four land cover developed classes (Open Space, Low Intensity, Medium Intensity, and High Intensity). NLCD developed classes are tied directly to the impervious product values. However, the land cover product Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) is five pixels whereas the impervious product MMU is single pixel. This MMU difference creates problems when the impervious single pixel MMU product is directly crosswalked into the 5-pixel MMU land cover developed classes. The smoothing process, which generalizes the land cover product to a 5-pixel MMU, can create small areas which are no longer directly represented in the imperviousness product because they are artifacts of the smoothing. Since these changes are not real and not present in the impervious layer, the new version removes these artifacts and re-establishes the direct linkage between the imperviousness and land cover products for any developed area. Combined developed areas (all developed classes combined into a group) in the land cover product must still meet the 5-pixel MMU threshold; however, the four NLCD land cover individual developed classes within the group patch are now represented by a single pixel MMU to retain the direct linkage to the imperviousness product.

54a19635e4b0bb7b6f9a1a55.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The 2010 North American Land Cover data set was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each countrys specific requirements. The initial data set of North American Land Cover at 250 meters reflected land cover information for 2005. This 2010 data set was produced by updating the 2005 data to show land cover changes as determined from more recent data. No changes were mapped in Hawaii because newer data were not available. Land cover classification changed between 2005 and 2010 for approximately 1 percent of the continental area. For the continental data sets (including surrounding water fringe) 4150241 pixels (1.03% of the area) changed in the update. The following national counts exclude the water fringe: Canada, 3264779 pixels changed (2.05%); Mexico, 47070 pixels changed (0.15%), and U.S., 836706 pixels changed (0.55%). The initial data set used to generate land cover information over North America was produced by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing from observations acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra). All seven land spectral bands were processed from Level 1 granules into top-of-atmosphere reflectance covering North America at a 250-meter spatial and 10-day temporal resolution. In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by INEGI, CONABIO, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country used specific training data and land cover mapping methodologies to create national data sets. This North America data set was produced by combining the national land cover data sets. The countries worked together to produce a definitive list of land cover classifications for the 2005 data; the same classifications were used for the 2010 data. This document is available for download from the same site as the data and is entitled: North American Land Cover Classifications (2005)."

Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution. MOD02QKM MOD02HKM MOD03 2009 NA Monthly composites 2005 MODIS monthly composites for 2010 were produced using the same process as for the 2005 data, but with updated source material. MOD02QKM 2012 MOD02HKM 2012 MOD03 2012 2013 NA Monthly composites 2010 Version 2 of the 2005 Land Cover was used as the starting point for all three countries. Areas of potential change were identified and then reclassified as necessary. Country-specific processes are described in this process step and the ones below. Please see the points-of-contact if additional processing information is needed. For Canada, the 2010 land cover was derived from a time series of land cover, developed for Canada from 2000 to 2010 at an annual time step, using MODIS data as input (Pouliot et al., 2013). The method used to update land cover for each year in the time series followed a change- and evidence-based classification approach. It was applied separately for six mapping zones. Mapping zones were selected to have similar spectral and land cover properties that could be optimized within the zone so as to reduce class confusion. Change detection was a critical step, as the basic premise of the method required changes to be detected with high confidence. Three methods were used to capture different types of change and at different temporal scales. Annual negative change results were generated in previous research by Guindon et al. (2011), which mostly captured forest-stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting and fire. New methods were developed to capture annual positive change in disturbed areas and to account for subtle multi-year change of either a negative or positive nature. Negative change refers to vegetation loss and positive change to vegetation establishment and growth. In the context of multi-year change, examples of the negative case include recurrent insect defoliation, gradual urbanization, and persistent climatic or hydrological alteration. For the positive case, examples include gradual regeneration of disturbed areas and climate-related vegetation change. To predict the new land cover label for a change area, several sources of evidence were combined including the class membership output from a decision tree classifier, class temporal transition likelihood, and regional and neighbourhood class proportions. The class with the maximum combined evidence was taken as the updated land cover label. A base land cover map for 2005 was used for the update and served as the classification training data source. To capture class temporal variability, training samples were taken for pixels that had not changed within plus or minus 1 year of the base map. Temporal filtering of the time series was the final step applied to remove highly improbable land cover transitions once all maps in the time series were processed. Several sources of ancillary data were incorporated in the classification to develop or refine the initial base map. These included a 250-meter spatial resolution water fraction map assembled from the National Topographic Data Base at 1:2500000 scale (Palvic and Latifovic, 2007), digital elevation data at 1:50000 scale, Canada road network data at 1:250000 scale converted to road density within a 250 meter grid cell, and an indicator of the Taiga class likelihood based on proximity to the northern treeline (Timoney et al., 1992) and conifer class density measured within a 50x50 pixel window of the 2005 land cover base map. Exponentially decreasing membership functions were defined for the distance and density layers and multiplied to calculate the final Taiga likelihood estimate. LandCover2005_v2 NA Monthly Composites 2005 NA Monthly Composites 2010 Canada ancillary data 2013 CCRS_NLCD 2010 In Mexico, potential change estimation built on the monthly MODIS image composites of all seven spectral bands. Image data from 2010 were normalized to the corresponding band and month from 2005 using Theil-Sen regression (Olthof et al. 2005). Next, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. Based on the NDVI, textural Laplace and Sobel filters with 3x3 kernel size were applied to enhance change detection along land cover edges. In total a set of 120 data layers were used: data for 7 spectral bands, NDVI, Sobel, and Laplace filters (10 data layers), for 12 months of the year. This set of data layers was produced for both 2005 and 2010, and compared between the two subject years. A small difference in values between the 2005 and 2010 data indicates areas that have not changed, whereas extreme negative and positive values indicate changes. For areas of change, the most appropriate lower and upper cut-off thresholds in the difference image histogram (lower and upper quantile) must be determined, and also the frequency, i.e. number of times, out of the 120 data layers used for comparison, that a pixel should be flagged as changed. The appropriate threshold values for the lower quantile, upper quantile, and frequency were defined by training an algorithm using pairs of Landsat images from April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2005 and 2010, from which change was estimated by visual interpretation. The optimal thresholds were defined as: lower quantile, 1 percent; upper quantile, 99 percent; and frequency (the number of data layers indicating change), 30. The resulting change mask identified areas of potential change; errors remaining in the change mask were removed by manual editing. The mask was assessed with 10m SPOT 5 HRG images for nine sites; the overall accuracy was 80 percent, with a commission error rate of 20 percent and a omission error rate of 50 percent. Map updating employs the above-described change mask, the baseline version 2 land cover map from 2005, and spectral data from the year 2010. Updating builds on the assumption that all pixels that were not identified as potential change will indicate no change between 2005 and 2010. For each class, 1,500 samples were selected from unchanged areas within 1-2 km of potential areas of change; those samples were used to train the decision tree model which was then applied to classify areas of change within the potential change mask area for the year 2010.

Included in the model were burn areas from MTBS, with an effort made to model burn severity and potential recovery. Only fires from 2010 and earlier were considered in the modeling. Areas of potential change were classified through a process similar to that used to classify the 2005 data, using a combination of MODIS composite imagery and ancillary data. Adjustments to the model were made based on experience gained in producing the 2005 Version 2 data set. Classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT). The specific DT program employed is called SEE5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). SEE5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, SEE5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. The change pixels represent a conservative estimate of change based on both spectral analysis and thematic change between land cover modeled for both 2005 and 2010.  Much of the change is in fire perimeter areas.  Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Alaska was processed separately from the conterminous United States, using DEM, SRTM,   and CADEM. The conterminous United States was processed using DEM elevation data.  Hawaii was not updated because newer data were not available. The resulting data set was checked against Landsat MRLC for quality assurance.

Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution. MOD02QKM MOD02HKM MOD03 2009 NA Monthly composites 2005 MODIS monthly composites for 2010 were produced using the same process as for the 2005 data, but with updated source material. MOD02QKM 2012 MOD02HKM 2012 MOD03 2012 2013 NA Monthly composites 2010 Version 2 of the 2005 Land Cover was used as the starting point for all three countries. Areas of potential change were identified and then reclassified as necessary. Country-specific processes are described in this process step and the ones below. Please see the points-of-contact if additional processing information is needed. For Canada, the 2010 land cover was derived from a time series of land cover, developed for Canada from 2000 to 2010 at an annual time step, using MODIS data as input (Pouliot et al., 2013). The method used to update land cover for each year in the time series followed a change- and evidence-based classification approach. It was applied separately for six mapping zones. Mapping zones were selected to have similar spectral and land cover properties that could be optimized within the zone so as to reduce class confusion. Change detection was a critical step, as the basic premise of the method required changes to be detected with high confidence. Three methods were used to capture different types of change and at different temporal scales. Annual negative change results were generated in previous research by Guindon et al. (2011), which mostly captured forest-stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting and fire. New methods were developed to capture annual positive change in disturbed areas and to account for subtle multi-year change of either a negative or positive nature. Negative change refers to vegetation loss and positive change to vegetation establishment and growth. In the context of multi-year change, examples of the negative case include recurrent insect defoliation, gradual urbanization, and persistent climatic or hydrological alteration. For the positive case, examples include gradual regeneration of disturbed areas and climate-related vegetation change. To predict the new land cover label for a change area, several sources of evidence were combined including the class membership output from a decision tree classifier, class temporal transition likelihood, and regional and neighbourhood class proportions. The class with the maximum combined evidence was taken as the updated land cover label. A base land cover map for 2005 was used for the update and served as the classification training data source. To capture class temporal variability, training samples were taken for pixels that had not changed within plus or minus 1 year of the base map. Temporal filtering of the time series was the final step applied to remove highly improbable land cover transitions once all maps in the time series were processed. Several sources of ancillary data were incorporated in the classification to develop or refine the initial base map. These included a 250-meter spatial resolution water fraction map assembled from the National Topographic Data Base at 1:2500000 scale (Palvic and Latifovic, 2007), digital elevation data at 1:50000 scale, Canada road network data at 1:250000 scale converted to road density within a 250 meter grid cell, and an indicator of the Taiga class likelihood based on proximity to the northern treeline (Timoney et al., 1992) and conifer class density measured within a 50x50 pixel window of the 2005 land cover base map. Exponentially decreasing membership functions were defined for the distance and density layers and multiplied to calculate the final Taiga likelihood estimate. LandCover2005_v2 NA Monthly Composites 2005 NA Monthly Composites 2010 Canada ancillary data 2013 CCRS_NLCD 2010 In Mexico, potential change estimation built on the monthly MODIS image composites of all seven spectral bands. Image data from 2010 were normalized to the corresponding band and month from 2005 using Theil-Sen regression (Olthof et al. 2005). Next, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. Based on the NDVI, textural Laplace and Sobel filters with 3x3 kernel size were applied to enhance change detection along land cover edges. In total a set of 120 data layers were used: data for 7 spectral bands, NDVI, Sobel, and Laplace filters (10 data layers), for 12 months of the year. This set of data layers was produced for both 2005 and 2010, and compared between the two subject years. A small difference in values between the 2005 and 2010 data indicates areas that have not changed, whereas extreme negative and positive values indicate changes. For areas of change, the most appropriate lower and upper cut-off thresholds in the difference image histogram (lower and upper quantile) must be determined, and also the frequency, i.e. number of times, out of the 120 data layers used for comparison, that a pixel should be flagged as changed. The appropriate threshold values for the lower quantile, upper quantile, and frequency were defined by training an algorithm using pairs of Landsat images from April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2005 and 2010, from which change was estimated by visual interpretation. The optimal thresholds were defined as: lower quantile, 1 percent; upper quantile, 99 percent; and frequency (the number of data layers indicating change), 30. The resulting change mask identified areas of potential change; errors remaining in the change mask were removed by manual editing. The mask was assessed with 10m SPOT 5 HRG images for nine sites; the overall accuracy was 80 percent, with a commission error rate of 20 percent and a omission error rate of 50 percent. Map updating employs the above-described change mask, the baseline version 2 land cover map from 2005, and spectral data from the year 2010. Updating builds on the assumption that all pixels that were not identified as potential change will indicate no change between 2005 and 2010. For each class, 1,500 samples were selected from unchanged areas within 1-2 km of potential areas of change; those samples were used to train the decision tree model which was then applied to classify areas of change within the potential change mask area for the year 2010.

Included in the model were burn areas from MTBS, with an effort made to model burn severity and potential recovery. Only fires from 2010 and earlier were considered in the modeling. Areas of potential change were classified through a process similar to that used to classify the 2005 data, using a combination of MODIS composite imagery and ancillary data. Adjustments to the model were made based on experience gained in producing the 2005 Version 2 data set. Classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT). The specific DT program employed is called SEE5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). SEE5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, SEE5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. The change pixels represent a conservative estimate of change based on both spectral analysis and thematic change between land cover modeled for both 2005 and 2010.  Much of the change is in fire perimeter areas.  Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Alaska was processed separately from the conterminous United States, using DEM, SRTM,   and CADEM. The conterminous United States was processed using DEM elevation data.  Hawaii was not updated because newer data were not available. The resulting data set was checked against Landsat MRLC for quality assurance.

Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution. MOD02QKM MOD02HKM MOD03 2009 NA Monthly composites 2005 MODIS monthly composites for 2010 were produced using the same process as for the 2005 data, but with updated source material. MOD02QKM 2012 MOD02HKM 2012 MOD03 2012 2013 NA Monthly composites 2010 Version 2 of the 2005 Land Cover was used as the starting point for all three countries. Areas of potential change were identified and then reclassified as necessary. Country-specific processes are described in this process step and the ones below. Please see the points-of-contact if additional processing information is needed. For Canada, the 2010 land cover was derived from a time series of land cover, developed for Canada from 2000 to 2010 at an annual time step, using MODIS data as input (Pouliot et al., 2013). The method used to update land cover for each year in the time series followed a change- and evidence-based classification approach. It was applied separately for six mapping zones. Mapping zones were selected to have similar spectral and land cover properties that could be optimized within the zone so as to reduce class confusion. Change detection was a critical step, as the basic premise of the method required changes to be detected with high confidence. Three methods were used to capture different types of change and at different temporal scales. Annual negative change results were generated in previous research by Guindon et al. (2011), which mostly captured forest-stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting and fire. New methods were developed to capture annual positive change in disturbed areas and to account for subtle multi-year change of either a negative or positive nature. Negative change refers to vegetation loss and positive change to vegetation establishment and growth. In the context of multi-year change, examples of the negative case include recurrent insect defoliation, gradual urbanization, and persistent climatic or hydrological alteration. For the positive case, examples include gradual regeneration of disturbed areas and climate-related vegetation change. To predict the new land cover label for a change area, several sources of evidence were combined including the class membership output from a decision tree classifier, class temporal transition likelihood, and regional and neighbourhood class proportions. The class with the maximum combined evidence was taken as the updated land cover label. A base land cover map for 2005 was used for the update and served as the classification training data source. To capture class temporal variability, training samples were taken for pixels that had not changed within plus or minus 1 year of the base map. Temporal filtering of the time series was the final step applied to remove highly improbable land cover transitions once all maps in the time series were processed. Several sources of ancillary data were incorporated in the classification to develop or refine the initial base map. These included a 250-meter spatial resolution water fraction map assembled from the National Topographic Data Base at 1:2500000 scale (Palvic and Latifovic, 2007), digital elevation data at 1:50000 scale, Canada road network data at 1:250000 scale converted to road density within a 250 meter grid cell, and an indicator of the Taiga class likelihood based on proximity to the northern treeline (Timoney et al., 1992) and conifer class density measured within a 50x50 pixel window of the 2005 land cover base map. Exponentially decreasing membership functions were defined for the distance and density layers and multiplied to calculate the final Taiga likelihood estimate. LandCover2005_v2 NA Monthly Composites 2005 NA Monthly Composites 2010 Canada ancillary data 2013 CCRS_NLCD 2010 In Mexico, potential change estimation built on the monthly MODIS image composites of all seven spectral bands. Image data from 2010 were normalized to the corresponding band and month from 2005 using Theil-Sen regression (Olthof et al. 2005). Next, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. Based on the NDVI, textural Laplace and Sobel filters with 3x3 kernel size were applied to enhance change detection along land cover edges. In total a set of 120 data layers were used: data for 7 spectral bands, NDVI, Sobel, and Laplace filters (10 data layers), for 12 months of the year. This set of data layers was produced for both 2005 and 2010, and compared between the two subject years. A small difference in values between the 2005 and 2010 data indicates areas that have not changed, whereas extreme negative and positive values indicate changes. For areas of change, the most appropriate lower and upper cut-off thresholds in the difference image histogram (lower and upper quantile) must be determined, and also the frequency, i.e. number of times, out of the 120 data layers used for comparison, that a pixel should be flagged as changed. The appropriate threshold values for the lower quantile, upper quantile, and frequency were defined by training an algorithm using pairs of Landsat images from April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2005 and 2010, from which change was estimated by visual interpretation. The optimal thresholds were defined as: lower quantile, 1 percent; upper quantile, 99 percent; and frequency (the number of data layers indicating change), 30. The resulting change mask identified areas of potential change; errors remaining in the change mask were removed by manual editing. The mask was assessed with 10m SPOT 5 HRG images for nine sites; the overall accuracy was 80 percent, with a commission error rate of 20 percent and a omission error rate of 50 percent. Map updating employs the above-described change mask, the baseline version 2 land cover map from 2005, and spectral data from the year 2010. Updating builds on the assumption that all pixels that were not identified as potential change will indicate no change between 2005 and 2010. For each class, 1,500 samples were selected from unchanged areas within 1-2 km of potential areas of change; those samples were used to train the decision tree model which was then applied to classify areas of change within the potential change mask area for the year 2010.

Included in the model were burn areas from MTBS, with an effort made to model burn severity and potential recovery. Only fires from 2010 and earlier were considered in the modeling. Areas of potential change were classified through a process similar to that used to classify the 2005 data, using a combination of MODIS composite imagery and ancillary data. Adjustments to the model were made based on experience gained in producing the 2005 Version 2 data set. Classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT). The specific DT program employed is called SEE5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). SEE5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, SEE5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. The change pixels represent a conservative estimate of change based on both spectral analysis and thematic change between land cover modeled for both 2005 and 2010.  Much of the change is in fire perimeter areas.  Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Alaska was processed separately from the conterminous United States, using DEM, SRTM,   and CADEM. The conterminous United States was processed using DEM elevation data.  Hawaii was not updated because newer data were not available. The resulting data set was checked against Landsat MRLC for quality assurance.

Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution.

Areas of potential change were identified and then reclassified as necessary. Country-specific processes are described in this process step and the ones below. Please see the points-of-contact if additional processing information is needed. For Canada, the 2010 land cover was derived from a time series of land cover, developed for Canada from 2000 to 2010 at an annual time step, using MODIS data as input (Pouliot et al., 2013). The method used to update land cover for each year in the time series followed a change- and evidence-based classification approach. It was applied separately for six mapping zones. Mapping zones were selected to have similar spectral and land cover properties that could be optimized within the zone so as to reduce class confusion. Change detection was a critical step, as the basic premise of the method required changes to be detected with high confidence. Three methods were used to capture different types of change and at different temporal scales. Annual negative change results were generated in previous research by Guindon et al. (2011), which mostly captured forest-stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting and fire. New methods were developed to capture annual positive change in disturbed areas and to account for subtle multi-year change of either a negative or positive nature. Negative change refers to vegetation loss and positive change to vegetation establishment and growth. In the context of multi-year change, examples of the negative case include recurrent insect defoliation, gradual urbanization, and persistent climatic or hydrological alteration. For the positive case, examples include gradual regeneration of disturbed areas and climate-related vegetation change. To predict the new land cover label for a change area, several sources of evidence were combined including the class membership output from a decision tree classifier, class temporal transition likelihood, and regional and neighbourhood class proportions. The class with the maximum combined evidence was taken as the updated land cover label. A base land cover map for 2005 was used for the update and served as the classification training data source. To capture class temporal variability, training samples were taken for pixels that had not changed within plus or minus 1 year of the base map. Temporal filtering of the time series was the final step applied to remove highly improbable land cover transitions once all maps in the time series were processed. Several sources of ancillary data were incorporated in the classification to develop or refine the initial base map. These included a 250-meter spatial resolution water fraction map assembled from the National Topographic Data Base at 1:2500000 scale (Palvic and Latifovic, 2007), digital elevation data at 1:50000 scale, Canada road network data at 1:250000 scale converted to road density within a 250 meter grid cell, and an indicator of the Taiga class likelihood based on proximity to the northern treeline (Timoney et al., 1992) and conifer class density measured within a 50x50 pixel window of the 2005 land cover base map. Exponentially decreasing membership functions were defined for the distance and density layers and multiplied to calculate the final Taiga likelihood estimate. LandCover2005_v2 NA Monthly Composites 2005 NA Monthly Composites 2010 Canada ancillary data 2013 CCRS_NLCD 2010 In Mexico, potential change estimation built on the monthly MODIS image composites of all seven spectral bands. Image data from 2010 were normalized to the corresponding band and month from 2005 using Theil-Sen regression (Olthof et al. 2005). Next, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated. Based on the NDVI, textural Laplace and Sobel filters with 3x3 kernel size were applied to enhance change detection along land cover edges. In total a set of 120 data layers were used: data for 7 spectral bands, NDVI, Sobel, and Laplace filters (10 data layers), for 12 months of the year. This set of data layers was produced for both 2005 and 2010, and compared between the two subject years. A small difference in values between the 2005 and 2010 data indicates areas that have not changed, whereas extreme negative and positive values indicate changes. For areas of change, the most appropriate lower and upper cut-off thresholds in the difference image histogram (lower and upper quantile) must be determined, and also the frequency, i.e. number of times, out of the 120 data layers used for comparison, that a pixel should be flagged as changed. The appropriate threshold values for the lower quantile, upper quantile, and frequency were defined by training an algorithm using pairs of Landsat images from April (the end of the dry season) and October (the end of the rainy season) for 2005 and 2010, from which change was estimated by visual interpretation. The optimal thresholds were defined as: lower quantile, 1 percent; upper quantile, 99 percent; and frequency (the number of data layers indicating change), 30. The resulting change mask identified areas of potential change; errors remaining in the change mask were removed by manual editing. The mask was assessed with 10m SPOT 5 HRG images for nine sites; the overall accuracy was 80 percent, with a commission error rate of 20 percent and a omission error rate of 50 percent. Map updating employs the above-described change mask, the baseline version 2 land cover map from 2005, and spectral data from the year 2010. Updating builds on the assumption that all pixels that were not identified as potential change will indicate no change between 2005 and 2010. For each class, 1,500 samples were selected from unchanged areas within 1-2 km of potential areas of change; those samples were used to train the decision tree model which was then applied to classify areas of change within the potential change mask area for the year 2010.

Included in the model were burn areas from MTBS, with an effort made to model burn severity and potential recovery. Only fires from 2010 and earlier were considered in the modeling. Areas of potential change were classified through a process similar to that used to classify the 2005 data, using a combination of MODIS composite imagery and ancillary data. Adjustments to the model were made based on experience gained in producing the 2005 Version 2 data set. Classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT). The specific DT program employed is called SEE5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). SEE5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, SEE5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. The change pixels represent a conservative estimate of change based on both spectral analysis and thematic change between land cover modeled for both 2005 and 2010.  Much of the change is in fire perimeter areas.  Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Alaska was processed separately from the conterminous United States, using DEM, SRTM,   and CADEM. The conterminous United States was processed using DEM elevation data.  Hawaii was not updated because newer data were not available. The resulting data set was checked against Landsat MRLC for quality assurance.

The mask was assessed with 10m SPOT 5 HRG images for nine sites; the overall accuracy was 80 percent, with a commission error rate of 20 percent and a omission error rate of 50 percent. Map updating employs the above-described change mask, the baseline version 2 land cover map from 2005, and spectral data from the year 2010. Updating builds on the assumption that all pixels that were not identified as potential change will indicate no change between 2005 and 2010. For each class, 1,500 samples were selected from unchanged areas within 1-2 km of potential areas of change; those samples were used to train the decision tree model which was then applied to classify areas of change within the potential change mask area for the year 2010."
54a19635e4b0bb7b6f9a1a55.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"In the United States, land cover for 2010 was mapped by first running a spectral change analysis model to identify areas that potentially had changed between 2005 and 2010. Included in the model were burn areas from MTBS, with an effort made to model burn severity and potential recovery. Only fires from 2010 and earlier were considered in the modeling. Areas of potential change were classified through a process similar to that used to classify the 2005 data, using a combination of MODIS composite imagery and ancillary data. Adjustments to the model were made based on experience gained in producing the 2005 Version 2 data set. Classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT). The specific DT program employed is called SEE5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). SEE5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, SEE5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. The change pixels represent a conservative estimate of change based on both spectral analysis and thematic change between land cover modeled for both 2005 and 2010.  Much of the change is in fire perimeter areas.  Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Alaska was processed separately from the conterminous United States, using DEM, SRTM,   and CADEM. The conterminous United States was processed using DEM elevation data.  Hawaii was not updated because newer data were not available. The resulting data set was checked against Landsat MRLC for quality assurance."

Following the release of the first 2005 land cover data, several errors were identified in the data, including both errors in labeling and misinterpretation of thematic classes. To correct the labeling errors, each country focused on its national territory and corrected the errors which it considered most critical or misleading. For the continental data sets (including surrounding water fringe) 17440830 pixels (4.33% of the area) changed in the update. The following national counts exclude the water fringe: Canada, 10223412 pixels changed (6.44%); Mexico, 141142 pixels changed (0.45%), and U.S., 6878656 pixels changed (4.54%). The countries worked together to produce a definitive list of land cover classifications for the 2005 data; this document is available for download from the same site as the data and is entitled: North American Land Cover Classifications (2005). Version 1 of the 2005 North American Land Cover data set was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad) and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each countrys specific requirements. The data set of 2005 Land Cover of North America at a resolution of 250 meters is the first step toward this goal. The initial data set used to generate land cover information over North America was produced by the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing from observations acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Terra). All seven land spectral bands were processed from Level 1 granules into top-of-atmosphere reflectance covering North America at a 250-meter spatial and 10-day temporal resolution. In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by INEGI, CONABIO, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country used specific training data and land cover mapping methodologies to create national data sets. This North America data set was produced by combining the national land cover data sets."

A series of monthly MODIS composites were produced prior to the compilation of land cover data for each country. Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution. MOD02QKM MOD02HKM MOD03 2009 NA Monthly composites Canadian land cover was generated following the procedure described in Latifovic et al. (2004) which combines the Enhanced Classification Method (ECM, Beaubien et al., 1999) and Classification by Progressive Generalization (CPG, Cihlar et al., 1998 and Latifovic et al., 1999). The principal characteristic of this classification approach is the preservation of image information and incorporation of human contextual reasoning for land cover labeling. It includes the following generalization steps: 1) initial clustering, 2) cluster agglomeration based on spectral similarity and cluster size , 3) cluster agglomeration based on thematic similarity, and 4) cluster labeling. Initial clusters were generated using the K-mean classifier with bands 1, 2, and 6 from a 2005 summer composite created by averaging composites for July and August. Several ancillary GIS layers and other land cover products over regions of Canada were consulted to refine and improve land cover labeling. NA Monthly Composites Canada ancillary data 2009 CCRS_NLCD For Mexico, the monthly composites of MODIS-Terra top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) surface radiance data for the first seven spectral bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were employed for the land cover classification process. For each spectral band and the NDVI, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range between minimum and maximum were computed over the year, half-year, four-month, and quarter-year periods. This resulted in 400 metrics derived from MODIS data. In addition, ancillary data were employed including a digital elevation model and derivatives such as slope and aspect, mean, maximum and minimum temperature; total of precipitation and days with precipitation; and the number of green days. Sample data were derived from various sources, including data of the Mexican Forest Inventory, detailed cropland data, urban cover, and additional digitized points from reference sources; 20% of the samples were exclusively used for validation. The land cover type identification was achieved using a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). C5.0 classification trees were generated for the training data. Because exclusively continuous variables were employed, the tree only contains binary splits. Boosting with ten iterations was employed. The trees were applied to the data and the confidences were computed which were used as weights for combining the individual classifications. Several classifications were generated based on combinations of 1) input data - monthly TOA reflectances, generated metrics and ancillary data; and 2) complete or subset data sets of training data. Visual and statistical assessments were carried out to obtain the final classification. A distance layer was generated based on an ecoregions map to combine results of the different classifications; only selected classifications were selected for regions where they performed better visually and statically. Finally, a water mask was superimposed; the mask was derived from the Mapa de Uso de Suelo y Vegetacion from INEGI. NA Monthly Composites Mexico ancillary data 2009 INEGI_NLCD United States classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data (DEM). The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. For North America mapping , training data were collected from several combined sources including NLCD 2001 land cover, GAP land cover, NOAA Coastal Change and Analysis land cover, LANDFIRE land cover and other data sources. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps (described in an unpublished technical document; see the USGS point of contact if additional information is needed) were required to complete the final land cover product. Finally, visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an 'area of interest' (AOI); subsequently, limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI. NA Monthly composites Landsat DEM 2009 USGS_NLCD To produce the seamless land cover map of North America, the three national land cover products (Canada, Mexico, USA) were edge matched along the borders using an object-oriented segmentation technique. Land cover regions that crossed borders were reclassified using the majority class segment. CCRS_NLCD USGS_NLCD INEGI_NLCD 2009 LandCover2005_v1 In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data there were three classes that were incorrectly classified in Mexico: urban, water, and cropland. Urban area misclassifications included both areas where the extent was overestimated (e.g. the state of Puebla) and areas where the extent was underestimated (mainly in northern Mexico.) Areas that were mis-estimated were assigned to the most appropriate land cover class by visual interpretation; Google Earth was used for verification and visual analysis. Most water misclassifications were underestimations. It was important to correct this problem to allow for accurate change detection between this and later data sets. The waterbodies were identified on MODIS imagery and both size and shape of the areas was corrected. In addition, waterbodies that were not previously mapped were digitized where appropriate. A few waterbodies were reduced in size or eliminated but this was rare. For waterbodies that experience fluctuating water levels due to seasonal rains or to water storage and release in artificial lakes, the highest water mark, as indicated by the post-rainy season image (October), was used to map the waterbody size and shape. There were two problems with the classification of cropland. First, the definition of the cropland class is very broad and includes extensive rangeland and extensive agriculture. Second, in the Gulf Coast region cropland is spatially overestimated, but because the actual spatial patterns cannot be mapped from MODIS images, correction is difficult. As a result, cropland classifications were not modified in the version 2. LandCover2005_v1 NA Monthly Composites Google Earth 2013 In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data, Alaska was not correctly aligned with the MODIS source data. A new version of the land cover for Alaska was produced to fix the alignment problem. The land cover was remodeled using properly aligned imagery and new training data for the model. Some small areas in the extreme north and south of Alaska were missing data and these areas were added from cross-walked 2001 NLCD data and the MODIS 2010 data (it was assumed that there were land cover changes in these areas between 2005 and 2010.) The land cover information for the conterminous United States was adjusted for more accurate classification. In particular, an effort was made to improve the mapping of areas affected by fire, using the MTBS data. Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Shrub areas in the southwestern U.S. which had the wrong Level II class (Class 8 instead of Class 7) were adjusted. LandCover2005_v1 NA Monthly composites DEM USGS_NLCD_2001 MTBS 2013 Since the development of the Version 1 data for Canada, further quality assessment and input from users suggested modifications in some areas. The original source data were re-analyzed; major changes included reduction of treed wetland along the western and eastern coasts, correction of water/shadow confusion in regions of complex terrain, correction of snow/water confusion in the far north, improved disturbance representation based on change detection (Guindon et al., 2011), improved forest mapping in the prairies region, some minor changes to urban areas, and some local improvements to wetland mapping.

A series of monthly MODIS composites were produced prior to the compilation of land cover data for each country. Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution. MOD02QKM MOD02HKM MOD03 2009 NA Monthly composites Canadian land cover was generated following the procedure described in Latifovic et al. (2004) which combines the Enhanced Classification Method (ECM, Beaubien et al., 1999) and Classification by Progressive Generalization (CPG, Cihlar et al., 1998 and Latifovic et al., 1999). The principal characteristic of this classification approach is the preservation of image information and incorporation of human contextual reasoning for land cover labeling. It includes the following generalization steps: 1) initial clustering, 2) cluster agglomeration based on spectral similarity and cluster size , 3) cluster agglomeration based on thematic similarity, and 4) cluster labeling. Initial clusters were generated using the K-mean classifier with bands 1, 2, and 6 from a 2005 summer composite created by averaging composites for July and August. Several ancillary GIS layers and other land cover products over regions of Canada were consulted to refine and improve land cover labeling. NA Monthly Composites Canada ancillary data 2009 CCRS_NLCD For Mexico, the monthly composites of MODIS-Terra top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) surface radiance data for the first seven spectral bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were employed for the land cover classification process. For each spectral band and the NDVI, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range between minimum and maximum were computed over the year, half-year, four-month, and quarter-year periods. This resulted in 400 metrics derived from MODIS data. In addition, ancillary data were employed including a digital elevation model and derivatives such as slope and aspect, mean, maximum and minimum temperature; total of precipitation and days with precipitation; and the number of green days. Sample data were derived from various sources, including data of the Mexican Forest Inventory, detailed cropland data, urban cover, and additional digitized points from reference sources; 20% of the samples were exclusively used for validation. The land cover type identification was achieved using a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). C5.0 classification trees were generated for the training data. Because exclusively continuous variables were employed, the tree only contains binary splits. Boosting with ten iterations was employed. The trees were applied to the data and the confidences were computed which were used as weights for combining the individual classifications. Several classifications were generated based on combinations of 1) input data - monthly TOA reflectances, generated metrics and ancillary data; and 2) complete or subset data sets of training data. Visual and statistical assessments were carried out to obtain the final classification. A distance layer was generated based on an ecoregions map to combine results of the different classifications; only selected classifications were selected for regions where they performed better visually and statically. Finally, a water mask was superimposed; the mask was derived from the Mapa de Uso de Suelo y Vegetacion from INEGI. NA Monthly Composites Mexico ancillary data 2009 INEGI_NLCD United States classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data (DEM). The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. For North America mapping , training data were collected from several combined sources including NLCD 2001 land cover, GAP land cover, NOAA Coastal Change and Analysis land cover, LANDFIRE land cover and other data sources. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps (described in an unpublished technical document; see the USGS point of contact if additional information is needed) were required to complete the final land cover product. Finally, visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an 'area of interest' (AOI); subsequently, limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI. NA Monthly composites Landsat DEM 2009 USGS_NLCD To produce the seamless land cover map of North America, the three national land cover products (Canada, Mexico, USA) were edge matched along the borders using an object-oriented segmentation technique. Land cover regions that crossed borders were reclassified using the majority class segment. CCRS_NLCD USGS_NLCD INEGI_NLCD 2009 LandCover2005_v1 In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data there were three classes that were incorrectly classified in Mexico: urban, water, and cropland. Urban area misclassifications included both areas where the extent was overestimated (e.g. the state of Puebla) and areas where the extent was underestimated (mainly in northern Mexico.) Areas that were mis-estimated were assigned to the most appropriate land cover class by visual interpretation; Google Earth was used for verification and visual analysis. Most water misclassifications were underestimations. It was important to correct this problem to allow for accurate change detection between this and later data sets. The waterbodies were identified on MODIS imagery and both size and shape of the areas was corrected. In addition, waterbodies that were not previously mapped were digitized where appropriate. A few waterbodies were reduced in size or eliminated but this was rare. For waterbodies that experience fluctuating water levels due to seasonal rains or to water storage and release in artificial lakes, the highest water mark, as indicated by the post-rainy season image (October), was used to map the waterbody size and shape. There were two problems with the classification of cropland. First, the definition of the cropland class is very broad and includes extensive rangeland and extensive agriculture. Second, in the Gulf Coast region cropland is spatially overestimated, but because the actual spatial patterns cannot be mapped from MODIS images, correction is difficult. As a result, cropland classifications were not modified in the version 2. LandCover2005_v1 NA Monthly Composites Google Earth 2013 In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data, Alaska was not correctly aligned with the MODIS source data. A new version of the land cover for Alaska was produced to fix the alignment problem. The land cover was remodeled using properly aligned imagery and new training data for the model. Some small areas in the extreme north and south of Alaska were missing data and these areas were added from cross-walked 2001 NLCD data and the MODIS 2010 data (it was assumed that there were land cover changes in these areas between 2005 and 2010.) The land cover information for the conterminous United States was adjusted for more accurate classification. In particular, an effort was made to improve the mapping of areas affected by fire, using the MTBS data. Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Shrub areas in the southwestern U.S. which had the wrong Level II class (Class 8 instead of Class 7) were adjusted. LandCover2005_v1 NA Monthly composites DEM USGS_NLCD_2001 MTBS 2013 Since the development of the Version 1 data for Canada, further quality assessment and input from users suggested modifications in some areas. The original source data were re-analyzed; major changes included reduction of treed wetland along the western and eastern coasts, correction of water/shadow confusion in regions of complex terrain, correction of snow/water confusion in the far north, improved disturbance representation based on change detection (Guindon et al., 2011), improved forest mapping in the prairies region, some minor changes to urban areas, and some local improvements to wetland mapping.

54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Quality Statement,/metadata/dataqual,"Canada: An accuracy assessment was performed on the Canadian data at the 12-class IGBP level. To assist in tree life-form identification where crown shape was difficult to interpret, reference data were obtained through visual assessment of high- resolution image data in Google Earth, supported by Landsat data. Within the high- resolution imagery, random sampling was used to generate 838 reference samples. Each sample was interpreted and assigned a primary label, a secondary label and a confidence level. The primary label referred to the most likely class assigned to a pixel according to the interpreter, while the secondary label referred to a second class that could also be considered acceptable in cases where ambiguity existed in the interpretation or where more than one label could be deemed correct. Examples of the latter occurred mainly along transition zones where two classes occurred almost equally within a 250m pixel. The confidence level was assigned based on the ease with which the land cover was visually interpreted and on the number of classes present in the 250m pixel. A high confidence was assigned to pixels where the high-resolution Google Earth image was acquired at an appropriate time of year for the class in question (for example, summer to fall for deciduous), and where one class clearly dominated the land cover within the pixel. For the primary label only, overall accuracy was nearly 59% with a Kappa of 0.54. Overall accuracy increased to 69% and the Kappa increased to 0.65 when considering either the primary or secondary label as being correct. For primary labels interpreted with high confidence, representing 365 of 838 reference samples, overall accuracy increased again to 75% with a Kappa of 0.72. The increase in classification accuracy with high reference-data interpretation confidence was a function of greater land cover homogeneity within the reference data footprint and less ambiguity largely due to reference image quality. The analysis of the classification error matrix revealed known sources of spectral confusion among land cover classes. Adjacent forest classes tended to be confused, as well as deciduous forest, shrubland, shrub-covered wetlands, and certain croplands. These classes were difficult to separate with spectral data alone, due to all classes being primary broadleaved deciduous and the known radiometric saturation at leaf area index levels in the range of 3-5, which was achieved in all three classes. Other issues arose with the herbaceous class, which was either conifer (according to reference data along the treeline) consisting of open treed areas with herbaceous understory, or low biomass croplands. Confusion between herb, shrub, and deciduous was also due to relatively small disturbance patch sizes of cuts, primarily in British Columbia, and the point-spread function of the sensor, leading to reduced detection of objects smaller than seven pixels. Finally, the lichen/moss class was either herbaceous or wetland according to the reference data, due to the prevalence of both lichen and moss in certain wetlands and the low biomass of both the lichen/moss and herbaceous classes. A theoretical analysis of accuracy assessment of global land cover products over Canada in Latifovic and Olthof (2004) examined accuracy as a function of land cover homogeneity and thematic resolution. Based on land cover homogeneity in Canada, determined from a representative sample of medium resolution (~30m) land cover products, it was determined that a theoretical accuracy of 70-75% at a 16-land- cover-class thematic level should be achievable depending on the degree of labeling error. Accuracy for the 2005 Canadian land cover data is slightly lower when considering only the primary reference label and is in the 70% range when considering the primary or secondary label. This lower-than-theoretically- achievable accuracy is due to errors in the reference data labels as is evident from the increase in accuracy when both labels are considered. When labeling error is reduced further by considering only reference data that were interpreted with 100% confidence, the accuracy climbs to 75%. While this is on the upper range of the theoretically achievable accuracy, indicating minimal to no labeling error, it should be noted that the current assessment was done at a 12-class thematic level, which should increase the achievable accuracy and suggests that some labeling error is still present in the data set. Mexico: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed on the Mexican data, however, land cover proportions and distributions agree well with independent land cover and land use estimations of the Mapa de Vegetación y Uso de Suelo, Serie III of 2007 by INEGI. USA: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed for data products in the United States and this land cover data set should be considered provisional until a formal accuracy assessment is conducted.   During processing, the regression tree algorithm employed for land cover classification offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability.  Cross-validation provides relatively reliable estimates for land cover model performance if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design.  The cross-validation values for each zone were used to guide refinements to model training data and to improve classification results.  The quantitative value reported describes an average cross-validation value across several mapped zones and is not implied as a formal indicator of product accuracy. 70 The above listed value is the overall accuracy obtained for the Canada land cover data using the reference data set. 69 For the United States: Informal accuracy indicator based on average values of cross-validation reports from a regression tree algorithm. 85 The above listed value is the overall accuracy obtained for the Mexican land cover data using a subset of 20% of the training samples from the decision tree model. No tests for logical consistency have been performed on this data set. Data completeness reflects the content of the original MODIS data.

In particular, an effort was made to improve the mapping of areas affected by fire, using the MTBS data. Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Shrub areas in the southwestern U.S. which had the wrong Level II class (Class 8 instead of Class 7) were adjusted.

54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Resource Quality Description,/metadata/dataqual,"Canada: An accuracy assessment was performed on the Canadian data at the 12-class IGBP level. To assist in tree life-form identification where crown shape was difficult to interpret, reference data were obtained through visual assessment of high- resolution image data in Google Earth, supported by Landsat data. Within the high- resolution imagery, random sampling was used to generate 838 reference samples. Each sample was interpreted and assigned a primary label, a secondary label and a confidence level. The primary label referred to the most likely class assigned to a pixel according to the interpreter, while the secondary label referred to a second class that could also be considered acceptable in cases where ambiguity existed in the interpretation or where more than one label could be deemed correct. Examples of the latter occurred mainly along transition zones where two classes occurred almost equally within a 250m pixel. The confidence level was assigned based on the ease with which the land cover was visually interpreted and on the number of classes present in the 250m pixel. A high confidence was assigned to pixels where the high-resolution Google Earth image was acquired at an appropriate time of year for the class in question (for example, summer to fall for deciduous), and where one class clearly dominated the land cover within the pixel. For the primary label only, overall accuracy was nearly 59% with a Kappa of 0.54. Overall accuracy increased to 69% and the Kappa increased to 0.65 when considering either the primary or secondary label as being correct. For primary labels interpreted with high confidence, representing 365 of 838 reference samples, overall accuracy increased again to 75% with a Kappa of 0.72. The increase in classification accuracy with high reference-data interpretation confidence was a function of greater land cover homogeneity within the reference data footprint and less ambiguity largely due to reference image quality. The analysis of the classification error matrix revealed known sources of spectral confusion among land cover classes. Adjacent forest classes tended to be confused, as well as deciduous forest, shrubland, shrub-covered wetlands, and certain croplands. These classes were difficult to separate with spectral data alone, due to all classes being primary broadleaved deciduous and the known radiometric saturation at leaf area index levels in the range of 3-5, which was achieved in all three classes. Other issues arose with the herbaceous class, which was either conifer (according to reference data along the treeline) consisting of open treed areas with herbaceous understory, or low biomass croplands. Confusion between herb, shrub, and deciduous was also due to relatively small disturbance patch sizes of cuts, primarily in British Columbia, and the point-spread function of the sensor, leading to reduced detection of objects smaller than seven pixels. Finally, the lichen/moss class was either herbaceous or wetland according to the reference data, due to the prevalence of both lichen and moss in certain wetlands and the low biomass of both the lichen/moss and herbaceous classes. A theoretical analysis of accuracy assessment of global land cover products over Canada in Latifovic and Olthof (2004) examined accuracy as a function of land cover homogeneity and thematic resolution. Based on land cover homogeneity in Canada, determined from a representative sample of medium resolution (~30m) land cover products, it was determined that a theoretical accuracy of 70-75% at a 16-land- cover-class thematic level should be achievable depending on the degree of labeling error. Accuracy for the 2005 Canadian land cover data is slightly lower when considering only the primary reference label and is in the 70% range when considering the primary or secondary label. This lower-than-theoretically- achievable accuracy is due to errors in the reference data labels as is evident from the increase in accuracy when both labels are considered. When labeling error is reduced further by considering only reference data that were interpreted with 100% confidence, the accuracy climbs to 75%. While this is on the upper range of the theoretically achievable accuracy, indicating minimal to no labeling error, it should be noted that the current assessment was done at a 12-class thematic level, which should increase the achievable accuracy and suggests that some labeling error is still present in the data set. Mexico: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed on the Mexican data, however, land cover proportions and distributions agree well with independent land cover and land use estimations of the Mapa de Vegetación y Uso de Suelo, Serie III of 2007 by INEGI. USA: No formal accuracy assessment has been performed for data products in the United States and this land cover data set should be considered provisional until a formal accuracy assessment is conducted.   During processing, the regression tree algorithm employed for land cover classification offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability.  Cross-validation provides relatively reliable estimates for land cover model performance if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design.  The cross-validation values for each zone were used to guide refinements to model training data and to improve classification results.  The quantitative value reported describes an average cross-validation value across several mapped zones and is not implied as a formal indicator of product accuracy. 70 The above listed value is the overall accuracy obtained for the Canada land cover data using the reference data set. 69 For the United States: Informal accuracy indicator based on average values of cross-validation reports from a regression tree algorithm. 85 The above listed value is the overall accuracy obtained for the Mexican land cover data using a subset of 20% of the training samples from the decision tree model. No tests for logical consistency have been performed on this data set. Data completeness reflects the content of the original MODIS data.

A series of monthly MODIS composites were produced prior to the compilation of land cover data for each country. Input data used in land cover mapping were generated from the following original Level 1B MODIS data (collection 5): a) MOD02QKM - Level 1B 250m swath data, 5-min Granules; b) MOD02HKM - Level 1B 500m swath data, 5-min granules; c) MOD03  Level 1 Geolocation information, 1km swath data, 5-min granules. All input data are available from the NASA Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS), http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/ The MODIS 500m land channels (B3-B7) were downscaled to 250m spatial resolution as described by Trishchenko et al. (2006) and then re-projected into Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection using software developed at the CCRS (Khlopenkov et al., 2008). Two original 250m MODIS channels and five downscaled 250m MODIS land channels were assembled into North-America-wide 1 10-day composites following the methods developed in Luo et al., (2008). MODIS 10-day composites were further processed to reduce data noise due to different viewing conditions and remaining cloud and atmosphere contamination. A temporal rank filter was applied, calculated as the maximum of minimum values for two overlapping moving windows. For this implementation, a window size of three ten-day composites was used with one pixel overlap between windows. After rank filtering, a procedure to detect residual spikes in the data was applied based on a neighbourhood comparison. Within a moving window of 3 composites, if the neighbouring pixels were both above or below the centre pixel by 25%, the centre pixel was linearly interpolated from its neighbours. The filtered 10-day composites were averaged to generate monthly composites. The processed data set contained 12 monthly composites of channels 1 (B1, VIS) and 2 (B2, near-infrared NIR) at 250m spatial resolution and five channels designed for land applications (bands B3 to B7) resampled to 250m spatial resolution. MOD02QKM MOD02HKM MOD03 2009 NA Monthly composites Canadian land cover was generated following the procedure described in Latifovic et al. (2004) which combines the Enhanced Classification Method (ECM, Beaubien et al., 1999) and Classification by Progressive Generalization (CPG, Cihlar et al., 1998 and Latifovic et al., 1999). The principal characteristic of this classification approach is the preservation of image information and incorporation of human contextual reasoning for land cover labeling. It includes the following generalization steps: 1) initial clustering, 2) cluster agglomeration based on spectral similarity and cluster size , 3) cluster agglomeration based on thematic similarity, and 4) cluster labeling. Initial clusters were generated using the K-mean classifier with bands 1, 2, and 6 from a 2005 summer composite created by averaging composites for July and August. Several ancillary GIS layers and other land cover products over regions of Canada were consulted to refine and improve land cover labeling. NA Monthly Composites Canada ancillary data 2009 CCRS_NLCD For Mexico, the monthly composites of MODIS-Terra top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) surface radiance data for the first seven spectral bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were employed for the land cover classification process. For each spectral band and the NDVI, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range between minimum and maximum were computed over the year, half-year, four-month, and quarter-year periods. This resulted in 400 metrics derived from MODIS data. In addition, ancillary data were employed including a digital elevation model and derivatives such as slope and aspect, mean, maximum and minimum temperature; total of precipitation and days with precipitation; and the number of green days. Sample data were derived from various sources, including data of the Mexican Forest Inventory, detailed cropland data, urban cover, and additional digitized points from reference sources; 20% of the samples were exclusively used for validation. The land cover type identification was achieved using a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). C5.0 classification trees were generated for the training data. Because exclusively continuous variables were employed, the tree only contains binary splits. Boosting with ten iterations was employed. The trees were applied to the data and the confidences were computed which were used as weights for combining the individual classifications. Several classifications were generated based on combinations of 1) input data - monthly TOA reflectances, generated metrics and ancillary data; and 2) complete or subset data sets of training data. Visual and statistical assessments were carried out to obtain the final classification. A distance layer was generated based on an ecoregions map to combine results of the different classifications; only selected classifications were selected for regions where they performed better visually and statically. Finally, a water mask was superimposed; the mask was derived from the Mapa de Uso de Suelo y Vegetacion from INEGI. NA Monthly Composites Mexico ancillary data 2009 INEGI_NLCD United States classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data (DEM). The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. For North America mapping , training data were collected from several combined sources including NLCD 2001 land cover, GAP land cover, NOAA Coastal Change and Analysis land cover, LANDFIRE land cover and other data sources. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps (described in an unpublished technical document; see the USGS point of contact if additional information is needed) were required to complete the final land cover product. Finally, visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an 'area of interest' (AOI); subsequently, limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI. NA Monthly composites Landsat DEM 2009 USGS_NLCD To produce the seamless land cover map of North America, the three national land cover products (Canada, Mexico, USA) were edge matched along the borders using an object-oriented segmentation technique. Land cover regions that crossed borders were reclassified using the majority class segment. CCRS_NLCD USGS_NLCD INEGI_NLCD 2009 LandCover2005_v1 In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data there were three classes that were incorrectly classified in Mexico: urban, water, and cropland. Urban area misclassifications included both areas where the extent was overestimated (e.g. the state of Puebla) and areas where the extent was underestimated (mainly in northern Mexico.) Areas that were mis-estimated were assigned to the most appropriate land cover class by visual interpretation; Google Earth was used for verification and visual analysis. Most water misclassifications were underestimations. It was important to correct this problem to allow for accurate change detection between this and later data sets. The waterbodies were identified on MODIS imagery and both size and shape of the areas was corrected. In addition, waterbodies that were not previously mapped were digitized where appropriate. A few waterbodies were reduced in size or eliminated but this was rare. For waterbodies that experience fluctuating water levels due to seasonal rains or to water storage and release in artificial lakes, the highest water mark, as indicated by the post-rainy season image (October), was used to map the waterbody size and shape. There were two problems with the classification of cropland. First, the definition of the cropland class is very broad and includes extensive rangeland and extensive agriculture. Second, in the Gulf Coast region cropland is spatially overestimated, but because the actual spatial patterns cannot be mapped from MODIS images, correction is difficult. As a result, cropland classifications were not modified in the version 2. LandCover2005_v1 NA Monthly Composites Google Earth 2013 In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data, Alaska was not correctly aligned with the MODIS source data. A new version of the land cover for Alaska was produced to fix the alignment problem. The land cover was remodeled using properly aligned imagery and new training data for the model. Some small areas in the extreme north and south of Alaska were missing data and these areas were added from cross-walked 2001 NLCD data and the MODIS 2010 data (it was assumed that there were land cover changes in these areas between 2005 and 2010.) The land cover information for the conterminous United States was adjusted for more accurate classification. In particular, an effort was made to improve the mapping of areas affected by fire, using the MTBS data. Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Shrub areas in the southwestern U.S. which had the wrong Level II class (Class 8 instead of Class 7) were adjusted.

(2004) which combines the Enhanced Classification Method (ECM, Beaubien et al., 1999) and Classification by Progressive Generalization (CPG, Cihlar et al., 1998 and Latifovic et al., 1999). The principal characteristic of this classification approach is the preservation of image information and incorporation of human contextual reasoning for land cover labeling. It includes the following generalization steps: 1) initial clustering, 2) cluster agglomeration based on spectral similarity and cluster size , 3) cluster agglomeration based on thematic similarity, and 4) cluster labeling. Initial clusters were generated using the K-mean classifier with bands 1, 2, and 6 from a 2005 summer composite created by averaging composites for July and August. Several ancillary GIS layers and other land cover products over regions of Canada were consulted to refine and improve land cover labeling."
54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"For Mexico, the monthly composites of MODIS-Terra top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) surface radiance data for the first seven spectral bands and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were employed for the land cover classification process. For each spectral band and the NDVI, the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and range between minimum and maximum were computed over the year, half-year, four-month, and quarter-year periods. This resulted in 400 metrics derived from MODIS data. In addition, ancillary data were employed including a digital elevation model and derivatives such as slope and aspect, mean, maximum and minimum temperature; total of precipitation and days with precipitation; and the number of green days. Sample data were derived from various sources, including data of the Mexican Forest Inventory, detailed cropland data, urban cover, and additional digitized points from reference sources; 20% of the samples were exclusively used for validation. The land cover type identification was achieved using a Decision Tree Classifier (DTC). C5.0 classification trees were generated for the training data. Because exclusively continuous variables were employed, the tree only contains binary splits. Boosting with ten iterations was employed. The trees were applied to the data and the confidences were computed which were used as weights for combining the individual classifications. Several classifications were generated based on combinations of 1) input data - monthly TOA reflectances, generated metrics and ancillary data; and 2) complete or subset data sets of training data. Visual and statistical assessments were carried out to obtain the final classification. A distance layer was generated based on an ecoregions map to combine results of the different classifications; only selected classifications were selected for regions where they performed better visually and statically. Finally, a water mask was superimposed; the mask was derived from the Mapa de Uso de Suelo y Vegetacion from INEGI."
54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"United States classification was achieved by use of a classification and decision tree method (DT) using a combination of Landsat imagery and ancillary data (DEM). The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993). C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation. Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide a certain level of estimation regarding the land cover classification quality. In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system. To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data was required. For North America mapping , training data were collected from several combined sources including NLCD 2001 land cover, GAP land cover, NOAA Coastal Change and Analysis land cover, LANDFIRE land cover and other data sources. Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps (described in an unpublished technical document; see the USGS point of contact if additional information is needed) were required to complete the final land cover product. Finally, visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an 'area of interest' (AOI); subsequently, limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI."
54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"To produce the seamless land cover map of North America, the three national land cover products (Canada, Mexico, USA) were edge matched along the borders using an object-oriented segmentation technique. Land cover regions that crossed borders were reclassified using the majority class segment."
54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data there were three classes that were incorrectly classified in Mexico: urban, water, and cropland. Urban area misclassifications included both areas where the extent was overestimated (e.g. the state of Puebla) and areas where the extent was underestimated (mainly in northern Mexico.) Areas that were mis-estimated were assigned to the most appropriate land cover class by visual interpretation; Google Earth was used for verification and visual analysis. Most water misclassifications were underestimations. It was important to correct this problem to allow for accurate change detection between this and later data sets. The waterbodies were identified on MODIS imagery and both size and shape of the areas was corrected. In addition, waterbodies that were not previously mapped were digitized where appropriate. A few waterbodies were reduced in size or eliminated but this was rare. For waterbodies that experience fluctuating water levels due to seasonal rains or to water storage and release in artificial lakes, the highest water mark, as indicated by the post-rainy season image (October), was used to map the waterbody size and shape. There were two problems with the classification of cropland. First, the definition of the cropland class is very broad and includes extensive rangeland and extensive agriculture. Second, in the Gulf Coast region cropland is spatially overestimated, but because the actual spatial patterns cannot be mapped from MODIS images, correction is difficult. As a result, cropland classifications were not modified in the version 2."
54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"In Version 1 of the 2005 Land Cover data, Alaska was not correctly aligned with the MODIS source data. A new version of the land cover for Alaska was produced to fix the alignment problem. The land cover was remodeled using properly aligned imagery and new training data for the model. Some small areas in the extreme north and south of Alaska were missing data and these areas were added from cross-walked 2001 NLCD data and the MODIS 2010 data (it was assumed that there were land cover changes in these areas between 2005 and 2010.) The land cover information for the conterminous United States was adjusted for more accurate classification. In particular, an effort was made to improve the mapping of areas affected by fire, using the MTBS data. Burned areas were reclassified as necessary, based on the length of time since the fire occurred. Shrub areas in the southwestern U.S. which had the wrong Level II class (Class 8 instead of Class 7) were adjusted."
54a1964ee4b0bb7b6f9a1a5b.xml,Process Step Description,/metadata/dataqual/lineage/procstep/procdesc,"Since the development of the Version 1 data for Canada, further quality assessment and input from users suggested modifications in some areas. The original source data were re-analyzed; major changes included reduction of treed wetland along the western and eastern coasts, correction of water/shadow confusion in regions of complex terrain, correction of snow/water confusion in the far north, improved disturbance representation based on change detection (Guindon et al., 2011), improved forest mapping in the prairies region, some minor changes to urban areas, and some local improvements to wetland mapping."

The 2005-2010 Land Cover Change of North America at 250 meters was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries. The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each countrys specific requirements. This data set was created from the 2005 Land Cover of North America at 250 meters and the 2010 Land Cover of North America at 250 meters."

The continental scale land cover data generated under NALCMS can be used to address issues such as climate change, carbon sequestration, biodiversity loss, and changes in ecosystem structure and function, by helping users to better understand the dynamics and continental-scale patterns of North Americas changing environment. The North American Atlas data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national and continental level. These data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:10,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by Natural Resources Canada, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía, the U.S. Geological Survey, or the Commission for Environmental Cooperation in the use of these data."

54a309d5e4b038086b67501b.xml,Purpose,/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose,"Provide images of current conditions and prevalence of land cover types as a baseline for measuring future change, and to complement the existing grid-based sample photography of the region."
54a309d5e4b038086b67501b.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Field Oblique and nadir photographs and videos were shot along flight routes conducted July 16, 17, and 18, 2013, totaling 17 h 46 m flight time and 2,590 km flight distance, at a mean altitude of approximately 300 m above ground level. Flight routes were selected to provide a broad representation of land cover types within each unit and to overfly specific locations of recent disturbances. Photographs were geotagged;; all nadir photographs and videos were corrected for image lens distortion and appearance (increased gamma and color enhancement); all oblique photographs were corrected only for appearance; all oblique videos were neither geotagged nor corrected for appearance. Raw photographs were organized into folders, renamed by flight date and camera type. Unknown Extensively redundant or extraneous photographs were deleted, such as time-lapse images taken when the planes were stationary, long sequences when over deep water (e.g., over Kotzebue Sound), and other images with no usable content. Unknown Ensured that date and time in each photograph file’s EXIF (exchangeable image file format) data were accurate, as these data linked to the GPS waypoints for geotagging each photograph. Unknown Each photograph was adjusted for color saturation and gamma, which served to highlight many details. Unknown EXIF data from all photograph files -- including photograph file name and computer directory name, photograph date and time, camera type and settings, geotagged digital latitude and longitude, and altitude above mean sea level -- were extracted into spreadsheet files (.xlsx formats) by flight date and camera type. Unknown Each nadir photograph was corrected for lens distortion to adjust for their wide-angle (170d fisheye lens) distortion that occurred from the small focal lengths, and cropped to exclude blank portions of the image that occur after fisheye correction. Unknown The geolocation (latitude and longitude) of each nadir photograph from the was overlaid in GIS (ArcMap 10.0) onto a map of ecotypes of the ARCN region (Jorgenson et al. 2009). Presence and area of each ecotype within a square window centered on each photograph location were recorded and included in the EXIF spreadsheet files. Unknown The individual photograph geolocations were intersected in GIS with a digital elevation model (DEM) of the ARCN study area so that ground-level elevation could be determined for each photograph location. Then, the difference between flight altitude above mean sea level (determined enroute via the on-board GPS unit) and ground-level elevation gave flight elevation above ground level for all photographs, which was used to verify the mean flight elevation used in the calculations of photograph time-lapse intervals and areal coverage of each photograph.

Flight routes were selected to provide a broad representation of land cover types within each unit and to overfly specific locations of recent disturbances.

54a309d6e4b038086b67501f.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"Field Oblique and nadir photographs and videos were shot along flight routes conducted July 16, 17, and 18, 2013, totaling 17 h 46 m flight time and 2,590 km flight distance, at a mean altitude of approximately 300 m above ground level. Flight routes were selected to provide a broad representation of land cover types within each unit and to overfly specific locations of recent disturbances. Photographs were geotagged, and photographs and videos were corrected for image lens distortion and appearance. Raw photographs were organized into folders, renamed by flight date and camera type. Unknown Ensured that date and time in each photograph file’s EXIF (exchangeable image file format) data were accurate, as these data linked to the GPS waypoints for geotagging each photograph. Unknown Each photograph was adjusted for color saturation and gamma, which served to highlight many details. Unknown EXIF data from all photograph files -- including photograph file name and computer directory name, photograph date and time, camera type and settings, geotagged digital latitude and longitude, and altitude above mean sea level -- were extracted into spreadsheet files (.xlsx formats) by flight date and camera type. Unknown The individual photograph geolocations were intersected in GIS with a digital elevation model (DEM) of the ARCN study area so that ground-level elevation could be determined for each photograph location. Then, the difference between flight altitude above mean sea level (determined enroute via the on-board GPS unit) and ground-level elevation gave flight elevation above ground level for all photographs, which was used to verify the mean flight elevation used in the calculations of photograph time-lapse intervals and areal coverage of each photograph.

Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) quantifies these carbon fluxes, but current continental-scale estimates contain high levels of uncertainty. Root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) and its spatial and temporal hetergeneity influence NEE and contribute as much as 60-80 percent to the uncertainty. Energy and CO2 Fluxes have been monitored from 1997 to 2007 using Bowen Ratio technique, and since spring of 2004 with eddy covariance."

54ca66fee4b0ed5de52f14a5.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) data collection contains data collected by the ASAS sensor flown aboard NASA aircraft. A fundamental use of ASAS data is to characterize and understand the directional variability in solar energy scattered by various land surface cover types (e.g.,crops, forests, prairie grass, snow, or bare soil). The sensor's Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function determines the variation in the reflectance of a surface as a function of both the view zenith angle and solar illumination angle. The ASAS sensor is a hyperspectral, multiangle, airborne remote sensing instrument maintained and operated by the Laboratory for Terrestrial Physics at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The ASAS instrument is mounted on the underside of either NASA C-130 or NASA P-3 aircraft and is capable of off-nadir pointing from approximately 70 degrees forward to 55 degrees aft along the direction of flight. The aircraft is flown at an altitude of 5000 - 6000 meters (approximately 16,000 - 20,000 ft.). Data in the ASAS collection primarily cover areas over the continental United States, but some ASAS data are also available over areas in Canada and western Africa. The ASAS data were collected between 1988 and 1994."

A network of 29 high resolution picture transmission (HRPT) stations, along with data recorded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), acquired daily global land coverage from 1 April, 1992 through September 30, 1993, with the project subsequently extended through 1996. The six major participants (NOAA, ESA, USGS, NASA, CSIRO, and SMC) coordinate HRPT receiving stations to acquire and compile the data set. NOAA coordinates two HRPT receiving stations, Gilmore Creek, Alaska and Wallops Island, Virginia, and schedules the satellite's recorders to obtain local area coverage (LAC) AVHRR 1-km data over areas not covered by the other HRPT receiving stations. This collection of over 40,000 AVHRR images has been archived and made available for distribution by the United States Geological Survey, EROS Center and the European Space Agency."

Carried aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite series, the AVHRR sensor is a broad-band, 4- or 5- channel scanning radiometer sensing in the visible, near-infared, and thermal infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. EROS houses AVHRR High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) data and Local Area Coverage (LAC) data. The HRPT data are full resolution image data transmitted to a ground station as they are collected, while LAC data (also full resolution data) are recorded with an onboard tape recorder for subsequent transmission during a station overpass."

54ca6701e4b0ed5de52f14c9.xml,Purpose,/metadata/idinfo/descript/purpose,"The objective of the AVHRR instrument is to provide radiance data for investigation of clouds, land-water boundaries, snow and ice extent, ice or snow melt inception, day and night cloud distribution, temperatures of radiation surfaces, and sea surface temperature. The AVHRR data collection effort also provides opportunities for studying and monitoring vegetation conditions in ecosystems, including forests, tundra, cloud mask, quality control bands, and grasslands with applications that include agricultural assessment, land cover mapping, production of large-area image maps (e.g., country maps, continental maps, world maps), and evaluation of regional and continental snow cover."
54ca6701e4b0ed5de52f14c9.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"The USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation & Science (EROS) Center ADAPS flow for acquisitions and archiving begins with direct HRPT reception. Initial ingest of the data reformatting includes archive, and creation of browse quick looks and cartridge tapes. The NOAA AVHRR processing flow begins with sensor data receipt by the CDA stations (Wallops Island, Virginia; Gilmore Creek, Alaska; Monterey, California (ftp); Prince Albert, Canada (ftp); and Australia(tape) where the data are re-broadcast via communications satellites to NOAA/NESDIS in Suitland, Maryland. The EROS ADAPS systematic georegistration process references AVHRR data to the Earth's surface. Through modeling, the position and attitude of the TIROS satellite platforms and the canning geometry of the AVHRR sensor, geometric distortions can be minimized. The position of the satellite is determined by an orbital model updated by ephemeris data received daily from NAVY Space Surveillance. The AVHRR sensor model characterizes the non-linear scanning of the sensor mirror. A refinement to the sensor model accounts for the displacement in longitude due to the rotation of the Earth under the satellite. All modeling is referenced to the time of acquisition. As the satellite clock time drifts, a delta time adjustment is applied. Collectively, these models comprise the geometric correction model in ADAPS. The positional accuracy of a systematic georegistration is approximately 5,000 meter, root-mean-square-error (RMSE). 19990930 lta@usgs.gov Long Term Archive (LTA) Representative mailing and physical address Long Term Archive (LTA), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center 47914 252nd Street Sioux Falls SD 57198-0001 USA 1-800-ASK-USGS lta@usgs.gov lta@usgs.gov"

This is called the spectral signature. Other signatures such as tone (lightness or darkness), texture (surface roughness or smoothness), pattern, shadow, shape, and size are as important. The AVHRR sensor was designed to view cold space and one or more internal warm blackbodies for each scan sequence while in orbit. In general, radiometric calibration involves exposing a radiometer to sources of radiation that have been calibrated against primary or secondary standards and determining a relationship between the output of the radiometer and the intensity of the incident radiation (radiance). All of the radiometers flown on the NOAA/TIROS satellites undergo extensive prelaunch testing and calibration by their manufacturers to characterize their performance. The NESDIS independently analyzes the data from the prelaunch tests to determine the operating characteristics of the instruments, such as their signal-to-noise ratios, stability, linearity of response, and sensitivity. However, characteristics cannot be expected to be the same in orbit as they were before the launch. One reason is that the thermal environment varies with position in the orbit, causing sensitivities to vary orbitally. Also, instrument components age in the several years that usually elapse between the time of the prelaunch tests and launch, and the aging process continues during the two or more years the instrument typically operates in orbit. Therefore, the NOAA/TIROS radiometers have been designed to view cold space and one or more internal warm blackbodies as part of their normal scan sequences in orbit. As the spacecraft moves through its orbit, the expected angular distance between the nadir of adjacent LAC/HRPT scans is approximately 0.0296 degrees of arc, or 3.2914 kilometers, as measured from the center of the Earth. The actual value of the average angular distance can vary by up to about 0.1712 kilometers due to variations in satellite height, scan angle, and other factors.

The capsules or buckets were de-orbited and retrieved by aircraft while the capsules parachuted to earth. The exposed film was developed and the images were analyzed for a range of military applications. The KH-7 surveillance system was a high resolution imaging system that was operational from July 1963 to June 1967. Approximately 18,000 black-and-white images and 230 color images are available from the 38 missions flown during this program. Key features for this program were larger area of coverage and improved ground resolution. The cameras acquired imagery in continuous lengthwise sweeps of the terrain. KH-7 images are 9 inches wide, vary in length from 4 inches to 500 feet long, and have a resolution of 2 to 4 feet. The KH-9 mapping program was operational from March 1973 to October 1980 and was designed to support mapping requirements and exact positioning of geographical points for the military. This was accomplished by using image overlap for stereo coverage and by using a camera system with a reseau grid to correct image distortion. The KH-9 framing cameras produced 9 x 18 inch imagery at a resolution of 20-30 feet. Approximately 29,000 mapping images were acquired from 12 missions. The images have variable scales and quality. Cloud cover is common. The digital products are produced from a duplicate negative film source. More than 40 percent of the imagery contains significant cloud cover. The use of browse imagery gives the user the opportunity to review a reduced resolution image to determine if the area of interest is covered and to check for cloud cover. The original film sources are maintained by the (http://www.nara.gov) National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)."

With the success of the first release of classified satellite photography in 1995, images from U.S. military intelligence satellites KH-7 and KH-9 were declassified in accordance with Executive Order 12951 in 2002. The data were originally used for cartographic information and reconnaissance for U.S. intelligence agencies. Since the images could be of historical value for global change research and were no longer critical to national security, the collection was made available to the public."

54ca6703e4b0ed5de52f14d3.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The primary digital orthophotoquadrangle (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 NAD83).The geographic extent of the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the overedge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. The radiometric image brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels, ranging from 0 to 255. The standard, uncompressed gray scale DOQ format contains an ASCII header followed by a series of 8-bit image data lines. The keyword-based, ASCII header may vary in the number of data entries. The header is affixed to the beginning of the image and is composed of strings of 80 characters with an asterisk (*) as character 79 and an invisible newline character as character 80. Each keyword string contains information for either identification, display, or registration of the image. Additional strings of blanks are added to the header so that the length of a header line equals the number of bytes in a line of image data. The header line will be equal in length to the length of an image line. If the sum of the byte count of the header is less than the sample count of one DOQ image line, then the remainder of the header is padded with the requisite number of 80 character blank entries, each terminated with an asterisk and newline character."

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during a mosaicing process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images to improve their tone. All DOQ header data and image file sizes are validated by Tape Validation System (TVS) software prior to archiving in the Sales Data Base. This validation procedure assures correct physical format and field values for header record elements. Logical relationships between header record elements are tested. All DOQ images are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacement exists in the iimage area or in overedge coverage. The DOQ images may be derived by mosaicking multiple images, in order to insure complete coverage. All DOQs are cloud free. Some clouds may, very infrequently, be encountered only in the overedge coverage. Source photography is leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Void areas may exist, having a radiometric value of zero and appearing black. These voids are areas for which no photographic source is available or are the result of image transformation from other planimetric systems to the UTM projection. In the latter case, the void sliver areas are on the outside edges of the overedge area.

The EO-1 mission validated highly integrated multispectral data from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) sensor and hyperspectral imaging data from the Hyperion sensor. After the initial technology mission was accomplished, NASA and the USGS agreed to continue the EO-1 program due to high interest in the specialized data from scientific communities. EO-1 Data products consist of imagery collected during the original one-year mission, as well as more recent Data Acquisition Requests (DARs) from the EO-1 Extended Mission. EO-1 scenes are processed to Level 1Gst (L1Gst) and images with adequate ground control points are processed to Level 1T (L1T). L1Gst and L1T products are provided in GeoTIFF format. Scenes that have been processed to L1T are also available as Full Resolution Browse and GIS Ready Bundle products in JPEG format. Level 1R (L1R) products in HDF format are only available for Hyperion data."

The EO-1 mission validated highly integrated multispectral data from the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) sensor and hyperspectral imaging data from the Hyperion sensor. After the initial technology mission was accomplished, NASA and the USGS agreed to continue the EO-1 program due to high interest in the specialized data from scientific communities. EO-1 Data products consist of imagery collected during the original one-year mission, as well as more recent Data Acquisition Requests (DARs) from the EO-1 Extended Mission. EO-1 scenes are processed to Level 1Gst (L1Gst) and images with adequate ground control points are processed to Level 1T (L1T). L1Gst and L1T products are provided in GeoTIFF format. Scenes that have been processed to L1T are also available as Full Resolution Browse and GIS Ready Bundle products in JPEG format. Level 1R (L1R) products in HDF format are only available for Hyperion data."

54ca6710e4b0ed5de52f14eb.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets are a collection of orthorectified, cloud-minimized Landsat-type satellite images, providing near complete coverage of the global land area decadally since the early 1970s. The global mosaics are centered on 1975, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010, and consist of data acquired from four sensors: Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, Thematic Mapper, Multispectral Scanner, and Advanced Land Imager. The GLS datasets have been widely used in land-cover and land-use change studies at local, regional, and global scales. This study evaluates the GLS datasets with respect to their spatial coverage, temporal consistency, geodetic accuracy, radiometric calibration consistency, image completeness, extent of cloud contamination, and residual gaps. In general, the three latest GLS datasets are of a better quality than the GLS-1990 and GLS-1975 datasets, with most of the imagery (85%) having cloud cover of less than 10%, the acquisition years clustered much more tightly around their target years, better co-registration relative to GLS-2000, and better radiometric absolute calibration. Probably, the most significant impediment to scientific use of the datasets is the variability of image phenology (i.e., acquisition day of year). This paper provides end-users with an assessment of the quality of the GLS datasets for specific applications, and where possible, suggestions for mitigating their deficiencies."

In January 1983 operations of the Landsat system were transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In October 1985 the Landsat system was commercialized. After that date, all Landsat commercial rights became the property of Space Imaging, with exclusive sales rights to all U.S. thematic mapper (TM) data. Throughout these changes, the USGS retained primary responsibility as the Government's long-term archive of Landsat data. As of July 1, 2001, Space Imaging relinquished their commercial right to Landsat data.

This archive provides a rich collection of information about the Earth's land surface. Major characteristics and changes to the surface of the planet can be detected, measured, and analyzed using Landsat data. The effects of desertification, deforestation, pollution, cataclysmic volcanic activity, and other natural and anthropogenic events can be examined using data acquired from the Landsat series of Earth-observing satellites. The information obtainable from the historical and current Landsat data play a key role in studying changes to the Earth's surface. Landsat data have been used by government, commercial, industrial, civilian, and educational communities in the US and worldwide. They are being used to support a wide range of applications in such areas as global change research, agriculture, forestry, geology, resources management, geography, mapping, water quality, and oceanography. The types of changes that can be identified include agricultural development, deforestation, natural disaster, urbanization, and the development and degradation of water resources."

An orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief, sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map. A digital orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image. The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel."

Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices. The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products provide continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows. https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac/products/modis_products_table"

Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices. The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products provide continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows. https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac/products/modis_products_table"

54ca673ce4b0ed5de52f15b0.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP) was coordinated by the USGS as an interagency project to acquire cloud-free aerial photographs at an altitude of 20,000 feet above mean terrain elevation. The photographs were taken with a 6-inch focal length lens and are at a scale of 1:40,000. Coverage over the conterminous United States includes both black-and-white (BW) and color infrared (CIR) aerial photographs. Film type and extent of coverage were determined by available funds and operational requirements. The NAPP program, which was operational from 1987 to 2007, consists of more than 1.3 million images. Photographs were acquired on 9-inch film and were centered over quarters of USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles. Photographs are available as medium resolution digital images in Tagged Image File Format (TIFF). Medium resolution digital products were created with a digital single-lens reflex camera at a resolution of 63 microns, or 400 dots per inch (dpi)."

The aim of the program was to cover the 48 conterminous states over a 5-year span. In the NHAP program, black-and-white and color-infrared aerial photographs were obtained on 9-inch film from an altitude of 40,000 feet above mean terrain elevation and are centered over USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles. The color-infrared photographs are at a scale of 1:58,000 (1 inch equals about .9 miles), and the black-and-white photographs are at a scale of 1:80,000 (1 inch equals about 1.26 miles). All NHAP flights where flown in a North to South direction. These photographs are offered as digital images."

54ca673fe4b0ed5de52f15d8.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a partnership between NASA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Flown aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Endeavour (11-22 February 2000), SRTM fulfilled its mission to map the world in three dimensions. The USGS is under agreement with NGA and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to distribute SRTM elevation products derived from the C-band radar data. SRTM utilized interferomic C-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar to generate elevation data over 80 percent of the Earth's land surface. The SRTM collection was edited to delineate and flatten water bodies, better define coastlines, remove spikes and wells, and fill small voids. Since some areas of missing data or voids were still present in the SRTM collection, the NGA filled the voids using interpolation algorithms in conjunction with other sources of elevation data. The SRTM Void Filled data set are the result of this additional processing."
