03132-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"GAP species range data show a coarse representation of the total areal extent of a species or the geographic limits within which a species can be found (Morrison and Hall 2002). To represent these geographic limits, GAP compiled existing GAP data, where available, and NatureServe data (Patterson et al. 2003, Ridgely et al. 2007, NatureServe 2010) IUCN data (IUCN 2004), where needed. Data provided by GAP in collaboration with the Northwest Gap Analysis Project (NWGAP), the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP), the Southeast Gap Analysis Project (SEGAP), the Alaska Gap Analysis Project (AKGAP), the Hawaii Gap Analysis Project (HIGAP), the Puerto Rico Gap Analysis Project (PRGAP), and the U.S. Virgin Islands Gap Analysis Project (USVIGAP). Web map services for species ranges can be accessed via: http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Birds http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Mammals http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Amphibians http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Reptiles A table listing all of GAP's available web map services can be found here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species/data/web-map-services/ Bird data provided by NatureServe in collaboration with Robert Ridgely, James Zook, The Nature Conservancy's Migratory Bird Program, Conservation International's Center for Applied Biodiversity Science (CABS), World Wildlife Fund US, and Environment Canada's WILDSPACE. Mammal data provided by NatureServe in collaboration with Bruce Patterson, Wes Sechrest, Marcelo Tognelli, Gerardo Ceballos, The Nature Conservancy's Migratory Bird Program, Conservation International's CABS, World Wildlife Fund US, and Environment Canada's WILDSPACE. Reptile data were provided by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Amphibian data developed as part of the Global Amphibian Assessment and provided by IUCN-World Conservation Union, Conservation International and NatureServe. Once the needed range data were compiled it was intersected with Natural Resource Conservation Service National Watershed Boundary dataset of 12-digit hydrological units for the US (U.S. Geological Survey and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2009). Range data were attributed with information regarding occurrence/presence, origin, reproductive use, and seasonal use from GAP regional projects (SWReGAP, SEGAP, NWGAP, AKGAP, HIGAP, PRGAP, and USVIGAP), NatureServe data, and IUCN data. GAP used the best information available to create these species ranges; however GAP seeks to improve and update these data as new information becomes available. These species range data provide the biological context within which to build our species distribution models. Recommended citation: U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program (USGS-GAP). [Year].

03204-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is an element of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). GAP helps to implement the Department of Interior?s goals of inventory, monitoring, research, and information transfer. GAP has three primary goals: 1 Identify conservation gaps that help keep common species common; 2 Provide conservation information to the public so that informed resource management decisions can be made; and 3 Facilitate the application of GAP data and analysis to specific resource management activities. To implement these goals, GAP carries out the following objectives: --Map the land cover of the United States --Map predicted distributions of vertebrate species for the U.S. --Map the location, ownership and stewardship of protected areas --Document the representation of vertebrate species and land cover types in areas managed for the long-term maintenance of biodiversity --Provide this information to the public and those entities charged with land use research, policy, planning, and management --Build institutional cooperation in the application of this information to state and regional management activities. GAP provides the following data and web services: The Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and other conservation lands, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The PADUS GAP Status Layer web service can be found at http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/PADUS_Status/MapServer . The Land Cover Data creates a seamless data set for the contiguous United States from the four regional Gap Analysis Projects and the LANDFIRE project. The Raster data in both ArcGIS Grid and ERDAS Imagine format is available for download at http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/land_cover/Map.aspx . In addition to the raster datasets the data is available in Web Mapping Services (WMS) format for each of the six NVC classification levels (Class, Subclass, Formation, Division, Macrogroup, Ecological System) at the following links. http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Class_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Subclass_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Formation_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Division_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Macrogroup_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_Ecological_Systems_Landuse/MapServer The GAP species range data show a coarse representation of the total areal extent of a species or the geographic limits within which a species can be found (Morrison and Hall 2002). The GAP species distribution models represent the areas where species are predicted to occur based on habitat associations. A full report documenting the parameters used in each species model can be found via: http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/species/Map.aspx Web map services for species distribution models can be accessed from: http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Birds http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Mammals http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Amphibians http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Reptiles A table listing all of GAP's available web map services can be found here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species/data/web-map-services/"

The Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and conservation lands nationally, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The lands included in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves); 2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3) GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected area's inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre's World Database for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, 'A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values' and are categorized following a classification scheme available through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to the Global Community. PAD-US version 1.2 updates include: 1) National Park Service (NPS) boundaries and GAP Status Code review in cooperation with NPScape and NPS Lands. 2) Department of Defense (DOD) boundaries in cooperation with DOD Partners in Flight 3) Official (member and eligible only) Marine Protected Areas as aggregated and accepted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 4)The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) authoritative boundaries in cooperation with NLCS policy representitives and the Lands Division. Note: NLCS National Trails and Wild and Scenic Rivers were not updated as they are managed as Line files; however, PADUS already contained many of these protected areas. 5) Modified or newly created Wilderness Area boundaries created by The Omnibus Public Lands Act of 2009 in cooperation with Wilderness.net. 6) Protected areas in The US Virgin Islands 7) Protected areas in the Pacific Islands (Micronesia) 8) Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife protected areas The mission of the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is to provide state, regional and national assessments of the conservation status of native vertebrate species and natural land cover types and to facilitate the application of this information to land management activities. The PAD-US geodatabase is required to organize and assess the management status (i.e. apply GAP Status Codes) of elements of biodiversity protection. The goal of GAP is to keep common species common by identifying species and plant communities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. Common species are those not currently threatened with extinction. By identifying their habitats, Gap Analysis gives land managers and policy makers the information they need to make better-informed decisions when identifying priority areas for conservation. In cooperation with UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre, GAP ensures PAD-US also supports global analyses and policy decisions by maintaining World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes and data for International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categorized protected areas in the United States. The USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) aggregated the Protected Areas Database of the United States version 1.2 (PAD-US v1.1) with significant contributions from the Bureau of Land Management, The US Forest Service, GreenInfo Network, Applied Geographics and The Nature Conservancy, who provided a spatial dataset of public and private lands and waters secured by a conservation situation that includes an explicit level of security from future conversion and current incompatible uses. These are spatial data from TNC's Conservation Lands System (CLS) database, which is the legal database of record for all TNC land transactions (fee, easement, lease and deed restrictions). GAP seeks to increase the efficiency and accuracy of PAD-US updates by leveraging resources in protected areas data aggregation and maintenance as described in 'A Map of the Future', published following the PAD-US Design Project (July, 2009) available from:http://www.protectedlands.net/.

03209-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"OBIS-USA provides aggregated, interoperable biogeographic data collected primarily from U.S. waters and oceanic regions--the Arctic, the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. It provides access to datasets from state and federal agencies as well as educational and research institutions. OBIS-USA handles both specimen-based data and survey results. Survey data come from recovered archives and current research activities. The datasets document where and when species were observed or collected, bringing together marine biogeographic data that are spatially, taxonomically, and temporally comprehensive. The public OBIS-USA site (http://www.usgs.gov/obis-usa) provides actual data contents as well as summary data about what is contained in each dataset to assist users in evaluating suitability for use. Current functionality allows the user to locate, view, and aggregate the datasets and FGDC compliant metadata as well as to view and search the taxonomic, geographic, and temporal extent. To promote data interoperability, the data are available in accordance with the marine-focused implementation of the Darwin Core data standard. In addition to basic download functions (tab-delimited), OBIS-USA offers web services for query flexibility and a wide range of output formats, such as kml, NetCDF, MATLAB, json, and graph or map output, to enable diverse types of scientific and geospatial data use and analysis platforms and products. OBIS-USA's two web services (ERDDAP and GeoServer) enable integration of OBIS-USA biogeographic data with other data types, such as seafloor geology, physical oceanography, water chemistry, and climate data. The NOAA Environmental Research Division Data Access Program(ERRDDAP) enables users to query scientific data by flexible parameters and obtain output in many formats. Access can be found at http://www1.usgs.gov/erddap/tabledap/AllMBG.html . OBIS-USA uses the tabledap component of ERDDAP to access Darwin-Core-type tabular spatial data; tabledap is a superset of the OPeNDAP DAP constraint protocol. The GeoServer project is a full transactional Java (J2EE) implementation of the OpenGIS Consortium's Web Feature Server specification and Web Coverage Server specification, with an integrated Web Map Server. OBIS-USA offers Web Map Service (WMS) access to Darwin-Core-type point data at [INSERT URL!!!]. OBIS-USA and collaborators are further deploying the Darwin Core standard to capture richer information, such as absence and abundance, observations on effort, individual tracking, and more advanced biogeography capabilities. Data are accepted into OBIS-USA from the data originator or holder, minimizing the burden on the participant. OBIS-USA works with data providers to understand the best process to transfer the data, review the data prior to their release, gather comprehensive metadata, and then allow public access to this information. Becoming part of the OBIS-USA network is intended to have tangible benefits for participants, for example, freeing the participant from responding to requests for data and alleviating security concerns since users do not directly access the participant's computers."

03215-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"GAP distribution models represent the areas where species are predicted to occur based on habitat associations. GAP distribution models are the spatial arrangement of environments suitable for occupation by a species. In other words, a species distribution is created using a deductive model to predict areas suitable for occupation within a species range. To represent these suitable environments, GAP compiled existing GAP data, where available, and compiled additional data where needed. Existing data sources were the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) and the Southeast Gap Analysis Project (SEGAP) as well as a data compiled by Sanborn Solutions and Mason, Bruce and Girard. Habitat associations were based on land cover data of ecological systems and--when applicable for the given taxon--on ancillary variables such as elevation, hydrologic characteristics, human avoidance characteristics, forest edge, ecotone widths, etc. Distribution models were generated using a python script that selects model variables based on literature cited information stored in a wildlife habitat relationship database (WHRdb); literature used includes primary and gray publications. Distribution models are 30 meter raster data and delimited by GAP species ranges. Distribution model data were attributed with information regarding seasonal use based on GAP regional projects (NWGAP, SWReGAP, SEGAP, AKGAP, HIGAP, PRGAP, and USVIGAP), NatureServe data, and IUCN data. A full report documenting the parameters used in each species model can be found via: http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/species/Map.aspx Web map services for species distribution models can be accessed from: http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Birds http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Mammals http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Amphibians http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/NAT_Species_Reptiles A table listing all of GAP's available web map services can be found here: http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/species/data/web-map-services/ GAP used the best information available to create these species distribution models; however GAP seeks to improve and update these data as new information becomes available.

The U.S. Geological Survey shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that GAP's species range data will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question. While it is impossible to predict all the uses of these data we have listed several possible appropriate and inappropriate uses from GAP's perspective.

This disclaimer applies both to individual use of the data and aggregate use with other data. Appropriate uses of the data: primarily as a coarse map for a large area such as a county or to provide context for finer-level maps.

The U.S. Geological Survey shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. All information is created with a specific end use or uses in mind. This is especially true for GIS data, which is expensive to produce and must be directed to meet the immediate program needs. However, these data were created with the expectation that they would be used for other applications; therefore, we list below both appropriate and inappropriate uses. This list is in no way exhaustive but should serve as a guide to assess whether a proposed use can or cannot be supported by these data. For many uses, it is unlikely that GAP's species range data will provide the only data needed, and for uses with a regulatory outcome, field surveys should verify the result. In the end, it will be the responsibility of each data user to determine if these data can answer the question being asked, and if they are the best tool to answer that question.

03268-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"This dataset combines the work of several different projects to create a seamless data set for the contiguous United States. Data from four regional Gap Analysis Projects and the LANDFIRE project were combined to make this dataset. In the northwestern United States (Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Washington and Wyoming) data in this map came from the Northwest Gap Analysis Project. In the southwestern United States (Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah) data used in this map came from the Southwest Gap Analysis Project. The data for Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia came from the Southeast Gap Analysis Project and the California data was generated by the updated California Gap land cover project. The Hawaii Gap Analysis project provided the data for Hawaii. In areas of the county (central U.S., Northeast, Alaska) that have not yet been covered by a regional Gap Analysis Project, data from the Landfire project was used. Similarities in the methods used by these projects made possible the combining of the data they derived into one seamless coverage. They all used multi-season satellite imagery (Landsat ETM+) from 1999-2001 in conjunction with digital elevation model (DEM) derived datasets (e.g. elevation, landform) to model natural and semi-natural vegetation. Vegetation classes were drawn from NatureServe's Ecological System Classification (Comer et al. 2003) or classes developed by the Hawaii Gap project. Additionally, all of the projects included land use classes that were employed to describe areas where natural vegetation has been altered. In many areas of the country these classes were derived from the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD). For the majority of classes and, in most areas of the country, a decision tree classifier was used to discriminate ecological system types. In some areas of the country, more manual techniques were used to discriminate small patch systems and systems not distinguishable through topography. The data contains multiple levels of thematic detail. At the most detailed level natural vegetation is represented by NatureServe's Ecological System classification (or in Hawaii the Hawaii GAP classification). These most detailed classifications have been crosswalked to the five highest levels of the National Vegetation Classification (NVC), Class, Subclass, Formation, Division and Macrogroup. This crosswalk allows users to display and analyze the data at different levels of thematic resolution. Developed areas, or areas dominated by introduced species, timber harvest, or water are represented by other classes, collectively refered to as land use classes; these land use classes occur at each of the thematic levels. Raster data in both ArcGIS Grid and ERDAS Imagine format is available for download at http://gis1.usgs.gov/csas/gap/viewer/land_cover/Map.aspx Six layer files are included in the download packages to assist the user in displaying the data at each of the Thematic levels in ArcGIS. In adition to the raster datasets the data is available in Web Mapping Services (WMS) format for each of the six NVC classification levels (Class, Subclass, Formation, Division, Macrogroup, Ecological System) at the following links. http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Class_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Subclass_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Formation_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Division_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_NVC_Macrogroup_Landuse/MapServer http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/gap/GAP_Land_Cover_Ecological_Systems_Landuse/MapServer"

03300-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"ITIS is an easily accessible database with reliable information on species names and their hierarchical classification that is publicly accessible with unlimited free use. The database is reviewed periodically to ensure high quality with valid classifications, revisions, and additions of newly described species. The ITIS includes documented taxonomic information of flora and fauna from both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. For each scientific name, ITIS includes the authority, taxonomic rank, a unique taxonomic serial number, data source information, data quality indicators, and associated synonyms and vernacular names where available. Geographic coverage is worldwide, with an emphasis on North American taxa. The ITIS Web Services provide the ability to search and retrieve data from ITIS by providing access to the data behind the ITIS web site (http://www.itis.gov/web_service.html#). There is also web interface for viewing reports, and several options for text downloads. Each part of the basic WSDL web services is provided by a web service API, which defines the name, input to, and output from the service for a particular data request. For more information visit http://www.itis.gov/ws_description.html . To develop a web service client visit http://www.itis.gov/ws_develop.html ."

03300-metadata.xml,Lineage Statement,/metadata/dataqual/lineage,"ITIS data conform with the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature Unknown ITIS was established as a cooperative project among several federal agencies to improve and expand upon taxonomic data maintained by the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). ITIS inherited approximately 210,000 scientific names with varying levels of data quality from the NODC data set. Data content development and quality assurance strategy proceeds on two tracks: (1) adding new names or checklists with a high level of taxonomic credibility, and (2) reviewing and verifying the legacy NODC data, thereby bringing it to a minimal, or higher, standard of data quality. For a view of ITIS source information, see http://www.itis.gov/contrib.html Unknown ITIS accepts submissions of taxonomic data from the world scientific community. Data stewards and other cooperating specialists in the systematics community submit and review data. Data are reviewed and verified, and each scientific name is assigned a Taxonomic Serial Number (TSN), which is a unique and persistent identifier of scientific names of biological organisms within the ITIS reference system. For complete guidelines see --http://www.itis.gov/submit_guidlines.html Unknown"

ITIS Web Services NA The ITIS Web Services provide the ability to search and retrieve data from ITIS by providing access to the data behind the ITIS web site. There is also web interface for viewing reports, and several options for text downloads. Each part of the basic WSDL web services is provided by a web service API, which defines the name, input to, and output from the service for a particular data request. For more information see http://www.itis.gov/ws_description.html The ITIS JSON services provide an API that matches the Web Service API. All calls for JSON data are made by substituting 'jsonservice' into the Web Service call in place of the 'services/ITISService' part of the URL. Besides standard JSON output, you can also get JSON data from the web service in JSON-P format. This provides the JSON data wrapped in a JavaScript function for safer cross-domain Ajax calls. http://www.itis.gov/web_service.html# None Database, available in several download formats including MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, and PostgreSql.

03302-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"Version 3.0 of the NFHP Data System consists of data access and visualization tools and underlying data management tools and functions. The NFHP National Assessment Results Viewer allows users to visualize the primary results reported in Through a Fish's Eye: The Status of Fish Habitats in the United States 2010 at various spatial scales. It depicts the condition of stream and coastal habitats across the country on a variety of base maps and provides one-click access to more detailed information at finer scales. The NFHP Data Theme Viewer provides a summarized look at available data by theme. Datasets are displayed to show data distribution and data density nationally, compared to available data linked to the NFHP spatial framework. The first theme to be provided is the Biological Data theme. Future priority data themes will be determined through the efforts of the National Science and Data Committee. The NFHP Data System provides streamlined data access and download capabilities for national and partnership data via a familiar Web page format. Behind the scenes, data management and delivery tools are powered by two existing USGS systems to enhance the data sharing, documentation, and delivery capabilities available to partners: USGS ScienceBase provides the data file upload and catalog services, while the USGS Core Science Metadata Clearinghouse assists with data documentation and preservation best practices that will improve the ability for partners, researchers, and managers whom access and use data now and in the future."

03306-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The USGS Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) project is an online mapping information system consisting of a large collection of species occurrence datasets (e.g., plants and animals) found in the United States, with relevant geospatial layers. Species occurrences are records of organisms at a particular time and location that are often collected as part of biological field studies and taxonomic collections. These data serve as a foundation for biodiversity and conservation research. BISON supports several data interchange formats to enable developers to write custom applications (http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/services.html). The BISON search API supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The SOLR search API supports JSONP. The Web Mapping Services support Portable Network Graphics (PNG). Example Web services applications have been written using OpenLayers, and HTML 5 and we are working on mobile applications."

The BISON search API supports JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The SOLR search API supports JSONP. The Web Mapping Services support Portable Network Graphics (PNG). Example Web services applications have been written using OpenLayers, and HTML 5 and we are working on mobile applications. Some query types include: - number of occurrences in each county and state in the United States. - rendering of BISON data in a mapping application such as OpenLayers (heatmaps and points). - retrieving raw spatial data and applying optimized mathematics (without Solr geospatial operators). - single taxa name searches by scientific or common name, optionally constrained by a gegraphic polygon, state, county, fips, basis of record, year, or provider. // In addition to these interchange formats, BISON also provides access to complete raw data files for the resources it provides directly (not through GBIF) in .csv format and metadata for each resource in Ecological Metadata Language (EML.xml). This information is downloadable from BISON's Integrated Publishing Toolkit (IPT), here: http://bison.ornl.gov/ipt/. The raw dataset .csv files that are downloadable from the IPT often contain much richer information (many more fields) than can be included within the BISON application. http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/services.html None The ordering process is via digital download. After agreeing to our terms of use, data is either immediately made available or (if the download is large) emailed upon request. Available formats are CSV, TXT, UTF8, Google Earth KML, and zipped Shapefile bundle."

The MARIS structure was developed by a consortium of state fish and wildlife agencies and implemented through contracts with various universities. Federal agency partners have provided the core funding for developing and implementing MARIS as well as broad guidance on the content of the system."

This layer depicts every fish and/or water quality sampling location submitted by participating MARIS states. Each point is attributed with the originator (who submitted the data), the name of the dataset (multiple datasets may have been submitted for each originator), and a unique 'water ID' which has been generated by the MARIS project for each sampling point. The 'maris_water_id' field can be used to link each sampling point with fish and/or water quality data for each point, which is available as summarized tables within this map service. See the service descriptions for each table for more information. Note that the entire MARIS database is also available for download at marisdata.org. http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/maris/maris_data_public/MapServer/0 MARIS Database Status The Multistate Aquatic Resources Information System (MARIS) is a cooperative effort between state and federal agencies to share fisheries information collected as part of ongoing sampling programs. This layer depicts the states which have provided data to the MARIS project, states for which data is currently being processed (coming soon), and states which have not yet provided data. The attribute table provide some basic statistics for each state, such as the date range of data and the number of streams, lakes, species, and water quality samples that are available for each state. http://gis1.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/maris/maris_data_public/MapServer/1 maris_species_list_by_location The Multistate Aquatic Resources Information System (MARIS) is a cooperative effort between state and federal agencies to share fisheries information collected as part of ongoing sampling programs.

03363-metadata.xml,Abstract,/metadata/idinfo/descript/abstract,"The Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase, managed by U. S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Program, that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and other conservation lands, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The geodatabase contains four feature classes such as, ?Marine Protected Areas (MPA)? and ?Easements? that each contains uniquely associated attributes. These two feature classes are combined with the PAD-US ?Fee? feature class to provide a full inventory of protected areas in a common schema (i.e. ?Combined? file). Legitimate and other protected area overlaps exist in the full inventory, with Easements loaded on top of Fee and MPAs under both. Parcel data within a protected area are dissolved in this file that powers the PAD-US Viewer. As overlaps exist, GAP creates separate analytical layers to summarize area statistics for 'GAP Status Code' and 'Owner Name'. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for more information. The lands included in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves); 2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3) GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected area's inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre's World Database for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, 'A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values' and are categorized following a classification scheme available through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to the Global Community. The geodatabase contains a Marine Protected Area (MPA) feature class and Easements feature class, each with uniquely associated attribute. These two feature classes are combined with the PAD-US fee feature class with standard PAD-US attributes to provide a full inventory of protected areas in a common schema. As legitimate and other overlaps exist in the combined inventory GAP creates separate analytical layers to obtain area statistics for 'GAP Status Code' and 'Owner Name'. PAD-US version 1.3 Combined updates include: 1) State, local government and private protected area updates delivered September 2011 from PAD-US State Data Stewards: CO (Colorado State University), FL (Florida Natural Areas Inventory), ID (Idaho Fish and Game), MA (The Commonwealth's Office of Geographic Information Systems, MassGIS), MO (University of Missouri, MoRAP), MT (Montana Natural Heritage Program), NM (Natural Heritage New Mexico), OR (Oregon Natural Heritage Program), VA (Department of Conservation and Recreation, Virginia Natural Heritage Program). 2) Select local government (i.e. county, city) protected areas (3,632) across the country (to complement the current PAD-US inventory) aggregated by the Trust for Public Land (TPL) for their Conservation Almanac that tracks the conservation finance movement across the country. 3) A new ?Date of Establishment? field that identifies the year an area was designated or otherwise protected, attributed for 86% of GAP Status Code 1 and 2 protected areas. Additional dates will be provided in future updates. 4) A national wilderness area update from wilderness.net 5) The ??Access? field that describes public access to protected areas as defined by data stewards or categorical assignment by Primary Designation Type. . The new ?Access Source? field documents local vs. categorical assignments. See the PAD-US Standard Manual for more information: gapanalysis.usgs.gov/padus 6) The transfer of conservation measures (i.e. GAP Status Codes, IUCN Categories) and documentation (i.e. GAP Code Source, GAP Code Date) from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorical assignments (see PAD-US Standard) when not provided by data stewards 7) Integration of non-sensitive National Conservation Easement Database (NCED) easements from August 2011, July 2012 with PAD-US version 1.2 easements. Duplicates were removed, unless 'Stacked' = Y and multiple easements exist. 8) Unique ID's transferred from NCED or requested for new easements. NCED and PAD-US are linked via Source UID in the PAD-US version 1.3 Easement feature class. 9) Official (member and eligible) MPAs from the NOAA MPA Inventory (March 2011, www.mpa.gov) translated into the PAD-US schema with conservation measures transferred from PAD-US version 1.2 or categorically assigned to new protected areas. Contact the PAD-US Coordinator for documentation of categorical GAP Status Code assignments for MPAs. 10) Identified MPA records that overlap existing protected areas in the PAD-US Fee feature class (i.e. PADUS Overlap field in MPA feature class). For example, many National Wildlife Refuges and National Parks are also MPAs and are represented in the PAD-US MPA and Fee feature classes.(ei"

GAP_Sts The GAP Status Code is a measure of management intent to conserve biodiversity defined as: Status 1: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a natural state within which disturbance events (of natural type, frequency, intensity, and legacy) are allowed to proceed without interference or are mimicked through management. Status 2: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover and a mandated management plan in operation to maintain a primarily natural state, but which may receive uses or management practices that degrade the quality of existing natural communities, including suppression of natural disturbance. Status 3: An area having permanent protection from conversion of natural land cover for the majority of the area, but subject to extractive uses of either a broad, low-intensity type (e.g., logging, OHV recreation) or localized intense type (e.g., mining).

Producer defined See the information listed for this attribute above in the 'Attribute Definition' and 'Attribute Definition Source' sections. GAPCdSrc An acronym to describe the organization(s) that applied the Gap Status Code to the polygon. This field also describes the methods used for assigning GAP Status as follows: 'GAP - Default' is assigned when GAP's categorical assignment of status has been applied, without more detailed review or inquiry. 'GAP' is assigned when standard methods (management plan reviewed and/or land manager interviewed to assign GAP Status to a protected area) apply as provided above. 'GAP - other organization' (e.g. GAP - NPS) applies when the measure is assigned in partnership with GAP, including review. When another organization applied GAP Status according to their methods then 'other organization' (e.g. TNC) is assigned. See the PADUS Standards Manual for more information. Producer defined See the information listed for this attribute above in the 'Attribute Definition' and 'Attribute Definition Source' sections.

Producer defined See the information listed for this attribute above in the 'Attribute Definition' and 'Attribute Definition Source' sections. IUCN_cat International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) management categories assigned to protected areas for inclusion in the UNEP- World Conservation Monitoring Center's (WCMC) World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) and the Commission for Environmental Cooperation's (CEC) North American Terrestrial Protected Areas Database. IUCN defines a protected area as, 'A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values'. Categorization follows as: Category Ia: Strict Nature Reserves are strictly protected areas set aside to protect biodiversity and also possibly geological / geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts are strictly controlled and limited to ensure preservation of the conservation values. Such protected areas can serve as indispensible reference areas for scientific research and monitoring. Category Ib: Wilderness Areas are protected areas are usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas, retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or significant human habitation, which are protected and managed so as to preserve their natural condition. Category II: National Park protected areas are large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities. Category III: Natural Monument or Feature protected areas are set aside to protect a specfic natural monument, which can be a land form, sea mount, submarine caverns, geological feature such as caves or even a living feature such as an ancient grove. They are generally quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value. Category IV: Habitat/species management protected areas aim to protect particular species or habitats and management reflects this priority. Many category IV protected areas will need regular, active interventions to address the requirements of particular species or to maintain habitats, but this is not a requirement of this category. Category V: Protected landscape/seascape protected areas occur where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value. Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources are generally large, with much of the area in a more-or-less natural condition and wherea a proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where such exploitation is seen as one of the main aims of the area. See the PADUS Standards Manual for a summary of methods. Producer defined See the information listed for this attribute above in the 'Attribute Definition' and 'Attribute Definition Source' sections. Access Level of public access permitted. Open ? no special requirements for public access to the property (may include regular hours available); Restricted ? requires a special permit from the owner for access, a registration permit on public land or has highly variable times when open to use; Closed ? no public access allowed (land bank property, special ecological study areas, military bases, etc. Unknown ? no available information. Access is assigned categorically by Primary Designation Type (See the PAD-US Standards Manual) when Unknown. Producer defined See the information listed for this attribute above in the 'Attribute Definition' and 'Attribute Definition Source' sections. Access_Src Documents the Source of Access domain assignment (e.g. State Data Steward or GAP Default categorical assignment). When locally assigned Access Source identifies that organization, generally the ?Aggregator Source?, and follows the Aggregator Source standard. If Access is ?Unknown?, categorical assignments are made by Primary Designation Type and Access Source = ?GAP Default?. Producer defined See the information listed for this attribute above in the 'Attribute Definition' and 'Attribute Definition Source' sections. Date_Est The Year (yyyy) the protected area was designated, decreed or otherwise established. Date is assigned by name, regardless of overlaps in topology (e.g. Yellowstone National Park: 1872, Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness Area: 1980) Producer defined See the information listed for this attribute above in the 'Attribute Definition' and 'Attribute Definition Source' sections. WDPA_Cd A site identifier assigned by UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Center (WCMC) and core attribute in the World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) maintained by GAP.

The Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) is a geodatabase that illustrates and describes public land ownership, management and conservation lands nationally, including voluntarily provided privately protected areas. The lands included in PAD-US are assigned conservation measures that qualify their intent to manage lands for the preservation of biological diversity and to other natural, recreational and cultural uses; managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means. The geodatabase includes: 1) Geographic boundaries of public land ownership and voluntarily provided private conservation lands (e.g., Nature Conservancy Preserves); 2) The combination land owner, land manager, management designation or type, parcel name, GIS Acres and source of geographic information of each mapped land unit 3) GAP Status Code conservation measure of each parcel based on USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) protection level categories which provide a measurement of management intent for long-term biodiversity conservation 4) IUCN category for a protected area's inclusion into UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre's World Database for Protected Areas. IUCN protected areas are defined as, 'A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values' and are categorized following a classification scheme available through USGS GAP; 5) World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes linking the multiple parcels of a single protected area in PAD-US and connecting them to the Global Community. PAD-US version 1.2 updates include: 1) National Park Service (NPS) boundaries and GAP Status Code review in cooperation with NPScape and NPS Lands. 2) Department of Defense (DOD) boundaries in cooperation with DOD Partners in Flight 3) Official (member and eligible only) Marine Protected Areas as aggregated and accepted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 4)The Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) authoritative boundaries in cooperation with NLCS policy representitives and the Lands Division. Note: NLCS National Trails and Wild and Scenic Rivers were not updated as they are managed as Line files; however, PADUS already contained many of these protected areas. 5) Modified or newly created Wilderness Area boundaries created by The Omnibus Public Lands Act of 2009 in cooperation with Wilderness.net. 6) Protected areas in The US Virgin Islands 7) Protected areas in the Pacific Islands (Micronesia) 8) Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife protected areas The mission of the USGS Gap Analysis Program (GAP) is to provide state, regional and national assessments of the conservation status of native vertebrate species and natural land cover types and to facilitate the application of this information to land management activities. The PAD-US geodatabase is required to organize and assess the management status (i.e. apply GAP Status Codes) of elements of biodiversity protection. The goal of GAP is to keep common species common by identifying species and plant communities not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. Common species are those not currently threatened with extinction. By identifying their habitats, Gap Analysis gives land managers and policy makers the information they need to make better-informed decisions when identifying priority areas for conservation. In cooperation with UNEP-World Conservation Monitoring Centre, GAP ensures PAD-US also supports global analyses and policy decisions by maintaining World Database for Protected Areas (WDPA) Site Codes and data for International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categorized protected areas in the United States. The USGS National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) aggregated the Protected Areas Database of the United States version 1.2 (PAD-US v1.1) with significant contributions from the Bureau of Land Management, The US Forest Service, GreenInfo Network, Applied Geographics and The Nature Conservancy, who provided a spatial dataset of public and private lands and waters secured by a conservation situation that includes an explicit level of security from future conversion and current incompatible uses. These are spatial data from TNC's Conservation Lands System (CLS) database, which is the legal database of record for all TNC land transactions (fee, easement, lease and deed restrictions). GAP seeks to increase the efficiency and accuracy of PAD-US updates by leveraging resources in protected areas data aggregation and maintenance as described in 'A Map of the Future', published following the PAD-US Design Project (July, 2009) available from:http://www.protectedlands.net/.

IUCN defines a protected area as, 'A clearly defined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values'. Categorization follows as: Category Ia: Strict Nature Reserves are strictly protected areas set aside to protect biodiversity and also possibly geological / geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts are strictly controlled and limited to ensure preservation of the conservation values. Such protected areas can serve as indispensible reference areas for scientific research and monitoring. Category Ib: Wilderness Areas are protected areas are usually large unmodified or slightly modified areas, retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or significant human habitation, which are protected and managed so as to preserve their natural condition. Category II: National Park protected areas are large natural or near natural areas set aside to protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities. Category III: Natural Monument or Feature protected areas are set aside to protect a specfic natural monument, which can be a land form, sea mount, submarine caverns, geological feature such as caves or even a living feature such as an ancient grove. They are generally quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value. Category IV: Habitat/species management protected areas aim to protect particular species or habitats and management reflects this priority. Many category IV protected areas will need regular, active interventions to address the requirements of particular species or to maintain habitats, but this is not a requirement of this category. Category V: Protected landscape/seascape protected areas occur where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value. Category VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources are generally large, with much of the area in a more-or-less natural condition and wherea a proportion is under sustainable natural resource management and where such exploitation is seen as one of the main aims of the area.
