00253-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In response to the growing need to understand the response of plant and animal species to environmental variation and climate change and to develop a widespread baseline against which future phenological change may be measured, a consortium of scientists and agencies organized the USA-NPN, with a mandate to collect and share phenology data. More information on the USA-NPN can be found at http://www.usanpn.org/about. As of January 1, 2013, the dataset contains phenology data on 591 species of plants and animals, with 7,512 locations registered across the United States. Protocols used are documented in Denny et. al., Submitted (contact nco@usanpn.org for more information). Data were collected using the phenophase status approach (Thomas et. al., 2010; Denny et. al. Submitted). Latitude and longitude given in WGS84 Datum. This is a suite of yearly data sets (Plants beginning in 2009, Animals beginning in 2010) each provided with and without full phenophase definitions. Supplemental Information: Denny, E.G., K.L. Gerst, A.J. Miller-Rushing, G.L. Tierney, T.M. Crimmins, C.A.F. Enquist, P. Guertin, A.H. Rosemartin, M.D. Schwartz, K.A. Thomas and J.F. Weltzin. Submitted.

Choose a site A site is the area within which you will look for your chosen animal species, and which encompasses any plants you choose to observe. When you select a site, such as your yard or a nearby natural area, consider these guidelines: Convenience: You will be visiting your site(s) regularly, so it should be convenient and easily accessible. Consider your yard or another area that your visit frequently. Representative location: As much as is practical, the selected site(s) should be representative of the environmental conditions for your area. Uniform habitat: The conditions of your selected site(s) should be relatively uniform across the site. If you would like to observe two adjacent but distinct habitats, please document them as separate sites. For example, a wetland adjacent to or surrounded by a drier grassland or forest should be documented as a separate site from the grassland or forest. Appropriate size: A site should be no larger than 15 acres (6 hectares or 250 x 250 meters), a square with sides the length of 2 ½ football fields. A site can certainly be smaller than this, and larger areas can be divided into multiple sites. Proper permission: If you do not own the property where the site is located, you must get permission from the landowner before marking the site, the plants or reporting the site location information (such as latitude/longitude coordinates). You may want to mark your site, so that you can find it again in the future. Select species to observe Select species to observe from the online list of species. https://www.usanpn.org/nn/species_search Make observations and enter them online Print paper datasheets and enter the data online or enter observations directly to smartphone app. Each data record contains the following information: Phenophase status record Each record gives the status of a phenophase for given species (for animals) or individual organism (plants), phenophase, location and day.

Choose a site A site is the area within which you will look for your chosen animal species, and which encompasses any plants you choose to observe. When you select a site, such as your yard or a nearby natural area, consider these guidelines: Convenience: You will be visiting your site(s) regularly, so it should be convenient and easily accessible. Consider your yard or another area that your visit frequently. Representative location: As much as is practical, the selected site(s) should be representative of the environmental conditions for your area. Uniform habitat: The conditions of your selected site(s) should be relatively uniform across the site. If you would like to observe two adjacent but distinct habitats, please document them as separate sites. For example, a wetland adjacent to or surrounded by a drier grassland or forest should be documented as a separate site from the grassland or forest. Appropriate size: A site should be no larger than 15 acres (6 hectares or 250 x 250 meters), a square with sides the length of 2 ½ football fields. A site can certainly be smaller than this, and larger areas can be divided into multiple sites. Proper permission: If you do not own the property where the site is located, you must get permission from the landowner before marking the site, the plants or reporting the site location information (such as latitude/longitude coordinates). You may want to mark your site, so that you can find it again in the future.

More information on the USA-NPN can be found at http://www.usanpn.org/about. As of January 1, 2013, the dataset contains phenology data on 591 species of plants and animals, with 7,512 locations registered across the United States. Protocols used are documented in Denny et. al., Submitted (contact nco@usanpn.org for more information). Data were collected using the phenophase status approach (Thomas et. al., 2010; Denny et. al. Submitted). Latitude and longitude given in WGS84 Datum. This is a suite of yearly data sets (Plants beginning in 2009, Animals beginning in 2010) each provided with and without full phenophase definitions. Supplemental Information: Denny, E.G., K.L.

More information on the USA-NPN can be found at http://www.usanpn.org/about. As of January 1, 2013, the dataset contains phenology data on 591 species of plants and animals, with 7,512 locations registered across the United States. Protocols used are documented in Denny et. al., Submitted (contact nco@usanpn.org for more information). Data were collected using the phenophase status approach (Thomas et. al., 2010; Denny et. al. Submitted). Latitude and longitude given in WGS84 Datum. This is a suite of yearly data sets (Plants beginning in 2009, Animals beginning in 2010) each provided with and without full phenophase definitions. Supplemental Information: Denny, E.G., K.L.

Choose a site A site is the area within which you will look for your chosen animal species, and which encompasses any plants you choose to observe. When you select a site, such as your yard or a nearby natural area, consider these guidelines: Convenience: You will be visiting your site(s) regularly, so it should be convenient and easily accessible. Consider your yard or another area that your visit frequently. Representative location: As much as is practical, the selected site(s) should be representative of the environmental conditions for your area. Uniform habitat: The conditions of your selected site(s) should be relatively uniform across the site. If you would like to observe two adjacent but distinct habitats, please document them as separate sites. For example, a wetland adjacent to or surrounded by a drier grassland or forest should be documented as a separate site from the grassland or forest. Appropriate size: A site should be no larger than 15 acres (6 hectares or 250 x 250 meters), a square with sides the length of 2 ½ football fields. A site can certainly be smaller than this, and larger areas can be divided into multiple sites. Proper permission: If you do not own the property where the site is located, you must get permission from the landowner before marking the site, the plants or reporting the site location information (such as latitude/longitude coordinates). You may want to mark your site, so that you can find it again in the future.

More information on the USA-NPN can be found at http://www.usanpn.org/about. As of January 1, 2013, the dataset contains phenology data on 591 species of plants and animals, with 7,512 locations registered across the United States. Protocols used are documented in Denny et. al., Submitted (contact nco@usanpn.org for more information). Data were collected using the phenophase status approach (Thomas et. al., 2010; Denny et. al. Submitted). Latitude and longitude given in WGS84 Datum. This is a suite of yearly data sets (Plants beginning in 2009, Animals beginning in 2010) each provided with and without full phenophase definitions. Supplemental Information: Denny, E.G., K.L.

00258-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In response to the growing need to understand the response of plant and animal species to environmental variation and climate change and to develop a widespread baseline against which future phenological change may be measured, a consortium of scientists and agencies organized the USA-NPN, with a mandate to collect and share phenology data. More information on the USA-NPN can be found at http://www.usanpn.org/about. As of January 1, 2013, the dataset contains phenology data on 591 species of plants and animals, with 7,512 locations registered across the United States. Protocols used are documented in Denny et. al., Submitted (contact nco@usanpn.org for more information). Data were collected using the phenophase status approach (Thomas et. al., 2010; Denny et. al. Submitted). Latitude and longitude given in WGS84 Datum. This is a suite of yearly data sets (Plants beginning in 2009, Animals beginning in 2010) each provided with and without full phenophase definitions. Supplemental Information: Denny, E.G., K.L.

Focal Species The Species and Protocols Group (S&P) applied a combination of desired criteria and applications to a comprehensive plant database (http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/) and has developed a list of about 150 species, which will be vetted by participating networks and programs. The primary goal of this selection is to establish a baseline of phenological patterns for plants and animals across the nation, help monitor and detect phenological responses to climate change, immediately demonstrate the national scope of network, and engage the largest possible number of participants within a backbone network. x means the species is a focal species Genus The genus to which the species belongs.
