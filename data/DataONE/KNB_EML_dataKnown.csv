00512-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"HYDRO1k is a geographic database developed to provide comprehensive and consistent global coverage of topographically derived data sets, including streams, drainage basins and ancillary layers derived from the USGS' 30 arc-second digital elevation model of the world (GTOPO30). HYDRO1k provides a suite of geo-referenced data sets, both raster and vector, which will be of value for all users who need to organize, evaluate, or process hydrologic information on a continental scale. Developed at the U.S. Geological Survey's EROS Data Center , the HYDRO1k project's goal is to provide to users, on a continent by continent basis, hydrologically correct DEMs along with ancillary data sets for use in continental and regional scale modeling and analyses."

There are five separate datasets, all of which report data extracted from earlier publications. The file contains (i) data that formed the basis for the results presented in the paper, (ii) all data collected as part of the study, including entries with missing or unclear information that were removed before analyses, (iii) data that was collected during a preliminary study, where the variables differ from those in the final dataset, but some studies might appear in both, (iv) and (v) additional data from studies that, while listing individual performance, did not link this to further detail about the individuals."

00516-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"Vegetation Line Point Intercept Data, Owens Valley, CA USA 1984-2013"
00516-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Each year, the Inyo County Water Department monitors vegetation conditions on the floor of the Owens Valley. The primary goal of this monitoring, according to the technical appendix to the Long-Term Water Agreement (Green Book) are to detect any “significant decreases and changes in Owens Valley vegetation from conditions documented in 1984 to 1987”. Vegetation live cover and species composition documented during the 1984-87 mapping effort were adopted as the baseline for comparison with each annual reinventory according to the Agreement. The reference measurements collected within individual areas mapped with similar vegetation (parcels) are referred to as baseline. The Green Book details certain decreases and changes in vegetation community types that must be avoided under the Agreement. Baseline vegetation communities in which evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation were classified as groundwater-dependent communities and are referred to as Types B, C, and D. These phreatophytic communities are dependent on shallow groundwater to maintain plant populations, as precipitation alone is inadequate to meet the water demand of evaporation and transpiration (Sorensen et al. 1991, Steinwand et al. 2006). For these parcels, according to the Green Book, “the goal is to manage groundwater pumping and surface water management practices so as to avoid causing significant decreases in live vegetation cover” and to prevent a significant amount of vegetation from changing to a “vegetation type that precedes it alphabetically (for example, Type D changing to either C, B, or A vegetation).” The goal is to manage the effect of pumping on the depth to groundwater to maintain baseline plant communities. To determine whether significant decreases and/or changes in vegetation have occurred, three criteria need to be met that are described in the Green Book: (1) measurability of vegetation change, (2) attributability of vegetation change to LADWP groundwater pumping or surface water management and (3) degree of significance defined by the magnitude, extent, duration and permanency of the change along with other factors including air quality, human health, impact to species of concern, etc. To avoid confusion, it is noteworthy to highlight that the standard dictionary definition of “measurability” is the degree to which something can be measured. Vegetation of course can be measured and thus the first criteria for determining significant decreases or changes in vegetation may seem to the reader unfamiliar with the Green Book, unnecessary. However, the Green Book assigns a different definition to the term “measurability”—defined in part as a change that is statistically significant. Thus the first criteria, measurability, can be used interchangeably with statistical significance in the context of the technical appendix (Green Book) to the Agreement. A main objective of the vegetation annual report is to evaluate the statistical significance (measurability) of vegetation change compared to baseline. The second criterion, evaluating whether a statistically significant change in vegetation is caused by water management (attributability), is beyond the scope of this report owing to the need for a comprehensive analysis on a case by case basis for each vegetation parcel. Another source of confusion may arise with the third criterion which is the “degree or significance” of environmental change. For this criterion to be met, statistical significance is necessary but not sufficient. As described above, there are several other factors in addition to statistical significance that must be demonstrated to evaluate the degree of significance for the third criterion. For an example of a comprehensive evaluation of all three criteria for an individual parcel, see the report “Analysis of Conditions in Vegetation Parcel Blackrock 94” (available at www.inyowater.org). A large proportion of groundwater-dependent parcels were mapped during baseline as Type C alkali meadows (61%), and the Agreement seeks to prevent these meadows from changing to shrub-dominated communities (Type B), a state change that is associated with increased depth to groundwater. Alkali meadows are of special concern because small increases in depth to groundwater can decouple the groundwater from the root zone of grass species (Naumberg et al. 1996, Elmore et al. 2006). Alkali meadow comprises 0.1% of the vegetation community types in California and 80% of alkali meadow communities are located within the Owens Valley (Davis et al. 1998). Local management of this community type will determine the likelihood these ecosystems persist in a changing environment. Vegetation change across the Owens Valley was evaluated at both the valley scale and for each of 111 individual parcels sampled in 2013. First, at the valley-wide scale we evaluated plant community cover and composition in parcels affected by groundwater pumping and for parcels that were relatively unaffected by groundwater pumping during the period of maximum pumping rate (1987-1993). Second, we assessed whether transpiring vegetative cover differed over time for locations influenced by pumping compared to locations not influenced by groundwater pumping. Third, we quantitatively assessed the divergence of these groups of parcels from the baseline cover values recorded from 1984 to 1987. Fourth, we assessed whether vegetation composition in wellfield or control groups had changed from baseline values. Lastly, since determination of significant impacts attributed to water management by LADWP is made on a case by case basis at the individual parcel scale, we (a) quantified the magnitude of change in perennial vegetation cover over the twenty-three year reinventory period, (b) assessed whether the relative proportion of woody vegetation (hereafter shrub), gramminoid vegetation (hereafter grass) and non-gramminoid herbaceous vegetation (hereafter herb) has changed compared to baseline and (c), quantified the temporal trends of vegetation composition for each parcel and evaluated what environmental factors explained the observed patterns in vegetation change."

Each site was split into distinct zones base on dominant sessile organisms that were characteristic of the zones. The zones are as follows, starting from high to low; High Chthamalus, mid Chthamalus, low Chthamalus, high Colpomenia, and mid Colpomenia. Ten meter transects were run parallel to the waters edge. A total of 31 transects were run, 4 from the High Chthamalus, 5 from the mid Chthamalus, 7 from the low Chthamalus 13 from the high Colpomenia, 2 from the mid Colpomenia. Of the 400 specimens found, 8 species were identified. These species were Ophionereis annulata, Ophiactis simplex, Ophactis savignyi, Ophiocoma aethiops, Ophiocoma alexanderi, Ophioderma panamense, Ophioderma teres, and Ophiothrix spiculata. The following information was recorded for each specimen: o Species o Diameter of disk o Length of arm span o The substrate that it was found on o If they are under a rock, if so how big o If it was found in water o If it is regenerating arms and if so how many o If more then 50% of the regenerating arms were missing Possible paper topics: o Arm regeneration in relation to species, substrate, or disk diameter of each individual. o Density, size, and species abundance as a function of zonation."

00526-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: ECHAM4 B2a Model: 2080 Mean Temperature"
00526-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The ECHAM climate model has been developed from the ECMWF atmospheric model (therefore the first part of its name: EC) and a comprehensive parameterisation package developed at Hamburg therefore the abbreviation HAM) which allows the model to be used for climate simulations. The model is a spectral transform model with 19 atmospheric layers and the results used here derive from experiments performed with spatial resolution T42 (which approximates to about 2.8 degrees longitude/latitude resolution). The model has also been used at resolutions in the range T21 to T106. ECHAM4 is the current generation in the line of ECHAM models (Roeckner, et al., 1992). A summary of developments regarding model physics in ECHAM4 and a description of the simulated climate obtained with the uncoupled ECHAM4 model is given in Roeckner et al. (1996). The initial sea surface temperature and sea-ice data is the COLA/CAC AMIP SST and sea-ice data set. The mean terrain heights are computed from high resolution US Navy data set. The fraction of grid area covered by vegetation based on the Wilson and Henderson-Sellers (1985) data set. The ocean albedo is a function of solar zenith angle and the land albedo from the satellite data of Geleyn and Preuss (1983). A diurnal cycle and gravity wave-drag is included. The time-step of the model is 24 minutes, except for radiation which uses two hours. The ocean model is an updated version of the isopycnal model (OPYC3) developed by Josef Oberhuber (Oberhuber, 1993) at the Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology, Hamburg, Germany. The name OPYC is derived from Ocean and isoPYCnal co-ordinates. The concept to use isopycnals as the vertical co-ordinate system for an OGCM is based on the observation that the interior ocean behaves as a rather conservative fluid. Even over long distances the origin of water masses can be traced back by considering the distribution of active or passive tracers. Treating the ocean as a conservative fluid fails in areas of significant turbulence activity such as the surface boundary layer. A surface mixed-layer is therefore coupled to the interior ocean in order to represent near-surface vertical mixing and to improve the response time-scales to atmospheric forcing which is controlled by the mixed-layer thickness. Since the model is designed for studies on large scales, a sea ice model with rheology is included and serves the purpose of de-coupling the ocean from extreme high-latitude winter conditions and promotes a realistic treatment of the salinity forcing due to melting or freezing sea ice. The experiments from which results are used here are the 1000-year unforced control simulation using the coupled ECHAM4/OPYC3 model and then two climate change simulations. The greenhouse gas only forced experiment (referred to as GGa1) used historical greenhouse gas forcing from 1860 to 1990 followed by a 1 per cent annum increase in radiative forcing from 1990 to 2099. The greenhouse gas and sulphate aerosol forced experiment (referred to as GSa1) used the GGa1 forcing, plus the negative forcing due to sulphate aerosols. This was represented by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading. The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. For 1860 to 1990 the historic sulphate aerosol forcing estimate was used and for 1990 to 2049 the aerosol forcing estimated for the IS92a emissions scenario. The GSa1 experiment did not extend beyond 2049. Fuller details of the ECHAM4/OPYC3 coupled model can befound at the DDC Yellow Pages.Several papers describe results using this version of the model - see Bacher et al. (1998), Oberhuber et al. (1998), Zhang et al. (1998). The climate sensitivity of ECHAM4 is about 2.6 degrees C.The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities.Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability, but the character of this world differs substantially. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity."

00527-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Ascent to high altitude results in hypobaric hypoxia and some individuals will develop Acute Mountain Sickness, which has been shown to be associated with low mean oxyhemoglobin saturation during sleep at high altitude. Previous research has shown that applying increased positive end-expiratory pressure by the use of expiratory valves in a face mask while awake, results in a reduction in AMS symptoms and higher oxyhemoglobin saturation. Therefore, in this research we aimed to compare sleeping oxyhemoglobin saturation and the incidence and severity of Acute Mountain Sickness in seven subjects sleeping for two consecutive nights at 3800m above sea level either using either non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, that delivered positive inspiratory and expiratory airway pressure via a face mask, or sleeping without assisted ventilation. The Lake Louise Score was used on both mornings, within an hour of waking, to assess the presence and severity of Acute Mountain Sickness. We found significant differences in the mean and minimum sleeping oxyhemoglobin saturation and the Lake Louise Score between subjects who used positive pressure ventilation during sleep and those who did not. We also found a significant difference between the mean sleeping SaO2 of those subjects who developed AMS and those who did not on the night spent without positive pressure ventilation. Key words: hypobaric hypoxia, acute mountain sickness, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, Lake Louise Score, sleeping oxyhemoglobin saturation."

00528-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Data presented here are those collected from a survey of Ecology professors at 48 undergraduate institutions to assess the current state of data management education. The following files have been uploaded: Scripts(2): 1. DataCleaning_20120105.R is an R script for cleaning up data prior to analysis. This script removes spaces, substitutes text for codes, removed duplicate schools, and converts questions and answers from the survey into more simple parameter names, without any numbers, spaces, or symbols. This script is heavily annotated to assist the user of the file in understanding what is being done to the data files. The script produces the file cleandata_[date].Rdata, which is called in the file DataTrimming_20120105.R 2. DataTrimming_20120105.R is an R script for trimming extraneous variables not used in final analyses. Some variables are combined as needed and NAs (no answers) are removed. The file is heavily annotated. It produces trimdata_[date].Rdata, which was imported into Excel for summary statistics. Data files (3) 3. AdvancedSpreadsheet_20110526.csv is the output file from the SurveyMonkey online survey tool used for this project. It is a .csv sheet with the complete set of survey data, although some data (e.g., open-ended responses, institution names) are removed to prevent schools and/or instructors from being identifiable. This file is read into DataCleaning_20120105.R for cleaning and editing. 4. VariableRenaming_20110711.csv is called into the DataCleaning_20120105.R script to convert the questions and answers from the survey into simple parameter names, without any numbers, spaces, or symbols. 5. ParamTable.csv is a list of the parameter names used for analysis and the value codes. It can be used to understand outputs from the scripts above (cleandata_[date].Rdata and trimdata_[date].Rdata)."

00528-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Methods Universities and colleges most likely contribute to the teaching of future graduate students in ecology were selected by using the following 3 methods. First, the US News and World Report's 'Best Graduate Schools' website was used to identify the top ten Ecology and Evolutionary Biology graduate schools in the United States in 2010. Second, the website www.PhDs.org was used to collate a list of graduate schools in ecology with high National Research Council (NRC) Quality Measures. The NRC Quality Measure was set to priority five out of a possible five with all other priorities set to zero (not considered). Third, the same method as method two was used, except that the priority was set to five for Research Quality of the institution. And lastly, we obtained a list of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship recipients for 2006 to 2010 for the life sciences. We removed the following areas of study: biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, computational biology, developmental biology, genetics, immunology, molecular biology, neurosciences, and nutrition. The number of awards per institution were tallied and the Carnegie Classification system was used to determine whether schools were Research Universities (RU) or Baccalaureate/Arts and Sciences (BAS) institutions. BAS institutions with more than 4 awards were used in the survey. Based on these methods, a list of 51 target institutions were generated for the survey. Each institution's website was extensively searched to determine which course(s) were applicable for the survey. Fit was determined subjectively based on the course description, course requirements for ecology-related majors, and the academic department(s) housing the course. After the most appropriate course was identified, the department was contacted to verify that the course selected was appropriate for the survey. The person contacted was the department chair, the undergraduate course advisor, or a professor within the department. The survey consisted of 33 questions that fell into four categories: (1) basic course characteristics, such as class size, laboratory components, reading materials, and prerequisites; (2) the extent to which data management is covered and use of data in the course; (3) instructor opinion about the importance of data management education for undergraduates and perceived barriers to teaching topics related to data management; and (4) instructor characteristics, including year of PhD, percentage of time teaching versus conducting research, and data sharing practices. The survey was conducted online using Survey Monkey. Emails to instructors were sent out 29 March 2011 and the survey was closed 25 May 2011."

First, the US News and World Report's 'Best Graduate Schools' website was used to identify the top ten Ecology and Evolutionary Biology graduate schools in the United States in 2010. Second, the website www.PhDs.org was used to collate a list of graduate schools in ecology with high National Research Council (NRC) Quality Measures. The NRC Quality Measure was set to priority five out of a possible five with all other priorities set to zero (not considered). Third, the same method as method two was used, except that the priority was set to five for Research Quality of the institution. And lastly, we obtained a list of the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship recipients for 2006 to 2010 for the life sciences. We removed the following areas of study: biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, computational biology, developmental biology, genetics, immunology, molecular biology, neurosciences, and nutrition. The number of awards per institution were tallied and the Carnegie Classification system was used to determine whether schools were Research Universities (RU) or Baccalaureate/Arts and Sciences (BAS) institutions. BAS institutions with more than 4 awards were used in the survey. Based on these methods, a list of 51 target institutions were generated for the survey. Each institution's website was extensively searched to determine which course(s) were applicable for the survey. Fit was determined subjectively based on the course description, course requirements for ecology-related majors, and the academic department(s) housing the course. After the most appropriate course was identified, the department was contacted to verify that the course selected was appropriate for the survey. The person contacted was the department chair, the undergraduate course advisor, or a professor within the department. The survey consisted of 33 questions that fell into four categories: (1) basic course characteristics, such as class size, laboratory components, reading materials, and prerequisites; (2) the extent to which data management is covered and use of data in the course; (3) instructor opinion about the importance of data management education for undergraduates and perceived barriers to teaching topics related to data management; and (4) instructor characteristics, including year of PhD, percentage of time teaching versus conducting research, and data sharing practices. The survey was conducted online using Survey Monkey. Emails to instructors were sent out 29 March 2011 and the survey was closed 25 May 2011."

Each record (n greater than 30,000) of the main table includes the following fields: date; time; daily record sequence; group type; location (by 1 km grid square and since 2000 by GPS UTM coordinate); habitat type at beginning and end of observation; group size; number of bulls; quality of the count; bull age classes; presence of musth males; presence of estrous females; activity of group; ID of observer; quality of individual recognition of females and males. Linked tables include: individual IDs; family IDs; habitat types; activity types; observer IDs. Ancillary databases include demography (dates of births, deaths, cause of death); rainfall (since 1972); watertable (since 1984); 10 vegetation plots; behavioral postures; digital photo IDs; vocalizations. Since 2002 a GIS database (in ArcInfo) has been maintained incorporating ca. 100 geographical, geo-physical, hydrological, vegetation and elephant distribution layers."

00533-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: CGCM1 B2a Model: 2020 Minimum Temperature"
00533-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The first version of the Canadian Global Coupled Model, CGCM1, and its control climate are described by Flato et al. (1999). The atmospheric component of the model is essentially GCMII described by McFarlane et al. (1992). It is a spectral model with triangular truncation at wave number 32 (yielding a surface grid resolution of roughly 3.7 degrees x3.7 degrees ) and 10 vertical levels. The ocean component is based on the GFDL MOM1.1 code and has a resolution of approximately 1.8 degrees x1.8 degrees and 29 vertical levels. The model uses heat and water flux adjustments obtained from uncoupled ocean and atmosphere model runs (of 10 years and 4000 years duration respectively), followed by an `adaption' procedure in which the flux adjustment fields are modified by a 14 year integration of the coupled model. A multi-century control simulation with the coupled model has been performed using the present-day CO2 concentration to evaluate the stability of the coupled model's climate, and to compare the modelled climate and its variability to that observed. An ensemble of four transient climate change simulations has been performed and is described in Boer et al. (1999a; b). Three of these simulations use an effective greenhouse gas forcing change corresponding to that observed from 1850 to the present, and a forcing change corresponding to an increase of CO2 at a rate of 1% per year (compounded) thereafter until year 2100. The direct forcing effect of sulphate aerosols is also included by increasing the surface albedo (as in Reader and Boer, 1999) based on loadings from the sulphur cycle model of Langner and Rodhe (1991). The fourth simulation considers the effect of greenhouse gas forcing only. The change in climate predicted by a model clearly depends directly on this specification of greenhouse gas (and aerosol) forcing, and of course these are not well known. The prescription described above is similar to the IPCC 'business as usual' scenario, and using a standard scenario allows the results of this model to be compared to those of other modelling groups around the world. Some initial results from these simulations are presented below. The climate sensitivity of CGCM1 is about 3.5 degrees C.From the IPCC website: The B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R& continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

00535-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Observations of the presence / absence of jellyfish (Catostylus mosaicus) were recorded during the routine Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program conducted by the Queensland Department of Environment and Resource Management. More than 200 estuarine and coastal sites are monitored monthly for water quality (including chlorophyll, nutrients, turbidity (secchi depth and NTU), salinity, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen) within southeast Queensland. At each site the presence or absence of jellyfish was recorded. Sites where salinity <15ppt were removed from the data set as jellyfish are unlikely to occur in low salinity water."

00539-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: HADCM3 A2b Model: 2020 Precipitation"
00539-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CThe A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards ncreased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 andB1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099, mean and monthly change fields."

00540-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes aboveground macrophyte production (MAG; 1980-1989) data, collected as part of the vegetation section of MERP. Determination of aquatic macrophyte annual net primary production is vital to the understanding of the dynamics of freshwater marshes. Macrophyte biomass, both live and dead, is a major storage compartment for carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in a marsh and a major potential energy and nutrient source for the faunal component of the marsh ecosystem. Macrophyte communities are also essential structural components of the habitat of both invertebrates and vertebrates. The major objective of the long-term monitoring of aquatic macrophytes was to determine the impact of the wet-dry cycle on macrophyte above and belowground net annual production. Standard harvest techniques were used because they were the most direct, simple and reliable techniques available for estimating net annual primary production of macrophytes per unit area (van der Valk, 1989).

00540-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Aboveground Macrophyte Production data (1980-1989) methods Sampling for aboveground macrophyte production occurred once in late July or early August during the sampling season, as this is the period where standing emergents reach their maximum standing crop. The appearance of fully-grown Typha sp. was generally used to gauge if macrophytes had reached their maximum standing crop. Clip plot (MAGs) were one set of methods used to estimate aboveground production (van der Valk, 1989). Four randomly selected sample sites were determined on each of the 10 transects in all 12 cells each year, while respecting a 10m buffer zone around the perimeter of each cell, for a total of 480 clip quadrats. The sites were numbered consecutively from the northeast to the southwest corner of each cell. At each site, depending on species present, a 1 x 1 m (Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, or Scirpus spp.) or a ¼ x ¼ m (all other, smaller species) quadrat was used to clip the plots. Not all MAG sites from each cell were sampled at once; transects were grouped into pairs (1&2, 3&4, 5&6, 7&8, and 9&10) and then each transect pair from each cell was randomly assigned a number from 1-60 and then sampled in that order (van der Valk, 1989). At dry sites, all live and dead standing vegetation was clipped. All specimens of the five dominant emergent species (i.e. Scholochloa festucacea, Typha spp., Phragmites australis, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, and Carex atherodes; for the 1988 sampling year only, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani was added as a sixth dominant emergent) were separated. If there were other species present at the sites with greater than 25% cover, they as well were separated by species. Species present with cover of less than 25% were combined and labeled ‘minor species’. All five major species, any other dominant species (i.e. greater than 25% cover) and the ‘minor species’ group were also separated into live and dead fractions. From 1980-82, the % cover of each species present at the site was recorded in the field book. Burlap and paper bags were used to hold the samples and bring them back to the laboratory. Where there was water present, water depth was recorded starting in 1981. If submerged aquatic macrophytes were present, they were sampled by cutting along the edge of the quadrat and scooped into the sample bags. Filamentous algae was also sampled and separated from the other species present. The samples were dried to constant weight at 80 ºC and weighed. Select samples were then ground using a Wiley mill and then sent to the Freshwater Institute (1980-1984) or Iowa State University (1985-1989) for nutrient analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus (van der Valk 1989). Notes on reading the data: please note: -missing values (sample lost, equiptment malfunction, recording failure) in respective columns are represented by having two consecutive commas occur within the sample row. --For aboveground (i.e. clip plots, mag) macrophyte sampling, previously separate nutrient (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon concentrations) and sample vegetation data (i.e. water level, species code, live or dead, etc.) computer files were merged into one data file for archiving purposes. Nutrient data was associated to its respective sample vegetation data using the ground number. An artifact of this merging process, however, is there were cases where nutrient data did not have a corresponding match (i.e. by ground number) in sample vegetation data, or that the corresponding ground number to nutrient data had been lost. This has created nutrient ‘orphans’ (i.e. nutrient data with no corresponding information on sample vegetation) at the end of each sampling year in the data files. A potential source for this artifact is an error in the recording of ground numbers. However, the data was retained in the combined datafiles to increase the accuracy of a yearly cumulative nutrient estimation. References: van der Valk, A. 1989. Macrophyte production.

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

The appearance of fully-grown Typha sp. was generally used to gauge if macrophytes had reached their maximum standing crop. Clip plot (MAGs) were one set of methods used to estimate aboveground production (van der Valk, 1989). Four randomly selected sample sites were determined on each of the 10 transects in all 12 cells each year, while respecting a 10m buffer zone around the perimeter of each cell, for a total of 480 clip quadrats. The sites were numbered consecutively from the northeast to the southwest corner of each cell. At each site, depending on species present, a 1 x 1 m (Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, or Scirpus spp.) or a ¼ x ¼ m (all other, smaller species) quadrat was used to clip the plots. Not all MAG sites from each cell were sampled at once; transects were grouped into pairs (1&2, 3&4, 5&6, 7&8, and 9&10) and then each transect pair from each cell was randomly assigned a number from 1-60 and then sampled in that order (van der Valk, 1989). At dry sites, all live and dead standing vegetation was clipped. All specimens of the five dominant emergent species (i.e. Scholochloa festucacea, Typha spp., Phragmites australis, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, and Carex atherodes; for the 1988 sampling year only, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani was added as a sixth dominant emergent) were separated. If there were other species present at the sites with greater than 25% cover, they as well were separated by species. Species present with cover of less than 25% were combined and labeled ‘minor species’. All five major species, any other dominant species (i.e. greater than 25% cover) and the ‘minor species’ group were also separated into live and dead fractions. From 1980-82, the % cover of each species present at the site was recorded in the field book. Burlap and paper bags were used to hold the samples and bring them back to the laboratory. Where there was water present, water depth was recorded starting in 1981. If submerged aquatic macrophytes were present, they were sampled by cutting along the edge of the quadrat and scooped into the sample bags. Filamentous algae was also sampled and separated from the other species present. The samples were dried to constant weight at 80 ºC and weighed. Select samples were then ground using a Wiley mill and then sent to the Freshwater Institute (1980-1984) or Iowa State University (1985-1989) for nutrient analysis of nitrogen, carbon and phosphorus (van der Valk 1989). Notes on reading the data: please note: -missing values (sample lost, equiptment malfunction, recording failure) in respective columns are represented by having two consecutive commas occur within the sample row. --For aboveground (i.e. clip plots, mag) macrophyte sampling, previously separate nutrient (i.e. nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon concentrations) and sample vegetation data (i.e. water level, species code, live or dead, etc.) computer files were merged into one data file for archiving purposes. Nutrient data was associated to its respective sample vegetation data using the ground number. An artifact of this merging process, however, is there were cases where nutrient data did not have a corresponding match (i.e. by ground number) in sample vegetation data, or that the corresponding ground number to nutrient data had been lost. This has created nutrient ‘orphans’ (i.e. nutrient data with no corresponding information on sample vegetation) at the end of each sampling year in the data files. A potential source for this artifact is an error in the recording of ground numbers. However, the data was retained in the combined datafiles to increase the accuracy of a yearly cumulative nutrient estimation. References: van der Valk, A. 1989. Macrophyte production.

Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

00541-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The file contains perennial grass basal cover and shrub foliar cover data collected for USFS Study FSRM 1706-12. A copy of the Study Plan may be downloaded from the web site. Measurements were taken on 20 randomly located permanent 100-ft. line transects in each of five pastures. The pastures had been grazed yearlong by cow-calf herds since 1915; utilization ranged from 47-60%. Two changes in grazing management were instituted at the start of the study period: 1) The utilization objective was lowered to 40%, and 2) Summer deferment (July-Sept) in alternate years began in 1958 in two pastures and in 1959 in the other two. Pasture 9 continued to be grazed yearlong and was measured in 1958 and 1963-1966 for comparative purposes. Data from pasture 9 were not included in published analyses. Mesquites (Prosopis velutina) in pastures 1 and 7 were killed with diesel oil between 1954 and 1957. Mesquites in pastures 8, 9, and 10 were left untreated. Cover was measured annually in late summer from 1957-1966 (except 1960) in units of 0.01 ft. Perennial grass was recorded as basal intercept; i.e., length of live root crown portion of tuft at ground level. Shrub cover was recorded as the entire live crown intercept excluding conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown. Taxa were recorded separately to the species level in most cases and sometimes to the genus level only. The OTHERPG code refers to unidentified perennial grass species; OTHSHRUB to unidentified shrub species. Sources of data were the original field data sheets except: Sources for pasture 1 in 1961-1966 were handwritten summaries that had been compiled from the field data sheets. A value of -9999 in a field means that no data were available because a reading was not made for that date."

00541-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Line Transects 2. Line transects.--Line transect measurements will provide data primarily for variable 3. Line transect data will be recorded on the regular Santa Rita line transect record form (page 12a [not included in digital file]). For each grass tuft or shrub intercepted, both the distance from 0 (zero) and the length of intercept will be record. In laying out permanent line transects the tape is placed against the right hand side of the stakes as the observer stands at the 0 (zero) end and looks toward the other end of the line. The 0 (zero) mark of the tape is placed at the 0 (zero) stake. The tape is then stretched as close as possible to the ground in a straight line from the 0 (zero) stake to the outer stake. On 100-ft lines it is helpful to put intermediate stakes at the 33- and 67-ft marks, or at 25, 50, and 75 feet to aid in re-establishing the line. Where intermediate stakes are used the tape is placed against the right hand side of all stakes. After the tape is pulled straight and fastened at both ends the vertical intercept of perennial vegetation is measured and recorded. In the following instructions the letter in parenthesis refers to a longhand letter on the attached sample 'line transect record'. Each item letter is followed in order by the item name as it appears on the form, then by underscored words indicating the kind of data to be entered and finally by the explanation of what is to be recorded and how. Data to be Recorded on the 'Line Transect Record' (Identification Data) (a) Study-title.--Enter brief title of study or project (b) Pasture-number.--Enter number of pasture in which transect is located. Plot 'number' or 'none'.--Enter number of plot on which transect occurs, or if there is no plot number involved enter the word 'none'. (d) Transect-number.--Enter number of transect. (e) Date-day-month-year.--Enter date of observation listing day first, month second, and year third. (f) By-initials.--Enter initials of observers. Record initials of observer first, recorder second. (Data on Perennial Grasses) (h) Intercept (.01 ft.)-lengths of intercepts.--Enter as a whole number length of each intercept in 0.01 ft. Each species is to be recorded separately opposite the proper symbol. Separate individual measurements by dashes. The intercept of perennial grasses is measured at the ground line. Only the live rooted portion of the tuft is measured. The smallest unit of measurement is 0.01 ft. (I) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total by species.--Record total intercept for each species. (j) Grass species-symbol.--Enter species symbol for any perennial grass that intercepts the line and whose symbol is not listed on the form. (k) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total all spp.--Compute and record total intercept of all perennial grasses. (Data on Shrubs) (m) Intercept (.01 ft.)-lengths of intercepts.--Record length (in .01 ft.) of live crown intercept as a whole number. Measure entire live crown intercept but do not include conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown. (n) Intercept (.01 ft.)-totals by spp.--Enter total intercept for each shrub species. (o) Shrubs-symbol.--Record symbols for species that are intercepted but not listed. (p) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total all spp.--Enter total intercept for all shrub species. Line transect data will be taken in 1957, 1958, and 1959, and in 1964, 1965, and 1966, preferable in late August or early September. Cover was measured annually in late summer from 1957-1966 (except 1960) in units of 0.01 ft. Perennial grass was recorded as basal intercept; i.e., length of live root crown portion of tuft at ground level. Shrub cover was recorded as the entire live crown intercept excluding conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown. Taxa were recorded separately to the species level in most cases and sometimes to the genus level only. The OTHERPG code refers to unidentified perennial grass species; OTHSHRUB to unidentified shrub species. The pastures had been grazed yearlong by cow-calf herds since 1915; utilization ranged from 47-60%. Two changes in grazing management were instituted at the start of the study period: 1) The utilization objective was lowered to 40%, and 2) Summer deferment (July-Sept) in alternate years began in 1958 in two pastures and in 1959 in the other two. Pasture 9 continued to be grazed yearlong and was measured in 1958 and 1963-1966 for comparative purposes. Data from pasture 9 were not included in published analyses. C. Treatments The major treatments affecting vegetation and livestock are mesquite control and grazing management. 1. Mesquite control.--The mesquite-control treatment will consist of killing all mesquite in pastures 1 and 7 with diesel oil but leaving the mesquite alone in pastures 8, 9, and 10. 2. Grazing management.--All pastures will be grazed on a flexible basis. Each pasture will be deferred during the growing season (July-Sept.) In alternate years. Cattle numbers will be adjusted each fall in accordance with the production of perennial grasses. The average utilization objective for perennial grasses will be 40 percent. Actual use may range from 30 to 50 percent."

00541-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Line Transects 2. Line transects.--Line transect measurements will provide data primarily for variable 3. Line transect data will be recorded on the regular Santa Rita line transect record form (page 12a [not included in digital file]). For each grass tuft or shrub intercepted, both the distance from 0 (zero) and the length of intercept will be record. In laying out permanent line transects the tape is placed against the right hand side of the stakes as the observer stands at the 0 (zero) end and looks toward the other end of the line. The 0 (zero) mark of the tape is placed at the 0 (zero) stake. The tape is then stretched as close as possible to the ground in a straight line from the 0 (zero) stake to the outer stake. On 100-ft lines it is helpful to put intermediate stakes at the 33- and 67-ft marks, or at 25, 50, and 75 feet to aid in re-establishing the line. Where intermediate stakes are used the tape is placed against the right hand side of all stakes. After the tape is pulled straight and fastened at both ends the vertical intercept of perennial vegetation is measured and recorded. In the following instructions the letter in parenthesis refers to a longhand letter on the attached sample 'line transect record'. Each item letter is followed in order by the item name as it appears on the form, then by underscored words indicating the kind of data to be entered and finally by the explanation of what is to be recorded and how. Data to be Recorded on the 'Line Transect Record' (Identification Data) (a) Study-title.--Enter brief title of study or project (b) Pasture-number.--Enter number of pasture in which transect is located. Plot 'number' or 'none'.--Enter number of plot on which transect occurs, or if there is no plot number involved enter the word 'none'. (d) Transect-number.--Enter number of transect. (e) Date-day-month-year.--Enter date of observation listing day first, month second, and year third. (f) By-initials.--Enter initials of observers. Record initials of observer first, recorder second. (Data on Perennial Grasses) (h) Intercept (.01 ft.)-lengths of intercepts.--Enter as a whole number length of each intercept in 0.01 ft. Each species is to be recorded separately opposite the proper symbol. Separate individual measurements by dashes. The intercept of perennial grasses is measured at the ground line. Only the live rooted portion of the tuft is measured. The smallest unit of measurement is 0.01 ft. (I) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total by species.--Record total intercept for each species. (j) Grass species-symbol.--Enter species symbol for any perennial grass that intercepts the line and whose symbol is not listed on the form. (k) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total all spp.--Compute and record total intercept of all perennial grasses. (Data on Shrubs) (m) Intercept (.01 ft.)-lengths of intercepts.--Record length (in .01 ft.) of live crown intercept as a whole number. Measure entire live crown intercept but do not include conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown. (n) Intercept (.01 ft.)-totals by spp.--Enter total intercept for each shrub species. (o) Shrubs-symbol.--Record symbols for species that are intercepted but not listed. (p) Intercept (.01 ft.)-total all spp.--Enter total intercept for all shrub species. Line transect data will be taken in 1957, 1958, and 1959, and in 1964, 1965, and 1966, preferable in late August or early September. Cover was measured annually in late summer from 1957-1966 (except 1960) in units of 0.01 ft. Perennial grass was recorded as basal intercept; i.e., length of live root crown portion of tuft at ground level. Shrub cover was recorded as the entire live crown intercept excluding conspicuous openings or areas of dead crown. Taxa were recorded separately to the species level in most cases and sometimes to the genus level only. The OTHERPG code refers to unidentified perennial grass species; OTHSHRUB to unidentified shrub species. The pastures had been grazed yearlong by cow-calf herds since 1915; utilization ranged from 47-60%. Two changes in grazing management were instituted at the start of the study period: 1) The utilization objective was lowered to 40%, and 2) Summer deferment (July-Sept) in alternate years began in 1958 in two pastures and in 1959 in the other two. Pasture 9 continued to be grazed yearlong and was measured in 1958 and 1963-1966 for comparative purposes. Data from pasture 9 were not included in published analyses. C. Treatments The major treatments affecting vegetation and livestock are mesquite control and grazing management. 1. Mesquite control.--The mesquite-control treatment will consist of killing all mesquite in pastures 1 and 7 with diesel oil but leaving the mesquite alone in pastures 8, 9, and 10. 2. Grazing management.--All pastures will be grazed on a flexible basis. Each pasture will be deferred during the growing season (July-Sept.) In alternate years. Cattle numbers will be adjusted each fall in accordance with the production of perennial grasses. The average utilization objective for perennial grasses will be 40 percent. Actual use may range from 30 to 50 percent."

00546-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Three projects neared completion during 1980-8l: Steroid saponins, chemicals which are thought to elicit defensive behavior by many marine invertebrates, were isolated directly from seawater surrounding living specimens of two species of seastar, Pycnopodia helianthoides and Patiria miniata. The total amount of saponin released by equal wet weights of these two seastars is similar, but structural details of specific saponins may differ. Two other projects dealt with the defensive responses of certain prey to predators. One of these (with Marina Chiarappa) investigated the defensive responses of limpets to predatory flatworms. The other project was an investigation of the responses of two stenotopic limpets, Collisella instabilis and Notoacmea insessa, two seastar predators. In addition to the research described above revision of Between Pacific Tides has begun. Numerous photographs and collections will be taken at BML to support this work."

Contaminants can also be imported to the Estuary from upstream sources. As a rule-of-thumb, water travels approximately 50 km (30 miles) in a day. Therefore I delineated a drainage area that extends 50 km upstream from the boundary of the subregions (or until reaching the watershed divide where streams drain the western slope of the Coast Ranges directly into San Francisco Bay. This buffer area does not overlap with or include the hydrodynamic subregions."

00554-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The data originates from national monitoring on the effects of the Finnish agri-environment support scheme (MYTVAS). In 1999, 2000 and 2004, data on vascular plants was collected in 36 mesic semi-natural grasslands, representing different management types: 1) continuous seasonal cattle grazing, 2) cattle grazing resumed 3–8 years ago after over 10 years of abandonment, and 3) overgrowing, abandoned over 10 years ago. Each grassland was studied in 1999 or 2000 and the second time in 2004. The study sites were situated in southwestern Finland on mainly southwestern and southeastern slopes by small rivers and brooks on clay soil. All study sites were open grassland without trees and shrubs. The new and most of the old pastures were under the EU agri-environmental scheme of management of traditional rural biotopes. Coverages of vascular plants were estimated on 15 1 m2 plots randomly placed per study area. Additionally, in 1999, all plant species of the whole study area were recorded; in 2000 and 2004, coverages of plant species in the whole study area were estimated using a nine-class scale (1<0.125 %, 2=0.125-0.5 %, 3=0.5-2 %, 4=2-4 %, 5=4-8 %, 6=8-16 %, 7=16-32 %, 8=32-64 %, 9>64 %).

00555-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Project goals: The goal of this project is to establish a network of research plots in woody vegetation of Sonoma County, California (in the North Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area). The objective of plot installation is to assess species distributions and community structure along abiotic gradients and to serve as a baseline for long-term studies of vegetation dynamics in response to climate change and other drivers. This field study is integrated with ongoing monitoring of weather and climate and was designed relative to downscaled projections of future climate and water balance and projected vegetation change through the end of the 21st century. Primary objectives: 1. To examine woodland vegetation community structure and species composition across fine-scale topographic and hydrologic gradients, providing a baseline for monitoring long-term change. 2. With additional focus on: - The effects of plot orientation to marine layer, aspect, topographic position - Distribution and possible hybridization between blue and Oregon oak, closely related species with overlapping geographic range at Pepperwood Preserve - Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) succession and effects of removal for oak woodland management 3. To create an infrastructure for future projects studying ecology and species interactions in woody plant communities occurring on contrasting topographic and hydrologic gradients. Why this is important: Woodland and forest vegetation represents critical habitat in natural communities of the Bay Area, supporting a wide diversity of plant and animal species. A range of ecological processes can lead to vegetation change in these communities, including ecological succession, disease (e.g. sudden oak death), invasive species, changes in herbivore community, and wildfire. In the 21st century, rapid climate change is also expected to cause dramatic impacts on native plant communities. Climate will interact with the processes above, and may also cause direct impacts via drought, heat waves, etc. Detecting the impacts of climate change on vegetation requires long-term research, with quantitative baseline data and repeated resurveys. This projected established a network of permanent plots for longterm monitoring and demographic research on climate change and the interaction with other factors that may impact native vegetation. Project overview: Fifty 20 x 20 m plots were established across topographic and hydrologic gradients throughout the preserve. Within each plot all saplings (>50 cm tall) and trees (> 1 cm diameter at breast height) were permanently tagged, identified, mapped and measured. All seedlings (<10 cm tall) and juveniles (10-50 cm tall) were counted and identified. Micrometeorological monitoring was initiated, and will be expanded in the future. Project impact: This project supported the development and implementation of a woody vegetation monitoring and research study as a baseline for long-term study of vegetation change at Pepperwood Preserve, and a foundational model for future studies across the Bay Area. An outcome of the project is to apply results and lessons learned to vegetation management priorities of the Conservation Lands Network in the San Francisco Bay Area. Some of the outcomes will not be realized until we re-census the research plots (proposed 5 years re-census), while others can be developed immediately based on baseline data, such as the influence of topographical heterogeneity on community diversity at local scales.

00556-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: NIES99 A1a Model: 2020 Precipitation"
00556-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in this storyline from 'conservation' of nature to active'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

All previous hatchery rearing that was successful used Bristol Bay broodstock. We reared red king larvae from both Juneau and Bristol Bay using identical conditions to determine if broodstock origin influences success of hatchery production. Larvae were collected from at least three females from each stock and mixed randomly. Larvae were stocked at densities of 50 larvae L-1 in eight 1200 L tanks at 10°C. Four tanks contained Bristol Bay larvae and four tanks contained Juneau larvae. All tanks were fed SFB Artemia enriched with DC DHA Selco (Inve Aquaculture). Survival to the first juvenile stage was 15%. There was no significant difference in survival to the glaucothoe stage between stocks."

00561-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: CSIRO B1a Model: 2080 Radiation"
00561-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997). The central elements of the B1 future are a high level of environmental and social consciousness combined with a globally coherent approach to sustainable development. A strong welfare net prevents social exclusion on the basis of poverty. However, counter-currents may develop and in some places people may not conform to the main social and environmental intentions of the mainstream in this scenario family. Particular effort is devoted to increasing resource efficiency. Comprehensive incentive systems, combined with advances in international institutions, permit the rapid diffusion of cleaner technology. R and D to this end is also enhanced together with education and capacity building for clean and equitable development. Organizational measures are adopted to reduce material wastage, maximizing reuse and recycling. The combination of technical and organizational change yields high levels of material and energy saving as well as reductions in pollution. Labor productivity also improves as a byproduct of these efforts. Variants considered within the B1 family of scenarios include different rates of GDP growth and dematerialization (e.g., energy intensity declines). The demographic transition to low mortality and fertility occurs at the same rate as in A1 but for slightly different reasons, motivated partly by social and environmental concerns. Global population reaches nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. This is a world with high levels of economic activity and significant and deliberate progress toward international and national income equality. Global income per capita in 2050 averages US$13,000; somewhat lower than in A1. A higher proportion of this income is spent on services rather than on material goods, and on quality rather than quantity, because of less emphasis on material goods and also higher resource prices. The B1 storyline sees a relatively smooth transition to alternative energy systems as conventional oil resources decline. There is extensive use of conventional and unconventional gas as the cleanest fossil resource during the transition, but the major push is towards post fossil technologies driven in large part by environmental concerns. Given the high environmental consciousness and institutional effectiveness in the B1 storyline, environmental quality is high, as most potentially negative environmental aspects of rapid development are anticipated and dealt with effectively locally, nationally, and internationally. For example, transboundary air pollution (acid rain) is basically eliminated in the long-term. Land-use is carefully managed to counteract the impacts of activities potentially damaging to the environment. Cities are compact and designed for public and non-motorized transport, with suburban developments tightly controlled. Strong incentives for low-input, low-impact agriculture along with maintenance of large areas of wilderness contribute to high food prices with much lower levels of meat consumption than those in A1. These proactive local and regional environmental measures and policies also lead to relatively low GHG emissions even in the absence of explicit interventions directed at mitigating climate change."

00566-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: NIES99 A2a Model: 2080 Maximum Temperature"
00566-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The model used here is a coupled ocean-atmosphere model that consists of the CCSR/NIES atmospheric GCM, the CCSR ocean GCM, a thermodynamic sea-ice model, and a river routing model (Abe-Ouchi et al., 1996). The spatial resolution is T21 spectral truncation (roughly 5.6 degrees latitude/longitude) and 20 vertical levels for the atmospheric part, and roughly 2.8 degrees horizontal grid and 17 vertical levels for the oceanic part. Flux adjustment for atmosphere-ocean heat and water exchange is applied to prevent a drift of the modelled climate. The atmospheric model adopts a radiation scheme based on the k-distribution, two-stream discrete ordinate method (DOM) (Nakajima and Tanaka, 1986). This scheme can deal with absorption, emission and scattering by gases, clouds and aerosol particles in a consistent manner. In the calculation of sulphate aerosol optical properties, the volumetric mode radius of the sulphate particle in dry environment is assumed to be 0.2 micron. The hygroscopic growth of the sulphate is considered by an empirical fit of d'Almeida et al. (1991). The vertical distribution of the sulphate aerosol is assumed to be constant in the lowest 2 km of the atmosphere. The concentrations of greenhouse gases are represented by equivalent-CO2. Three integrations are made for 200 model years (1890-2090). In the control experiment (CTL), the globally uniform concentration of greenhouse gases is kept constant at 345 ppmv CO2-equivalent and the concentration of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiment GG, the concentration of greenhouse gases is gradually increased, while that of sulphate is set to zero. In the experiments GS, the increase in anthropogenic sulphate as well as that in greenhouse gases is given and the aerosol scattering (the direct effect of aerosol) is explicitly represented in the way described above. The indirect effect of aerosol is not included in any experiment. The scenario of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and sulphate aerosols is given in accordance with Mitchell and Johns (1997). The increase in greenhouse gases is based on the historical record from 1890 to 1990 and is increased by 1 percent / yr (compound) after 1990. For sulphate aerosols, geographical distributions of sulphate loading for 1986 and 2050, which are estimated by a sulphur cycle model (Langer and Rodhe, 1991), are used as basic patterns. Based on global and annual mean sulphur emission rates, the 1986 pattern is scaled for years before 1990; the 2050 pattern is scaled for years after 2050; and the pattern is interpolated from the two basic ones for intermediate years to give the time series of the distribution. The sulphur emission rate in the future is based on the IPCC IS92a scenario. The sulphate concentration is offset in our run so that it starts from zero at 1890. The seasonal variation of sulphate concentration is ignored. Discussion on the results of the experiments will be found in Emori et al. (1999). Climate sensitivity of the CCSR/NIES model derived by equilibrium runs is estimated to be 3.5 degrees Celsius. Global-Mean Temperature, Precipitation and CO2 Changes (w.r.t. 1961-90) for the CCSR/NIES model.For the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a 'return to family values' in many regions. The A2 world 'consolidates' into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100. Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies. With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture. Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families."

00569-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: HADCM3 A1F Model: 2080 Wind Speed"
00569-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CThe A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in this storyline from 'conservation' of nature to active'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

In 2010 - 2011, soil quality of agricultural fields under different cultivation methods were studied in south and southwestern Finland. Farm selection was done with the help of two regional projects for environmental protection of agriculture: RaHa-project in Uusimaa region and TEHO-project in Varsinais-Suomi and Satakunta regions. Within each farm group there were four different tillage intensities performed: ploughed, permanent / long-term grass, mouldboard ploughed and direct drilling (no-till). Data set is not yet ready. Chemical analysis will be performed during winter 2011 - 2012."

00573-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Low-Volume Filter Pack Air Chemistry Data Aerosol concentrations, HNO3 and SO2 were sampled using Teflon filter packs. Three 47- mm diameter filters were placed in each filter pack: a Teflon filter (1988-February 2004 Zefluor, 2 micron, Gelman Sciences, Inc.; February 2004-present Whatman, 1 micron) for collection of aerosols, a Nylasorb 1 micron nylon filter (Gelman Sciences, Inc.) for collection of HNO3 vapor and a potassium carbonate-coated cellulose filter for collection of SO2. The cellulose filters were Whatman 41, >20-25 Ã¯Â¿Â½m particle retention, coarse porosity, ASTM, 12 sec, (Whatman number 1441-047). The cellulose filters were cleaned before coating by rinsing and soaking overnight in double-deionized water. The three filters were placed in line so that the Teflon filter was exposed to incoming ambient air first, the nylon filter second and the carbonate filter last. The filter packs were placed in an inverted stainless steel pot (from 1988 - July 1993 it was an inverted plastic funnel) on a tower approximately 10 m above a mowed grass surface. A continuous flow of air was drawn through the filter pack at 3.00 lpm using a Gast, Inc. oil-less vacuum pump (model 1031, upgraded to model 1531-107B-6288 in 1998), which was regulated by a mass flow controller (Tylan General Inc., model FC280V, upgraded to model FC2604S in 1998 and to Aalborg model GFC 17 in September 2002). When the mass flow controller was off line for any reason, either a needle valve or another mass flow controller regulated flow. During this time, flow was measured using a rotameter (Gilmont Instruments, Inc., or SciencewareÃ¯Â¿Â½), and the flow measurements were corrected for instantaneous temperature and atmospheric pressure. Clean filter packs were exchanged for exposed ones every Tuesday. The Teflon filters were extracted in 50 ml of double deionized water for 24 hours in the dark at 2 degrees C after sonication for 15 minutes. The solution was then decanted into sample bottles and analyzed at the Cary Institute for pH, NO3-, SO4-2, NH4+, Cl-, Na+, Ca+2, Mg+2 and K+ for determination of aerosol chemistry. For analytical methods see http://www.caryarchive.org/empdata/metadata/Cary_Institute_Methods_of_Analysis_v2006.pdf. Nitric acid vapor was determined by extracting each nylon filter in 50 ml of a mixture of NaHCO3 (0.28 M) and Na2CO3 (0.22 M) diluted 1:100 with double deionized water. The filters were sonicated for 15 minutes and then refrigerated for 24 hours before decanting the solutions and analyzing them for NO3- and SO4-2. Sulfur dioxide was determined by extracting the carbonate-coated filters in 50 ml of double deionized water with 2 drops of hydrogen peroxide. The filters were sonicated and extracted as described above and the resulting solution was analyzed for SO4-2. Concentrations of SO4-2 from the nylon and carbonate filters were added to determine total SO2. After 1993 all sample extractions were preserved with 2 drops of chloroform. Using the total amount of time that each filter was exposed and the average flow rate for the week, weekly concentrations of each component were calculated. For samples that returned less than detection limit concentrations, one half the detection limit was used to calculate air concentrations. Deposition velocities were estimated using a multi-layer dry deposition model (Meyers, T.P., Finkelstein, P., Clarke, J., Ellestad, T.G., Sims, P.F. 1998. A multilayer model for inferring dry deposition using standard meteorological measurements. Journal of Geophysical Research 103: 22645-22661). Weekly average deposition velocities were combined with weekly concentrations to estimate weekly fluxes. Data sets include monthly mean air concentrations, monthly mean deposition velocities and monthly total deposition. For a descriptions of variables, see variable list with units below.

00577-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The data originates from national monitoring on the effects of the Finnish agri-environment support scheme (MYTVAS). In 1999, 2000 and 2004, data on vascular plants was collected in 36 mesic semi-natural grasslands, representing different management types: 1) continuous seasonal cattle grazing, 2) cattle grazing resumed 3–8 years ago after over 10 years of abandonment, and 3) overgrowing, abandoned over 10 years ago. Each grassland was studied in 1999 or 2000 and the second time in 2004. The study sites were situated in southwestern Finland on mainly southwestern and southeastern slopes by small rivers and brooks on clay soil. All study sites were open grassland without trees and shrubs. The new and most of the old pastures were under the EU agri-environmental scheme of management of traditional rural biotopes. Coverages of vascular plants were estimated on 15 1 m2 plots randomly placed per study area. Additionally, in 1999, all plant species of the whole study area were recorded; in 2000 and 2004, coverages of plant species in the whole study area were estimated using a nine-class scale (1<0.125 %, 2=0.125-0.5 %, 3=0.5-2 %, 4=2-4 %, 5=4-8 %, 6=8-16 %, 7=16-32 %, 8=32-64 %, 9>64 %).

00581-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP): Dead standing litter study data (1985-1989)"
00581-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was a long-term interdisciplinary study on the ecology of prairie wetlands. A scientific team from a variety of disciplines (hydrology, plant ecology, invertebrate ecology, vertebrate ecology, nutrient dynamics, marsh management) was assembled to design and oversee a long-term experiment on the effects of water-level manipulation on northern prairie wetlands. Ten years of fieldwork (1980 -1989), combining a routine long-term monitoring program and a series of short-term studies, generated a wealth of new and diverse information on the ecology and function of prairie wetlands (Murkin, Batt, Caldwell, Kadlec and van der Valk, 2000). This data set includes dead standing litter data (1985-1989), collected as part of the decomposition section of MERP. The high primary productivity in wetlands ensures that plant litter production and decomposition are important factors in wetland nutrient budgets. There are 3 components of the litter pool in prairie wetlands: standing litter, fallen litter, and dissolved organic compounds that leach from both standing and fallen litter (Davis and van der Valk, 1978). Material enters the standing litter compartment with the death of the leaf or shoots. In prairie marshes, litter is transferred from the standing litter compartment to fallen litter primarily through fragmentation by wind, snow, and ice action. In areas of high muskrat activity, feeding and house building can result in living plant tissues directly entering the fallen litter stage. Once within the fallen litter compartment, decomposition rates increase due to the growth of bacteria, fungi, and other consumers on the litter particles. (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). The MERP decomposition studies are a series of short-term studies examining the decomposition rates of both above- and belowground components of the dominant emergent species and the transfer of litter from the standing to the fallen litter compartment within the experimental cells (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Three types of decomposition studies were conducted: litterbag studies, dead standing litter (clip plot) studies and matching stems (permanent clips) studies. The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, ‘clip quadrats’ of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989).

00581-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"MERP Dead standing litter study data (1985-1989) methods Definitions: -All standing litter: on dry sites, all litter that is not lying horizontal on the ground (from the previous August). -Aerial standing litter: dead plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which protrudes above the water surface (from the previous August). -Aerial standing live shoots: live plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which protrudes above the water surface. -Flooded standing live shoots: live plants, in flooded sites, that are not toppled, i.e. a portion of a shoot which is completely submersed or laying on the water surface. The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, ‘clip quadrats’ of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Approximately 150 established research sites (15 sites per each of the 10 MERP cells) were utilized. The criteria for site selection was to represent the natural depth range for each species. New sites were selected when vegetation became sparse or void on previously selected sites. Each site was marked by a numbered stake. Sampling required that 1m x 1m quadrats be clipped at all sites. A randomly selected, undisturbed plot was located within 2 meters of the site marker stake. All clip data was recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. Month of sampling and quadrat moisture condition (dry vs. flooded) determined the incumbent sampling schedule (with the exception of 1985; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). At each dry site, only dead standing shoots within the quadrat were clipped. As with aboveground macrophyte sampling (contained within a separate data package on the KNB), large hand clippers were used, clipping all standing dead shoots rooted within the quadrat. The same general procedure was followed at flooded sites, with the exception that water depth was recorded at the center of each quadrat, and both aerial and flooded portions of a shoot, as well as live and dead (depending on sampling month), were collected and kept separately. For both dry and flooded sites, if a plant was rooted within the quadrat, all foliage was included with the sample even if it extended beyond the quadrat bounds. Within a quadrat, all dominant emergent species (i.e. Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Carex atherodes, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, Scirpus maritimus, Scolochloa festucacea; for 1985, dominant species also included Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium rubrum and Sonchus arvensis), and any additional species with greater than 25% cover, were treated separately. Other species with less than 25% cover were combined and labeled “minor species”. After clipping, these sorted plants were placed into separate paper bags and labeled by 1) species name, 2) collection date, 3) site number, 4) cell, 5) moisture condition along with clip type (i.e. dry standing litter, aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, flooded standing live shoots). Aerial standing litter (dead) was assumed to be from the previous year with the exception of Phragmites, which can persist for one or more years and therefore was separated as fresh litter (shiny; tan color) or old litter (dull; grey color; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). All litter samples were immediately dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius) in the drying room. If necessary, samples were stored in the cold room until space was available in the drying room. Once dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius), each sampled was placed in a paper bag and reweighed to 0.01g accuracy. Both weights were recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. All dried samples were ground in a 40-mesh Wiley mill and each stored in Whirlpak bags. A single sample which occupied more than one storage bag was subsampled at random from all storage bags, taking care to include plant parts in proportion to their relative biomass within the sample (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Clip quadrat samples were analyzed for nutrient (phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen) concentrations by Iowa State University. To reduce costs, only three samples from each species (Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Chenopodium rubrum, Sonchus arvensis, Cirsium arvense, Atriplex patula, Mentha arvensis, Hordeum jubatum, Salix sp., Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus maritimus, Scirpus validus, Carex atherodes) and litter type (aerial and dead samples for spring 1985, fall 1985 and spring 1986, as well as aerial and live, aerial and dead, flooded and live, and flooded and dead for fall 1986) combination were randomly selected for nutrient analysis, and only from the 1985-1986 sampling period.

(1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

The purpose of this study was to estimate annual standing litter production by monitoring standing litter biomass and nutrient concentration. During both early May and August collections, ‘clip quadrats’ of 1m x 1m were used to monitor standing crops of biomass, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon. In May collections, only aerial standing litter (dead) was sampled at dry and flooded sites. In August collections, aerial standing litter (dead, at dry and flooded sites), as well as aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots (at flooded sites) were sampled, keeping the flooded and aerial portions of a stem separate. The experimental time frame was May 1985 to August 1989 (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Approximately 150 established research sites (15 sites per each of the 10 MERP cells) were utilized. The criteria for site selection was to represent the natural depth range for each species. New sites were selected when vegetation became sparse or void on previously selected sites. Each site was marked by a numbered stake. Sampling required that 1m x 1m quadrats be clipped at all sites. A randomly selected, undisturbed plot was located within 2 meters of the site marker stake. All clip data was recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. Month of sampling and quadrat moisture condition (dry vs. flooded) determined the incumbent sampling schedule (with the exception of 1985; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). At each dry site, only dead standing shoots within the quadrat were clipped. As with aboveground macrophyte sampling (contained within a separate data package on the KNB), large hand clippers were used, clipping all standing dead shoots rooted within the quadrat. The same general procedure was followed at flooded sites, with the exception that water depth was recorded at the center of each quadrat, and both aerial and flooded portions of a shoot, as well as live and dead (depending on sampling month), were collected and kept separately. For both dry and flooded sites, if a plant was rooted within the quadrat, all foliage was included with the sample even if it extended beyond the quadrat bounds. Within a quadrat, all dominant emergent species (i.e. Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Carex atherodes, Scirpus validus syn. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Scirpus acutus syn. Schoenoplectus acutus, Scirpus maritimus, Scolochloa festucacea; for 1985, dominant species also included Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Atriplex patula, Chenopodium rubrum and Sonchus arvensis), and any additional species with greater than 25% cover, were treated separately. Other species with less than 25% cover were combined and labeled “minor species”. After clipping, these sorted plants were placed into separate paper bags and labeled by 1) species name, 2) collection date, 3) site number, 4) cell, 5) moisture condition along with clip type (i.e. dry standing litter, aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, flooded standing live shoots). Aerial standing litter (dead) was assumed to be from the previous year with the exception of Phragmites, which can persist for one or more years and therefore was separated as fresh litter (shiny; tan color) or old litter (dull; grey color; Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). All litter samples were immediately dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius) in the drying room. If necessary, samples were stored in the cold room until space was available in the drying room. Once dried to constant weight (80 degrees Celcius), each sampled was placed in a paper bag and reweighed to 0.01g accuracy. Both weights were recorded on the standing litter clip plot field sheets. All dried samples were ground in a 40-mesh Wiley mill and each stored in Whirlpak bags. A single sample which occupied more than one storage bag was subsampled at random from all storage bags, taking care to include plant parts in proportion to their relative biomass within the sample (Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989). Clip quadrat samples were analyzed for nutrient (phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen) concentrations by Iowa State University. To reduce costs, only three samples from each species (Aster brachyactis syn. Symphytotrichum ciliatum, Chenopodium rubrum, Sonchus arvensis, Cirsium arvense, Atriplex patula, Mentha arvensis, Hordeum jubatum, Salix sp., Typha glauca syn. Typha × glauca, Phragmites australis, Scolochloa festucacea, Scirpus maritimus, Scirpus validus, Carex atherodes) and litter type (aerial and dead samples for spring 1985, fall 1985 and spring 1986, as well as aerial and live, aerial and dead, flooded and live, and flooded and dead for fall 1986) combination were randomly selected for nutrient analysis, and only from the 1985-1986 sampling period.

Murkin, pp. 31-34. Manitoba, Canada: Delta Waterfowl Research Station. Marsh Ecology Research Program: Objectives, study area and experimental design (1980-1989) Introduction Good et al. (1978) and Greeson et al. (1978) were among the first to summarize the state of our understanding in freshwater wetland ecology. They emphasized the need for expanded interdisciplinary research in freshwater wetlands. Ten years later, van der Valk (1989), in Northern Prairie Wetlands, focused specifically on prairie wetlands and the influence of water-level changes on the dynamics and productivity of these systems. Primary production, secondary production, vegetation composition and distribution, animal use, and nutrient budgets are all affected as water levels rise and fall with variation in precipitation. Ranging from tiny potholes to huge lacustrine complexes, prairie wetlands are among the world's most productive ecosystems (Murkin, 1989a). Their importance as wildlife production areas has drawn considerable attention to their conservation and management (Weller, 1978; Weller, 1981). This attention has increased in recent years with the need for information on the overall functions and values of wetlands within the prairie landscape (Murkin, 1998). Understanding wetland values is critical to the development of comprehensive wetland conservation programs. In addition, the ongoing destruction of wetlands through drainage, urban sprawl, and other human-induced changes has added a great deal of urgency to the need for a better understanding of the ecology and management of all remaining wetland areas (Murkin et al., 2000a). Objectives Recognizing the need for an improved understanding of prairie wetland ecology, the Marsh Ecology Research Program (MERP) was initiated in 1979 as a joint project of Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station (Murkin et al., 1984). The MERP was designed as a long-term replicated experiment addressing the impacts of various water levels on the main components of the prairie wetland ecosystem. The overall objective of MERP was to document the changes that occur within a prairie wetland during a simulated wet-dry cycle (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). More specifically, MERP was designed to determine the storage (pools) and movement (fluxes) of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and carbon (C) during the various stages of the cycle (Murkin et al., 2000a). Specific objectives for each of the major ecosystem components were as follows: 1. Hydrology: to estimate the terms of the water budget during all stages of the wet-dry cycle: surface water in and out, ground water in and out, change in storage, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. 2. Water chemistry: to estimate the concentrations of N, P, C, and major ions in both surface and substrate pore-water pools and to monitor changes in these pools during the wet-dry cycle. 3. Macrophytes: to estimate annual above- and below ground macrophyte productivity and standing crops and subsequent changes related to the wet-dry cycle. Storage and movement of N, P, and C in macrophytes during the wet-dry cycle also were determined. 4. Macrophyte litter: to estimate the annual production of above- and belowground macrophyte litter and the loss and uptake of N, P, and C to and from the litter compartment. 5. Algae: to estimate algal standing crops and productivity (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon, and metaphyton) during the various stages of the wet-dry cycle. 6. Invertebrates: to estimate standing crops of invertebrates (nekton, benthos, and emerging insects) during the various phases of the wet-dry cycle. 7. Vertebrates: to monitor use by waterfowl, coots, blackbirds, and muskrats in response to habitat changes during the wet- dry cycle. The MERP experimental design and field-sampling protocols were developed to meet these objectives. Nutrient data were used to construct nutrient budgets for the experimental cells. Several additional objectives beyond those related specifically to nutrient storage and movement also were addressed. Examples are rate of recovery of plant communities following drawdown (Welling et al., 1988a), habitat use by various vertebrate groups during specific stages of the wet-dry cycle (Clark and Kroeker, 1993), and the effect of the wet-dry cycle on individual invertebrate species (Ross and Murkin, 1993; Murkin et al., 2000a). Study Area The MERP study area was located on the Delta Marsh in south-central Manitoba, Canada (5011'N, 98°19'W). The Delta Marsh is a large lacustrine marsh (15,000 ha) along the southern shore of Lake Manitoba (see Batt, 2000). The marsh is of Pleistocene origin and is a remnant of glacial Lake Agassiz (Löve and Löve, 1954, Ehrlich et al., 1957). An important feature of the marsh is that its water level has been stabilized for many years (due to installation of a water-control structure on Lake Manitoba in 1961), resulting in lake marsh conditions described by van der Valk and Davis (1978) over much of its area (Murkin et al., 2000a). The site for the MERP experimental complex was chosen because of several features. First, the area had representative portions of shallow- and deep-marsh zones characteristic of the Delta Marsh and other northern prairie marshes. Second, the area was remote and completely within the private ownership of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station, thus ensuring access for researchers, while affording effective control of trespass and disturbance. Third, the site was served by an existing road system. This road system was crucial, given the large number of individuals working on the site each day; the large numbers and volumes of water, soil, vegetation, and animal samples to be handled; and the logistics of transporting and maintaining sampling devices. Finally, the existing road provided the northern boundary of the experimental cells, thereby reducing construction costs. The water levels used in the experiments were chosen to reflect conditions that had occurred naturally during the previous 5 decades. Thus, the experimental site and design has provided information that is relevant to any future management efforts on the Delta Marsh, specifically, and wetland management in general. The experimental cell complex consisted of 10 contiguous 4-6 ha marsh units (Cells 1-10), created in 1979 by building a series of dikes along the northern edge of the main marsh. The diked experimental cells were numbered 1 to 10 from west to east. The approximate dimension of each diked cell was 150m x 300m (see Table 1 for the specific dimensions of each cell). Disturbance due to dike construction was confined to the dikes and a 10m buffer strip on each side of the dike. Each diked cell was equipped with a water control structure and electric pump with automatic controls to adjust and maintain (2cm) water levels according to the schedule (see Table 2). Besides the diked cells, two undiked areas of similar size within the Delta Marsh (Cells 11 & 12) were monitored as reference cells (i.e. reference cells to the unmanipulated Delta Marsh). The vegetation within the diked cells prior to the experimental treatments was comparable to the reference cells and main Delta Marsh (Pederson 1981; Murkin et al., 2000a). Experimental Design The general MERP objective was to monitor the response of various aspects of the wetland ecosystem to a series of water-level manipulations intended to simulate the wet-dry cycle of prairie wetlands. The schedule for water-level treatments and the number of replicates for each treatment are shown in Tables 2 and 3. The study was basically divided into four phases. The first two phases (baseline and deep flooding) were designed to provide background information on the experimental cells and to bring all cells to a similar condition (lake marsh stage) before the actual wet-dry cycle was applied during the last two phases (drawdown and reflooding; Murkin et al., 2000a). The four phases of the experimental design were as follows: a. Baseline year (1980-1981): During the first year of the study (1980), the control structures were left open and water levels within the cells were allowed to track the levels of the Delta Marsh. This method provided a year of baseline data before the actual water-level manipulations began. Two of the cells (3 and 7) were kept at baseline levels for a second year (1981) to allow for comparison of different durations of drawdown later in the study (see Table 3). b. Deep flooding (aka Conditioning Period; 1981-1983): Following the baseline year(s), all diked cells were flooded to ~ 1 m above normal for a period of 2 years (Table 2). These levels were designed to flood the existing cattail (Typha spp.) stands to a depth of 1 m and were similar to actual natural high-water levels that occurred in the Delta Marsh in the 1950s. This deep flooding was intended to kill the existing emergent vegetation and set all the cells to the lake marsh stage described by van der Valk and Davis (1978). In part, deep flooding was also an attempt to reduce the variability in vegetation among the experimental cells prior to drawdown. c. Drawdown (1983-1984): After the second year of above-normal flooding, the cells were drawn down (completely dewatered) by adjusting the water levels to 50 cm below the long-term level of the Delta Marsh (Table 2). Most cells were exposed to a 2-year drawdown. Two cells (3 and 7) were drawn down for 1 year to allow comparisons between drawdowns of 1- and 2-year durations. The drawdowns allowed vegetation to reestablish on the marsh substrates (Welling et al., 1988a, b). d. Reflooding (1985-1989): It has been assumed that the rate at which prairie wetlands proceed through the various stages of the wet-dry cycle is determined by water depth, with deeper wetlands moving to the lake marsh stage more quickly than shallowly flooded wetlands (van der Valk and Davis, 1978). Following drawdown, the cells were reflooded to three different levels (Table 3). The normal level was the long-term mean level (247.50 m above mean sea level [AMSL]) of the Delta Marsh and the medium (247.80 m) and high (248.10 m) levels were 30 and 60 cm above the long-term mean, respectively (Murkin et al., 2000a). To ensure replicated treatments (on a hydrologic basis) during the reflooding experiments in 1985-1989, water-level treatments were assigned to the experimental cells as follows: the two low-water treatments with a 1-year drawdown (Table 3) were randomly assigned to the experimental complex, and the remaining treatments were then assigned to the other cells to ensure that each cell within a water-level treatment had a similar hydrologic setting (i.e. both low cells with 1-year drawdowns were flanked by cells with low and high treatments, both low 2-year drawdown cells by low and medium treatments, all medium treatment cells by high- and low-treatment cells, and the high-treatment cells by medium and low cells). This replicated hydrology is discussed in more detail in Kadlec (1983, 1993). The treatment assignments for the 1985-1989 period (Table 3) determined the water-level assignments during the early phases of the MERP experiments from 1981 to 1984 (Table 2). Long-term Monitoring Program The Scientific Team designed a program of standardized methods to monitor the experimental cells throughout the period of study. The basic strategy was to collect a comparable data set from year to year in each experimental cell for each of the major components being monitored, including hydrology, water chemistry, macrophytes, macrophyte litter, algae, invertebrates and vertebrates (Murkin et al., 2000a; Murkin, 1989b). The MERP long-term monitoring program involved a variety of techniques that were used to provide comparable datasets across the experimental cells and over the 10 years of fieldwork. Some of the techniques used were new, but most were adopted from other researchers. All have been modified to suit the needs for efficiency, economy and practicality for long-term large-scale ecosystem research (Murkin et al., 2000b). Each component has a section in the MERP Data Archive describing the techniques used. Short-term Studies Besides the long-term monitoring program, short-term studies were an integral component of the overall MERP program. Some of these studies provided background information needed to develop the long-term monitoring program (Pederson, 1981; Wrubleski, 1984). Some were integrated into the long-term monitoring program (Murkin, 1983a; Galinato, 1985; Hosseini, 1986; Welling, 1987; Merendino, 1989). Several aspects of the long-term monitoring program following drawdown began as short-term studies (Kroeker, 1988; Squires, 1991; Wrubleksi, 1991). Many of the short-term studies, however, were initiated because of questions raised by the long-term monitoring program. This approach was particularly true for studies of invertebrates (Nelson, 1982; Neckles, 1984; Bicknese, 1987; Campeau, 1990) and emergent macrophytes (Neill, 1988; Neill, 1992). Many of the short-term studies were conducted by graduate studies, a list of which can be found in merp_pubs_appx3_prairie_wetland_ecology_pdfa.pdf and whose theses can be found in the merp_publications_theses file (Murkin et al., 2000a). Main Transects, Work Lanes and Sampling Procedure To aid in the assignment of sampling stations, each cell was divided into 10 zones. Zone boundaries were parallel to the southern dike. To determine the zones, 10 areas of equal width were established between a line 10 m north of the south dike and a second line 10 m south of the road on the northern edge of the cell. These zones were permanently marked so they could be located from year to year. Each year, ten transects were randomly established within each cell, 1 per zone, numbered from north to south. These transects or ‘work lanes’ were used for all types of routine sampling, in order to minimize disturbance and confine it within a designated region. All sampling took place as near as possible to the work lane. When a sampling point was some distance from the work lane, a path perpendicular to the work lane was established. Work lanes were reassigned each fall following the last day of sampling (Murkin, 1989b; Murkin et al., 2000b). A standard sampling procedure was maintained during all transect sampling. One or two random transects in each cell were sampled, repeating the same method for each cell until all samples were secured, rather than sampling all transects in a cell before moving on to the next cell. This randomized any effect due to time during the sampling period. As standard procedure, water depth at the sampling site was recorded during all types of sampling (Murkin, 1983b).

As the dead standing litter (1985-1989) data was never published, no reason can be given as to this change in methodology; however, the reduction in number of sites may have been to reduce the impact of sampling on the cells, or to reduce the workload. site number (1-220) h2o_depth water depth (cm) water depth was recorded at the centre of each quadrat. In addition to sampling month, water depth (i.e. dry vs. flooded) also determined the type of litter sampled (i.e. if dry = aerial standing litter, if flooded = aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots, aerial standing flooded shoots) Note: Water depth data for Fall 1985 was only recorded on the fieldsheets as 'flooded', 'dry' or 'trace', and was therefore not included in the data file. centimeter real aerial_flood aerial or flooded 1=aerial (i.e. plants that are not toppled and, if at flooded sites, above the water surface) 2=flooded (i.e. plants that are not toppled and, if at flooded sites, completely submersed or laying on top of the water surface) whether aerial or flooded shoots were sampled was determined according to the sampling month. If sampled in May, only aerial standing litter (1) was collected from dry and flooded sites. If sampled in August, aerial and flooded shoots were collected at flooded sites, as well as aerial standing litter from dry sites. The exception to this is 1985, where aerial and flooded litter was sampled in May, but only aerial litter sampled in August. 1 aerial (i.e. plants that are not toppled and, if at flooded sites, above the water surface) 2 flooded (i.e. plants that are not toppled and, if at flooded sites, completely submersed or laying on top of the water surface) live_dead live or dead 1=live 2=dead Starting in 1986, whether live or dead shoots were sampled was determined according to the sampling month. If sampled in May, only aerial standing litter (i.e. dead) was collected from dry and flooded sites. If sampled in August, live and dead shoots (i.e. aerial standing litter, aerial standing live shoots and flooded standing live shoots) were collected from flooded sites, in addition to the collection of standing litter from dry sites (note that although the Murkin, van der Valk and Nelson, 1989 MERP procedures manual methods state that in August, only dead standing litter was collected at dry sites, the dataset also contains aerial standing live shoots at dry sites. It is unknown why this data is included, and whether or not there was a change in study design which was not recorded in the MERP procedures).

00586-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: HADCM3 A1F Model: 2050 Minimum Temperature"
00586-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFrom the IPCC website: The A1 Family storyline is a case of rapid and successful economic development, in which regional averages of income per capita converge - current distinctions between poor and rich countries eventually dissolve. In this scenario family, demographic and economic trends are closely linked, as affluence is correlated with long life and small families (low mortality and low fertility). Global population grows to some nine billion by 2050 and declines to about seven billion by 2100. Average age increases, with the needs of retired people met mainly through their accumulated savings in private pension systems. The global economy expands at an average annual rate of about three percent to 2100. This is approximately the same as average global growth since 1850, although the conditions that lead to a global economic in productivity and per capita incomes are unparalleled in history. Income per capita reaches about US$21,000 by 2050. While the high average level of income per capita contributes to a great improvement in the overall health and social conditions of the majority of people, this world is not without its problems. In particular, many communities could face some of the problems of social exclusion encountered by the wealthiest countries in the 20th century and in many places income growth could come with increased pressure on the global commons. Energy and mineral resources are abundant in this scenario family because of rapid technical progress, which both reduce the resources need to produce a given level of output and increases the economically recoverable reserves. Final energy intensity (energy use per unit of GDP) decreases at an average annual rate of 1.3 percent. With the rapid increase in income, dietary patterns shift initially significantly towards increased consumption of meat and dairy products, but may decrease subsequently with increasing emphasis on health of an aging society. High incomes also translate into high car ownership, sprawling suburbanization and dense transport networks, nationally and internationally. Land prices increase faster than income per capita. These factors along with high wages result in a considerable intensification of agriculture. Three scenario groups are considered in A1 scenario family reflecting the uncertainty in development of energy sources and conversion technologies in this rapidly changing world. Near-term investment decisions may introduce long-term irreversibilities into the market, with lock-in to one technological configuration or another. The A1B scenario group is based on a balanced mix of energy sources and has an intermediate level of CO2 emissions, but depending on the energy sources developed, emissions in the variants cover a very wide range. In the fossil-fuel intensive scenario group A1FI, emissions approach those of the A2 scenarios; conversely in scenario group A1T with low labor productivity or of rapid progress in 'post-fossil' energy technologies, emissions are intermediate between those of B1 and B2. These scenario variants have been introduced into the A1 storyline because of its 'high growth with high tech' nature, where differences in alternative technology developments translate into large differences in future GHG emission levels Ecological resilience is assumed to be high in this storyline. Environmental amenities are viewed in a utilitarian way, based on their influence on the formal economy. The concept of environmental quality might change in thisstoryline from'conservation' of nature to active 'management' - and marketing - of natural and environmental services. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

Measure leaf scenescence The percent of each leaf that had turned brown was estimated visually Study plots were located in the restored experimental grassland near the main reserve office. Outplants were placed in plots established as part of an experiment established with the primary goal was to determine the mutual invasibility of native and exotic grasslands. Each experiment included plots that had an experimentally determined initial composition (exotic annual or native perennial) and included a single addition of perennial seed to annual communities and of annual seed to the perennial communities in the fall of 2000. Seeding rates were 1000 live seeds m-2 (average seed production of perennial grasses in our experiment). To establish exotic-annual communities, we killed perennial grasses with a short-lived herbicide (Roundup) one year prior to the seed-addition treatments. To ensure the establishment of a dense stand of exotics, we added all seeds collected from a nearby stand of exotic annuals of equal area to each annual plot. The most common species in the annual plots were Bromus hordeaceus, B. diandris, and Brassica nigra. The initial composition and seeding treatments were overlain with 4 g N m-2 yr-1 added as NH4NO3 (5 replicates for a total of 40 plots, 3 x 3 m)."

00591-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Quantitative comparisons of distribution and abundance of exotic species in their native and non-native ranges represent a first step when studying invaders. However, this approach is rarely applied &#1113142; particularly to tree species. Using biogeo- graphical contrasts coupled with regional dispersal surveys, we assessed whether two exotic maple tree species, Acer negundo and Acer platanoides, can be classified as invasive in the non-native regions surveyed. We also examined the importance of biogeography in determining the degree of invasion by exotic species using this reciprocal approach. Local-scale surveys were conducted in a total of 34 forests to compare density, relative abundance, age structure of native and introduced populations, and whether the two introduced maple species negatively affected native tree species density. Regional-scale surveys of a total of 136 forests were then conducted to assess distribution in the introduced regions. Introduced popula- tions of A. negundo were denser than populations measured in their native range and negatively related to native tree species density. Age structure did not differ between regions for this species. At the regional scale, this species has invaded most of the riparian corridors sampled in France. Conversely, the density of A. platanoides introduced populations was similar to that of native populations and was not related to native tree species density. Although seedling recruitment was higher away than at home, this species has invaded only 9% of the forests sampled in southern Ontario, Canada. Although reported invasive, these two exotic maple species differed in their relative demographic parameters and regional spread. Acer negundo is currently invasive in southern France while A. platanoides is not aggressively invasive in southern Ontario. Importantly, this study effectively demonstrates that biogeography through structured contrasts provide a direct means to infer invasion of exotic species."

Two seasons were extensively in both regions. Every accessible forest was surveyed to estimate extent of invasion. Spatially-structured density surveys were conducted in both native and non-native ranges for each maple tree species. In total, 20 forests were surveyed in southern Ontario, Canada and 14 in southern France (Supplementary material Appendix 1, Table A1, A2). Within each forest, population densities were estimated not only for the introduced maple tree species but also for the native tree species occurring in the non-native range recipient communities. Acer negundo populations were sampled in 16 forests in Canada and 7 in France and Acer platanoides populations in 10 forests in Canada and 7 in France. All the population densities were estimated with the same T-square method, a plotless density estimator based on tree-to-nearest-tree measurements (Byth 1982). Specifically, introduced and native tree stem densities were assessed using 600 m transects with regular sampling at 3 m intervals. Both the distance from the transect to the nearest target tree species and the distance from that individual to its closest neighbour were recorded at each interval (Krebs 1999, Steinke and Hennenberg 2006). This distance-based sampling technique provides an accurate estimate of both density and degree of spatial aggregation (Steinke and Hennenberg 2006). Moreover, the life-stage of each stem sampled was also recorded as seedlings (&#1113143; 0.5 m in height), juveniles (&#1113144;0.5 m but &#1113143;3 m) or reproductively mature adults (&#1113144; 3 m)."

00592-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: CSIRO B2a Model: 2020 Radiation"
00592-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The CSIRO Atmospheric Research Mark 2b climate model (Hirst et al., 1996, 1999) has recently been used for a number of more sophisticated climate change simulations. These start from 1880 to avoid the 'cold start problem'. This version of the CSIRO model includes the Gent-McWilliams mixing scheme in the ocean and shows greatly reduced climate drift relative to earlier versions (e.g. Dix and Hunt, 1998). The drift in global mean surface temperature in the new control run is about -0.02 degrees C/century. Note that the model uses flux correction. The model atmosphere has 9 levels in the vertical and horizontal resolution of spectral R21 (approximately 5.6 by 3.2 degrees). The ocean model has the same horizontal resolution with 21 levels. The equilibrium sensitivity to doubled CO2 of a mixed layer ocean version of the model is 4.3 degrees. This is at the high end of the range of model sensitivities (e.g. IPCC 1995, Table 6.3). In the basic greenhouse gas experiment the model combines the effect of all radiatively active trace gases into an 'equivalent' CO2 concentration. Observed concentrations are used from 1880 to 1990 and the IS92a projections into the future. This gives close to a 1%/year compounding increase of equivalent CO2. Another model experiment includes the negative radiative forcing from atmospheric sulphate aerosol. The direct aerosol forcing is included via a perturbation of the surface albedo, similarly to the Hadley Centre experiments described by Mitchell et al (1995) and Mitchell and Johns (1997) . The sulphate concentrations are the same as used in the Hadley Centre experiments. However the chosen aerosol optical properties are different, giving a present day forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate of about -0.4 W/m^2. This can be compared to the 1880-1990 greenhouse gas forcing of about 2 W/m^2. The magnitude of the 20th century warming in the model including aerosol matches the observed reasonably well. However there are a number of forcings missing from the model, including solar variability, sulphate indirect effect and the effect of soot. The climate sensitivity of CSIRO-Mk2 is about 4.3 degrees C (Watterson et al.,1997). Like B1, the B2 world is one of increased concern for environmental and social sustainability, but the character of this world differs substantially. Education and welfare programs are widely pursued leading to reductions in mortality and, to a lesser extent, fertility. The population reaches about 10 billion people by 2100, consistent with both the United Nations and IIASA median projections. Income per capita grows at an intermediary rate to reach about US$12,000 by 2050. By 2100 the global economy might expand to reach some US$250 trillion. International income differences decrease, although not as rapidly as in scenarios of higher global convergence (A1, B1). Local inequity is reduced considerably through the development of stronger community support networks. Generally high educational levels promote both development and environmental protection. Indeed, environmental protection is one of the few remaining truly international priorities. However, strategies to address global environmental challenges are less successful than in B1, as governments have difficulty designing and implementing agreements that combine environmental protection with mutual economic benefits. The B2 storyline presents a particularly favorable climate for community initiative and social innovation, especially in view of high educational levels. Technological frontiers are pushed less than in A1 and B1 and innovations are also regionally more heterogeneous. Globally, investment in R and D continues its current declining trend, and mechanisms for international diffusion of technology and know-how remain weaker than in scenarios A1 and B1 (but higher than in scenario A2). Some regions with rapid economic development and limited natural resources place particular emphasis on technology development and bilateral co-operation. Technical change is therefore uneven. The energy intensity of GDP declines at about one percent per year, in line with the average historical experience of the last two centuries. Land-use management becomes better integrated at the local level in the B2 world. Urban and transport infrastructure is a particular focus of community innovation, contributing to a low level of car dependence and less urban sprawl. An emphasis on food self-reliance contributes to a shift in dietary patterns towards local products, with reduced meat consumption in countries with high population densities. Energy systems differ from region to region, depending on the availability of natural resources. The need to use energy and other resources more efficiently spurs the development of less carbon-intensive technology in some regions. Environment policy cooperation at the regional level leads to success in the management of some transboundary environmental problems, such as acidification due to SO2, especially to sustain regional self-reliance in agricultural production. Regional cooperation also results in lower emissions of NOx and VOCs, reducing the incidence of elevated tropospheric ozone levels. Although globally the energy system remains predominantly hydrocarbon-based to 2100, there is a gradual transition away from the current share of fossil resources in world energy supply, with a corresponding reduction in carbon intensity."

00594-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The 15-hectare Doi Inthanon Forest Dynamics Plot, located in the shadow of the highest peak in Thailand - Doi Inthanon - was founded in 1997 by Osaka City and Utsunomiya Universities (Japan), Kasetsart University (Thailand), and the Royal Thai Forest Department. The Doi Inthanon forest is in a typical monsoon climate, and, thus, the lower elevations contain deciduous forest while the areas above 1,500 meters (areas often covered in clouds) contain evergreen forests. Situated at 1,700 meters, the Doi Inthanon FDP typifies the montane evergreen forest, and acts as the Asian equivalent to the montane La Planada site in Colombia. There are approximately 120 tree species and 17,000 trees in the first three hectares analyzed from the Doi Inthanon FDP."

00596-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Data were collected in eight wildfire burn areas one year post-fire and eight adjacent non-burned areas. All data were collected throughout the summers of 2007 and 2008. For each tree sampled, data were recorded on mountain pine beetle colonization, fire injury category of the tree, percent basal injury, percent bole injury, percent canopy injury, cambium kill rating, mistletoe rating, blister rust lesion presence, percent slope of transect, degree aspect of transect, elevation of transect, burn or non-burn site name, size of burn, mountain pine beetle population size, year of burn, and transect name. The purpose of the data was to measure the colonization of mountain pine beetle in lodgepole pines experiencing varying degrees of fire injury."

00599-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: HADCM3 A2b Model: 2080 Precipitation"
00599-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFor the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

00602-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Habitat for birds and other animals is disappearing quickly from the Earth's surface. Conservationists are in a race against time to protect remaining habitat to stem the loss of biodiversity. Critical to these conservation efforts is focusing on-the-ground actions on the places where threatened species are found. To aid conservationists in determining where these species occur, NatureServe formed part of a consortium of conservation organizations that joined forces to develop a digital library of the distributions of the birds and mammals of the Western Hemisphere. The goal of the project was to make these maps easily accessible to conservation planners and other interested users. The data presented here represents an updated version of major product of this collaboration—a digital map library of the distributions of the birds of the Western Hemisphere, now covering 4,273 species. The maps are annotated to indicate sources, migratory status, historic versus current ranges, origin (native or introduced) and taxonomic decisions. The migratory status indications are particularly detailed, distinguishing where birds are permanent residents, breeding residents, non-breeding residents, or passage migrants. These maps are presented as a free resource for conservationists, researchers, and the general public. To view the map for each species, visit our InfoNatura website, search for the species you are interested in, and click on 'Range Map.' To download the map files in ArcView format, see below. The map files can be viewed using ESRI ArcExplorer software, which can be downloaded for free from ESRI's website. Please contact ESRI, not NatureServe, for any support needs related to the software."

00603-metadata.xml,Resource Title,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"IPCC Climate Change Data: HADCM3 A2b Model: 2020 Maximum Temperature"
00603-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The recent experiments performed at the Hadley Centre have used the new Unified Model (Cullen, 1993). These experiments represent a large step forward in the way climate change is modelled by GCMs and raises new possibilities for scenario construction. This experiment has overcome some of the major difficulties that were associated with the previous generations of equilibrium (circa IPCC 1990) and cold-start transient (circa IPCC 1992) climate change experiments. HadCM2 has a spatial resolution of 2.5 degrees x 3.75 degrees (latitude by longitude) and the representation produces a grid box resolution of 96 x 73 grid cells. This produces a surface spatial resolution of about 417km x 278 km reducing to 295 x 278km at 45 degrees North and South (comparable to a spectral resolution of T42). The equilibrium climate sensitivity (DT2x) of HadCM2, that is the global-mean temperature response to a doubling of effective CO2 concentration, is approximately 2.5 degrees C, although, this quantity varies with the time-scale considered. This is somewhat lower than most other GCMs (IPCC, 1992). In order to undertake a 'warm-start' experiment it is necessary to perturb the model with a forcing from an early historical era, when the radiative forcing was relatively small compared to the present. The Hadley Centre started their experiments performed with HadCM2 with forcing from the middle industrial era, about 1860 Mitchell et al., 1995 and Johns et al., 1995. The greenhouse gas only integrations, HadCM2GG, used the combined forcing of all the greenhouse gases as an equivalent CO2 concentration. A further series of integrations, HadCM2GS, used the combined equivalent CO2 concentration plus the negative forcing from sulphate aerosols. The HadCM2GG integrations simulated the change in forcing of the climate system by greenhouse gases since the early industrial period (taken by HadCM2 to be 1860). The addition of the negative forcing effects of sulphate aerosols represents the direct radiative forcing due to anthropogenic sulphate aerosols by means of an increase in clear-sky surface albedo proportional to the local sulphate loading (refer to Mitchell et al., 1995 for details of this method). The indirect effects of aerosols were not simulated. The modelled control climate shows a negligible long term trend in surface air temperature over the first 400 years. The trend is about +0.04 degrees C per century, which is comparable to other such experiments. HadCM2CON represents an improvement over previous generations of GCMs that have been used at the Hadley Centre (Johns et al., 1995 and Airey et al., 1995). The experiments performed have simulated the observed climate system using estimated forcing perturbations since 1860. Johns et al., (1995) and Mitchell et al., (1995) have established that HadCM2's sensitivity is consistent with the real climate system. The agreement between the observed global-mean temperature record and that produced in these experiments is better for HadCM2GS than for HadCM2GG. This implies that HadCM2Gs has captured the observed signal of global-mean temperature changes better than HadCM2GG for the recent 100-year record. The climate sensitivity of HadCM2 is about 2.5 degrees CFor the A2 emissions scenario the main emphasis is on a strengthening of regional and local culture, with a return to family values in many regions. The A2 world consolidates into a series of roughly continental economic regions, emphasizing local cultural roots. In some regions, increased religious participation leads many to reject a materialist path and to focus attention on contributing to the local community. Elsewhere, the trend is towards increased investment in education and science and growth in economic productivity. Social and political structures diversify, with some regions moving towards stronger welfare systems and reduced income inequality, while others move towards 'lean' government. Environmental concerns are relatively weak, although some attention is paid to bringing local pollution under control and maintaining local environmental amenities. The A2 world sees more international tensions and less cooperation than in A1 or B1. People, ideas and capital are less mobile so that technology diffuses slowly. International disparities in productivity, and hence income per capita, are maintained or increased. With the emphasis on family and community life, fertility rates decline only slowly, although they vary among regions. Hence, this scenario family has high population growth (to 15 billion by 2100) with comparatively low incomes per capita relative to the A1 and B1 worlds, at US$7,200 in 2050 and US$16,000 in 2100.Technological change is rapid in some regions and slow in others as industry adjusts to local resource endowments, culture, and education levels. Regions with abundant energy and mineral resources evolve more resource intensive economies, while those poor in resources place very high priority on minimizing import dependence through technological innovation to improve resource efficiency and make use of substitute inputs. The fuel mix in different regions is determined primarily by resource availability. And divisions among regions persist in terms of their mix of technologies, with high-income but resource-poor regions shifting toward advanced post fossil technologies (renewables in regions of large land availability, nuclear in densely populated, resource poor regions) and low-income resource-rich regions generally relying on older fossil technologies.With substantial food requirements, agricultural productivity is one of the main focus areas for innovation and RD efforts in this future. Initially high levels of soil erosion and water pollution are eventually eased through the local development of more sustainable high-yield agriculture.Although attention is given to potential local and regional environmental damage, it is not uniform across regions. For example, sulfur and particulate emissions are reduced in Asia due to impacts on human health and agricultural production but increase in Africa as a result of the intensified exploitation of coal and other mineral resources. The A2 world sees high energy and carbon intensity, and correspondingly high GHG emissions. Its CO2 emissions are the highest of all four scenario families. Data are available for the following periods: 1961-1990, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; and 2090-2099 Mean monthly and change fields."

I will use Lupinus bicolor as my study species, because it is a popular restoration species in California, and its selfing nature will decrease the possibility of genetic contamination from nearby populations. To determine fecundity I will count all seeds produced by each plant. To calculate the genetic variance of the offspring generation I will measure physiological traits, and analyze them using a parent-offspring regression. To test my hypothesis, I will compare the difference in genetic variation between the control and each that population at each restoration site. If there is a greater increase in genetic variance between the control and the populations at the faraway restoration sites than between the control and the adjacent restoration site, my hypothesis that there is a greater breakdown of canalization in populations moved to foreign restoration sites in comparison with populations move to local restoration sites will be supported."

00605-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Opportunistic and Targeted Herpetofaunal Surveys Reptiles and amphibians included in this dataset were collected by hand, seine, dip-net, lizard noose, submersible turtle trap, and by flip-and-replacement of natural and artificial cover objects. Sampling effort was focused on documenting taxa from as many localities on the reserves as possible. As such, for common species, localities with large numbers of conspecific study subjects were only lightly sampled, in favor of broader sampling of conspecifics at multiple locations. Pond- or stream-breeding amphibians were the exceptions: for these taxa large sample sizes were collected at every discrete breeding site we surveyed. Animals were obtained by searching any habitat deemed suitable for a species known or suspected to occur on the reserves. Surveys for terrestrial taxa generally involved walking through suitable habitat types, and searching for surface-active animals or animals present under cover objects. Surveys for aquatic taxa involved trapping (for turtles), or seining/dip-netting ponds. All species of herpetofauna known or suspected to occur at each reserve were targeted for inclusion in this dataset, with few exceptions. Surveys and sampling were conducted across all habitat types at each reserve. Taxa were targeted only when seasonal conditions were most conducive to maximal sampling efficiency. For example, plethodontid salamanders were targeted immediately after rainstorms, and whiptail lizards were targeted in the summer. Sampling at the reserves was fairly regular (roughly one survey per week, on average) at Stebbins Cold Canyon and Quail Ridge between late March and late July, 2012. Sampling was much less frequent at Jepson Prairie, since it hosts a comparatively depauperate herpetofaunal assemblage relative to the other two reserves. In the future, sampling at these three reserves will be more infrequent and opportunistic, with surveys initiated only to fill gaps in the existing dataset presented here. The goal of this projects sampling was to rapidly obtain tissue from 20 individuals, and sacrifice up to three voucher specimens, per species per reserve. For pond- or stream-breeding amphibians, these sampling numbers were increased to a per-breeding-site basis, rather than a per-reserve basis. The sampling protocols implemented to achieve this goal were not standardized or replicable. Estimating relative abundance or population sizes of herp taxa, or comparing the data to future surveys as part of a monitoring scheme, are not appropriate applications for this dataset. Instead, the dataset could be consulted as pilot information by researchers interested in answering those questions, to allow them to choose productive study sites."

00608-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This investigation proceeded along two lines. First, individuals gathered data on 208 HCPs that had been approved by August 1997 in order to obtain basic descriptive information about plans. Second, the group conducted a more comprehensive analysis for a focal subset (43) of these plans. The HCPs in the focal subset range widely in geographic location, size, duration, methods, and approval dates. For this in-depth investigation, we developed two separate data questionnaires: one asked for information on theplans themselves, and the other focused on listed species and their treatment within HCPs. These questionnaires included information about what scientific data were available for use in formulating the HCP, how existing data were used, and the rigor of analysis used in each stage of the HCP process. As a whole, the questions were designed to generate a detailed profile of each HCP and to document the use (or lack thereof) of scientific data and tools. Plans were not judged overall; rather, questionnaires focused on different stages of the planning process, including the HCPs assessment of (1) the status of the species; (2) the take of species under the HCP; (3) the impact of the take on the species; (4) the mitigation for the anticipated take; and (5) the biological monitoring associated with the HCP. All of the data sheets, plan descriptions, and other detailed results from this effort are available on the NCEAS website: http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/projects/2049 . All descriptions of the data set contents are provided through the HCP report available at the web site above. In general the data sets contain responses to the questionaires from the HCP surveys. Each question is listed by question number in the data set and is described in detail in the HCP report (see web site). In addition, a listing of thecontents of the four final data sets is provided in the file hcp-load.lst."
