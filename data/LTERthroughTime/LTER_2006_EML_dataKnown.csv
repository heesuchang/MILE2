Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

Although the majority of the streams in the study are found in Taylor Valley, data has also been collected from streams in the nearby Miers, Alph, Wright, Pearse, Garwood, and Victoria Valleys. An extensive network of gauging stations was set up throughout these valleys to monitor the stream hydrology. While collecting hydrology data, stream water samples to be used for nutrient analysis are also gathered. Sample locations for stream nutrient data thus coincides with those for hydrology samples. Locations also remain consistent from season to season. Specific latitudes and longitudes for each stream gauge can be found in the site. 162 163.6 -77.2 -77.8 0 1000 meter"

00003-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations and datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database."

It was transferred to INSTAAR in late 1997, where it was stored in a Microsoft Access database, and presented on the web in ascii, comma delimited files. In October, 1999 Mike Gooseff submitted the 1997-98 data to Denise Steigerwald (the data manager) in ascii, comma delimited files. In order to prepare the files for use in an Oracle database as well as a geographic information system, Denise created a field for 'strmgageid' (stream gage id), converted any time fields of 24:00 to 0:00 on the following day, combined the date and time fields into one date/time field, and separated the data into separate files for each station. Data which was previously presented according to decade collected is now presented according to location, and contains records from the start date of monitoring for a given stream gage. The resulting files are available through the links provided above. In order to make the data more relational / useful in Oracle and ArcInfo, and generate links between different data and metadata fields, a dataset code was added to these files. New codes for the COMMENTS column were created in 2005 after a meeting between the stream team and the information manager (Chris Gardner). These comments were added to stream data that were worked up after that point - they usually appear in the data around the 2003 season. Inigo San Gil introduced metadata enhancements in 2014. Publication date, fixed typo, attribute level fixes, entity description, correct entity names, better markup, associated parties, DOI citation, missing values, etc."

This is part of a collection of 221 Baltimore Ecosystem Study metadata records that point to a geodatabase. The geodatabase is available online and is considerably large. Upon request, and under certain arrangements, it can be shipped on media, such as a usb hard drive. The geodatabase is roughly 51.4 Gb in size, consisting of 4,914 files in 160 folders. Although this metadata record and the others like it are not rich with attributes, it is nonetheless made available because the data that it represents could be indeed useful."

Surface soils to 2.5 cm have been analyzed from Everglades and mangrove sites; sediments to 30 cm have been analyzed from Florida Bay sites. Soils and sediments were analyzed for a suite of physical/chemical variables, including bulk density, organic matter content, extractable iron, AVS and CRS sulfur, and various forms of extractable phosphorus. These analyses are completed to document the differences in soil structure among transect sites, and to provide a baseline dataset against which long-term changes in the physical/chemical properties of the soils can be detected."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Three 1 m2 plots are placed on each site. The sites are measured every two months. The number of sawgrass plants is counted for each 1 m2 plot and one third or a minimum of fifteen plants is measured. For each measured plant, measurements of the total number of live leaves, length of the live leaves, and culm diameter at the base are taken. From these measurements we calculate the average leaf length, and the sum of the length of the leaves. We created a model for biomass using a stepwise regression to see which of the variables measured and calculated are more correlated to explain plant biomass. Obtaining the mean biomass for the plants within the plot and multiplying it by the number of plants counted in the plot calculates biomass for each plot. The total biomass for each plot is summed with the other two plots in the same site, and they are averaged to obtain one biomass number per site. To validate our model, plant clippings are obtained in which four plants are clipped (small, medium, large, inflorescence) from each site. The same measurements are applied to the clipped plants as those applied to the measured plants in the plots. The plant clippings are oven dried at 70 degrees C and weighed."

For each measured plant, measurements of the total number of live leaves, length of the live leaves, and culm diameter of the live leaves at the base are taken. From these measurements we calculate the average leaf length, and the sum of the length of the leaves. We created a model for biomass using a stepwise regression to see which of the variables measured and calculated are more correlated to explain plant biomass. Obtaining the mean biomass for the plants within the plot and multiplying it by the number of plants counted in the plot calculates biomass for each plot. The total biomass for each plot is summed with the other two plots in the same site, and they are averaged to obtain one biomass number per site. To validate our model, plant clippings are obtained in which four plants are clipped (small, medium, large, inflorescence) from each site.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

There are a total of 21 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle.-81.07794623-80.4897820725.7614517124.912934922000-05-012006-04-30FCE LTER (Dan Childers) Water Quality, Productivity, Soil nutrients/physical characteristics, and physical dataDanielChildersFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of Biological SciencesFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkOE 167MiamiFL33199USA305-348-3101305-348-1986childers@fiu.eduLead Principal InvestigatorFor SRS1(a, b, c), SRS2, and SRS3 collections of samples for Water Quality, Productivity, Soil nutrients/physical characteristics, and physical data (rainfall/water level) are used to help answer key FCE-LTER questions.For SRS4, SRS5, and SRS6 collections of samples for Water Quality and physical data (water level) are used to help answer key FCE-LTER questions.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514Dan Childer's FCE LTER sub project study area is located in Shark River Slough, South Florida, in Everglades National Park.-81.078-80.57425.76125.3652000-05-012006-04-30"

00008-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important, but often neglected, component of lake ecosystems. It is ecologically valuable because it creates littoral habitat complexity but it is susceptible to manipulation by riparian process, in particular removal by property owners. The objective of this study is to determine the spatial scales at which human and environmental factors contribute to coarse woody debris input and output dynamics. Coarse woody debris, boat docks, and riparian trees (with the potential of becoming CWD) around the five lakes of the NTL-LTER site (Trout Lake, Allequash Lake (north basin), Sparkling Lake, Crystal Lake, and Big Muskellunge Lake) were measured in 1996 and 1997. Boat docks were located on all 5 lakes. Docks were verified in 1997 using digital orthophotos. GPS positions were adjusted to coincide with the photos. Many of the docks were photographed with a digital camera."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

00012-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In North America, anthropogenic activities such as fossil fuel combustion and high-intensity agriculture have increased the inputs of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere far above natural, biogenic inputs. The effect of this excess N depends on how it is distributed through the environment. If fixed N is deposited as nitrate in forests, it may act as a 'fertilizer', stimulating growth and thus enhancing carbon sequestration. But when accumulated deposition exceeds the nutritional needs of the ecosystem, nitrogen saturation may result. Soil fertility declines due to leaching of cations and thus, carbon uptake diminishes. The balance between fertilization and saturation depends on the spatial and temporal extent of nitrogen deposition. Measurements of nitrogen oxide concentrations and fluxes made at Harvard Forest are intended to quantify the deposition of nitrogen oxides and to examine the rates for oxidation and deposition of reactive nitrogen that are critical in controlling how far the influence of nitrogen oxide emission sources extends. Measurements made to date indicate that dry deposition of NOy to the Harvard Forest canopy is controlled by advection from source regions, vertical mixing, and chemical reaction. The input is about equally divided between wet and dry deposition depending on the amount of precipitation. Southwesterly winds bring air from the major urban areas along the mid-Atlantic coast, whereas northwesterly wind bring air from less populated regions of northern New England and Canada. As a result, southwesterly winds transport higher concentrations and fluxes of NOx and NOy than northwesterly winds. In the summer, aerodynamically rough forests intercept NOx and emit reactive hydrocarbons that accelerate the oxidation of NOx to rapidly depositing species. As a result, much of the NOx emitted by North America is retained by the region in the summer. This deposition leads to a summertime decrease in reactive nitrogen concentrations and fluxes relative to spring levels. In addition to their role as a plant nutrient, nitrogen oxides are a major precursor for photochemical production of tropospheric ozone, a pollutant and greenhouse gas. Measurements at Harvard Forest are used to examine the interannual variability and trends in ozone production and background ozone concentrations. The family of nitrogen oxide species is partitioned between active radicals (NOx, NO3), reservoir species (e.g., peroxyacetylnitrate PAN) which can convert back into NO2 and terminal species (HNO3, organic nitrates), which no longer contribute to photochemistry and are efficiently deposited. At low wintertime temperatures, PAN is stable and can be transported to the upper troposphere and remote regions. In the summer, however, the lifetime of PAN is short (few hours) so concentrations may remain low despite abundant photochemical radicals that promote PAN formation. Thus, temperature directly affects the partitioning of nitrogen oxides, which will in turn affect deposition. Further measurements resolving key species are needed to distinguish the contributions due to direct NO2 deposition, HNO3 deposition and organic nitrate deposition. A dual Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectrometer (TDLAS) for eddy covariance flux measurements of NO2 and concentrations of HNO3 and NO2 has been operational since 1999 and a new CG/ECD for continuous measurement of PAN was installed in the spring of 2000. The combination of HNO3 and NO2 concentrations with existing measurements of O3, NOy, NO, PAN, hydrocarbons, tracers of anthropogenic emissions, and meteorological parameters at the site, provide important new data on the speciation and removal mechanisms for reactive nitrogen in the troposphere and subsequently the photochemistry of ozone in both urban and rural air masses. Simultaneous NOy, NOx, PAN and CO data will allow us to distinguish PAN deposition (loss of NOy) from PAN decomposition (leads to NOx increase, no change in NOy). Because seasonal cycles of PAN loss and formation remain a major uncertainty in understanding atmospheric transport and N deposition, we plan to continue measurements of NOy speciation over several seasonal cycles and climactic variation. The addition of PAN and HNO3 measurements provides a comprehensive analysis of the reactive nitrogen at this site, allowing us to examine the diel and seasonal trends in concentrations to determine their production, deposition, and loss rates."

00012-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Total nitrogen oxides (NOy) is determined by catalytic conversion on a hot gold catalyst and detection using a fast response chemiluminescence analyzer. The NOy catalyst is mounted at 29 m. The analyzer is calibrated by addition of NO and NO2 standards at the catalyst inlet. NO and NO2 are determined using a chemiluminescence analyzer with photolytic conversion of NO2 to NO. The analyzer seqeuentially samples from 8 inlet heights to define a concentration profile. Instrument response and photolysis efficiency are determined by addition of calibration standards to the inlet line. O3 concentration profiles are measured by a UV-absorbance instrument. O3 fluxes and continuous concentrations at 29 m are determined using a fast-response C2H4-chemiluminescence analyzer. CO at 29 m is determined using a modified IR-absorbtion gas-filter correlation analyzer. The sample stream is dried to a dewpoint of less than -20C in a cold trap to eliminate interference by water vapor. The instrument zero is determined by removal of CO in the ambient air with a catalyst. The analyzer is calibrated using a 500 ppb absolute standard. C2-C6 hydrocarbons are determined by cryogenic trapping over liquid nitrogen, separation by gas chromatography and detection by FID. Concentrations are computed by ratioing to a neohexane internal standard. Peroxyacetylnitrate is determined using a gas chromatograph with electron capture detector. NO2 and HNO3 were determined using a two-channel tuneable diode laser absorption spectrometer mounted at the top of a canopy access scaffold tower. NO2 signal was combined with vertical wind velocities to compute an eddy covariance flux of NO2."

00013-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"I. Field Protocol Paired simultaneous zooplankton collections were made at each of two LTER sampling sites (BB and DD) in Town Creek every two weeks. Samples were taken 2-3 hours prior to a midday low tide. From Cruises 1 - 9 ( 1/20/81 - 5/15/81 ). Two plankton nets were towed from the stern of a small outboard boat simultaneously. The nets were deployed by two persons who released the nets from the moving boat while keeping tension on the tow ropes. Weights attached to the bridle chuck allowed the net to settle near the bottom before the forward motion of the boat moved the net forward. From that point the tow was 90 seconds in duration increasing boat speed at 30 second intervals, allowing an oblique pattern from bottom to surface. Due to continual difficulty with this method, beginning with cruise 10 ( 6/1/81 ), an alternate method of zooplankton collection was implemented. On station, a small outboard boat was anchored (bow into the ebb current) and two weighted closed 30 cm diameter plankton nets were lowered to the creek bottom via a metered nylon rope, and a messenger released to open the nets for fishing. An oblique collection of the water column was made, sampling the bottom, mid, and surface levels for prescribed time intervals (never more than 2 minutes at each level). The amount of water filtered was registered by a torpedo-shaped General Oceanics flow meter Model 2040 mounted in the mouth of each net. Readings were taken before and after each tow. To insure an optimal amount of water filtered (~4 cubic meters) a minimum of ~2000 flow meter revolutions was required before sample retrieval. In the event this minimum was not obtained, the nets were lowered back into the water and an adequate amount of water was filtered. Upon sample retrieval, the contents of the net were concentrated into a windowed cod end jar, poured into a 1 liter pre-labeled Nalgene jar, and preserved with 30 ml of 100 percent formalin, buffered and stained with Rose Bengal. Sample replicates were returned to the lab for analysis. Gear Description: Cruises 1 - 9 (1/20/81 - 5/15/81) Each zooplankton net had a 30 cm diameter mouth and a 102 cm cylindrical body followed by a 74 cm conical section which tapered to a 10 cm cod end mouth. The mesh size of the entire net was 153 micron Nytex. A bridle attached the 30 cm diameter stainless steel round mouth frame to a tow rope. The cod end was a PVC cylinder with a Nytex (153 micron) window. A General Oceanics flow meter Model 2040 was mounted just inside the net mouth, slightly off-center. Cruises 10 - 275 (6/1/81 - 10/31/92) The zooplankton collection apparatus consists of a 153 micron mesh Nytex plankton net (described above) mounted to an opening assembly. The opening apparatus consists of a series of three 45 cm long, 1' diameter, hollow, stainless steel bars. Installed near the ends of each bar were copper sleeves mounted perpendicular to the pipe length. Braided nylon line (1/4') ran through the sleeves and the apparatus was assembled such that the upper and lower bars were fixed with the middle bar sliding up and down along the nylon line. The net was mounted to the upper and middle bars allowing the net mouth to be closed, prior to deployment. A trip mechanism on the tow line was triggered by a messenger and the net opened. Each net was weighted with a 1/4 m long, 10 lb. stainless steel weight. At greatest depths, the net fished 1/2 m from the creek bottom. This distance prevented the nets from filling with large amounts of sand and fecal material. II. Lab Analysis Prior to counting, the entire sample was sieved, rinsed in fresh water and the formalin disposed of. The sample was then rinsed into a graduatedbeaker and volume brought to 200 ml. A 2 ml stempel pipet sub-sample was removed and placed in a gridded counting tray. All organisms greater than or equal to 153 micron were identified to appropriate taxon and/or life stage and enumerated using a Wild binocular microscope at 24X. Beginning with Cruise 81 ( 4/12/84 ), samples were counted using a Leitz Diavert inverted microscope at 16X. Adult copepods were identified to species and non-adult copepods to species/genus and developmental stage (naupliar or copepodid). Adult and developmental stages of other plankters were identified to phylum, class, or family (see zooplankton data sheet on file). Data were recorded as numbers/sub-sample to be later converted to numbers/cubic meter. Upon computation of the 2 ml sub-sample count, the entire sample was sieved through 1.0 mm mesh, rinsed and the 'larger' organisms identified and enumerated. The sample was recombined, stored in a labeled .25 l flint jar, preserved in a buffered 10 percent formalin solution stained with Rose Bengal. Samples were stored by cruise/date and station. III. Counts Raw counts of the 2ml sub-sample and the 1.0 mm sieved portion were recorded for all organisms encountered. Total numbers in the entire sample were calculated using Equation 1. The volume of water filtered was calculated with Equation 2. Concentrations of the taxa were then calculated using Equation 3. Data sheets were stored by cruise/date awaiting computer entry. Data were entered as concentrations (density; #/m3) based on the 2 ml sub-sample. Equation 1: Raw Count Na = 2 ml sub-sample count of organism a MF = Multiplication factor Na X MF = Ta (100 for LTER zpk) Ta = Total number of organism a Equation 2: Water Volume filtered r/t = revolutions per tow (r/t)/(r/m) x A(m2) = V(m3) r/m = flow meter calibration (revolutions per meter) A(m2) = Area of net V(m3) = volume of water filtered Equation 3: Concentration (density) Ta/V(m3) = #/m3Experimental DesignBecause previous field studies indicated that stage of tide and time of day affected organism abundance at the zooplankton stations, it was necessary to sample about every 14 days, keeping these variables 'constant'. Thus paired, simultaneous zooplankton tows were made, fishing the mid ebb tidal current, at the same sites, when the end of the ebbing tide occurred near noon. Replicated biweekly measurements were used to identify seasonal patterns of abundance for each taxon. Comparisons of abundance between years provided information on long term trends. Collection at a sandy, turbulent inlet and a major marsh creek location allowed for a comparison of two habitat types."

This distance prevented the nets from filling with large amounts of sand and fecal material. II. Lab Analysis Prior to counting, the entire sample was sieved, rinsed in fresh water and the formalin disposed of. The sample was then rinsed into a graduatedbeaker and volume brought to 200 ml. A 2 ml stempel pipet sub-sample was removed and placed in a gridded counting tray. All organisms greater than or equal to 153 micron were identified to appropriate taxon and/or life stage and enumerated using a Wild binocular microscope at 24X. Beginning with Cruise 81 ( 4/12/84 ), samples were counted using a Leitz Diavert inverted microscope at 16X. Adult copepods were identified to species and non-adult copepods to species/genus and developmental stage (naupliar or copepodid). Adult and developmental stages of other plankters were identified to phylum, class, or family (see zooplankton data sheet on file). Data were recorded as numbers/sub-sample to be later converted to numbers/cubic meter. Upon computation of the 2 ml sub-sample count, the entire sample was sieved through 1.0 mm mesh, rinsed and the 'larger' organisms identified and enumerated. The sample was recombined, stored in a labeled .25 l flint jar, preserved in a buffered 10 percent formalin solution stained with Rose Bengal. Samples were stored by cruise/date and station. III. Counts Raw counts of the 2ml sub-sample and the 1.0 mm sieved portion were recorded for all organisms encountered. Total numbers in the entire sample were calculated using Equation 1. The volume of water filtered was calculated with Equation 2. Concentrations of the taxa were then calculated using Equation 3. Data sheets were stored by cruise/date awaiting computer entry. Data were entered as concentrations (density; #/m3) based on the 2 ml sub-sample. Equation 1: Raw Count Na = 2 ml sub-sample count of organism a MF = Multiplication factor Na X MF = Ta (100 for LTER zpk) Ta = Total number of organism a Equation 2: Water Volume filtered r/t = revolutions per tow (r/t)/(r/m) x A(m2) = V(m3) r/m = flow meter calibration (revolutions per meter) A(m2) = Area of net V(m3) = volume of water filtered Equation 3: Concentration (density) Ta/V(m3) = #/m3Experimental DesignBecause previous field studies indicated that stage of tide and time of day affected organism abundance at the zooplankton stations, it was necessary to sample about every 14 days, keeping these variables 'constant'. Thus paired, simultaneous zooplankton tows were made, fishing the mid ebb tidal current, at the same sites, when the end of the ebbing tide occurred near noon. Replicated biweekly measurements were used to identify seasonal patterns of abundance for each taxon. Comparisons of abundance between years provided information on long term trends. Collection at a sandy, turbulent inlet and a major marsh creek location allowed for a comparison of two habitat types."

00013-metadata.xml,Resource Long Name,/eml:eml/dataset/title,"LTER Zooplankton sampling for North Inlet stations"
00013-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes and wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek. The North Inlet LTER site is located on the eastern shore of the Atlantic Ocean, in a small tidal estuary near Georgetown, South Carolina, U.S.A. Coordinates for the North Inlet estuary are latitude 79 degrees 10 minutes and longitude 33 degrees 11 minutes. Zooplankton collections were made at two locations in Town Creek, the major tidal creek in the North Inlet estuary. The DD site is located near the inlet mouth 10 m off the southern shore of Town Creek at a small drainage very near the former site of the Town Creek platform. The boat was anchored, bow into the ebbing tidal current, and the paired weighted zooplankton nets lowered to the bottom. Tows were taken shortly after mid-ebb (2-hours prior to low tide) when tidal velocities were swiftest, often exceeding 0.5 m/sec-1. Water depth averaged 4 m. The BB site is located approximately 2 km inshore from the inlet in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth of Boze's Creek. Tows, taken at mid-ebb, were fished at tidal velocities less than or equal to 0.5 m/sec-1. Water depth averaged 4 m. The BB collection site is located in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth of Boze's Creek. Town Creek is the main tidal creek in the North Inlet estuary and is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes. The creek banks are covered by large clusters of the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), shell rubble, and intermittent muddy flats. The BB zooplankton station average water depth at mid ebb is approximately 4 m. Tidal velocity averages 0.3 m/sec-1. Water clarity varies with water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity, duration, and rainfall. The creek bottom at this site is muddy clay covered by varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal matter. The DD collection site is characterized by a high energy, sandy or heavily scoured bottom habitat. Mid ebb water velocities can exceed 1.0 m/sec-1, re-suspending large amounts of sand and debris. Water clarity varies with water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity, duration, and rainfall. At both sites, Town Creek is a well-mixed, high salinity creek inundated by diurnal tides. Rain input, primarily runoff, depresses salinities briefly depending on the duration and frequency. Water temperatures mirror local air conditions; semi--temperate/tropical-79.2936-79.104233.35733.2125"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

The 1993-94, 1994-95, 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 data was submitted by Kathy Welch at the University of Alabama. 1996-97 and 1997-98 data was also submitted by Craig Wolf at Montana State University. Since there was some overlap between these files, the records from Montana State University were used. Only two of the records in the pH9697.txt file (from Kathy Welch at the University of Alabama) were added to this dataset since they were not in the files from Montana. The raw data files listed under 'file name' are the names of the original ascii text files used. Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager fine-tuned the location codes and limno runs to match those provided in the 'locations, dates, codes for lake chemistry, biology samples' file. The file was imported into Microsoft Access on INSTAAR's Unix system, and can currently be found there. The file was then exported in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) to present on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above. Information for the metadata was submitted by Craig Wolf at Montana State University in the MetapH9697.rtf file. The file was called up using Microsoft Word version 6.0, allowing its text to be used to create this page in html format."

Each subsample was placed in a 2-ml settling chamber with a 26 mm diameter and examined at x400 magnification. To get a representative count of relative species abundance, seven random fields (a total of 0.44 square mm) needed to be examined per subsample. Within each field, algae were identified to genus and species where possible (excluding diatoms, which were counted but not identified.) Percent cover was determined in each field by measuring the length and width of all specimens using an ocular micrometer. Cell 'depth' was also measured in order to estimate biovolume.

00021-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), Adelges tsugae, an introduced aphid-like insect from Asia, is expanding its range across the northeastern United States through the range of Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) and can severely reduce or eliminate this important late-successional species. As part of a study investigating stand- and landscape-level forest dynamics resulting from HWA infestation, we examined initial community response of eight T. canadensis stands in south-central Connecticut and then continued to monitor these stands every other year. Our major objectives were to assess mortality patterns in T. canadensis, evaluate subsequent changes in stand microenvironment, and relate these and stand composition to initial patterns of regeneration, understory response, and community reorganization. Tsuga canadensis damage varied broadly across the study area ranging from near zero to greater than 95 % mortality. All size and age classes sampled were attacked by HWA, although smaller trees exhibited higher mortality rates than larger trees. All remaining T. canadensis sampled in seven of the eight stands were infested with HWA and over 90 % suffered at least 50 % foliar loss. Since 1995, overstory and understory mortality has risen 5 to 15 % per year to overall values of 50 to 99%. There has been no sign of tree recovery and the health and vigor of remaining trees deteriorated in all infested stands. Results suggest that trees on some sites can remain alive for over 10 years following initial infestation and remain standing for 6 to 8 years following mortality. Substantial accumulations of downed woody debris have developed in stands with severe HWA damage. Canopy gaps created by HWA damage significantly increased the amount of light reaching the forest floor and resulted in rapid understory vegetation responses. Prolific Betula lenta (black birch) establishment occurred in stands with moderate to severe T. canadensis mortality. In addition, opportunistic herbaceous species (Erechtites hieracifolia, Phytolacca americana) and exotic species (Ailanthus altissima, Microstegium vimineum) have recently invaded these stands. Due to mortality from HWA, T. canadensis seedlings were scarce in sampled stands, suggesting that advance regeneration and seedbanks will not be important mechanisms for T. canadensis reestablishment. Tsuga canadensis cannot sprout following defoliation and has no apparent resistance to HWA. Tree-ring analysis of hardwood and declining hemlock trees, coupled with age-structure analysis of newly established birch saplings was effective in determining the timing of initial HWA impact in stands of unknown infestation date. Over the last 10 years, radial growth of hemlock declined precipitously in most stands, while oak and maple growth exhibited concomitant, large annual increases. Therefore, dramatic reductions in T. canadensis across broad geographical areas appear imminent if HWA dispersal continues unimpeded and no effective natural enemies of HWA are found."

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00022-metadata.xml,Project Description,/eml:eml/dataset/project,"Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (ARC LTER) Program John Hobbie The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7496 jhobbie@mbl.edu Lead PI Gus Shaver The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7496 gshaver@mbl.edu Lead PI Jim Laundre The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7496 arc_imr@mbl.edu Information Manager The goal of Arctic LTER project is to predict the future ecological characteristics of the site based upon our knowledge of the controls of ecosystem structure and function as exerted by physical setting and geologic factors, climatic factors, biotic factors, and the changes in fluxes of water and materials from land to water. To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00024-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"Lake Fryxell basin is formed by a moraine depression in a wider portion of the Taylor Valley. It has a number of moraine islands and shallower areas, as well as several relatively well developed deltas. The lake is fed by at least 10 meltwater streams with a total drainage catchment of 230 km2. The lake is dammed to the southwest by the Canada Glacier and is topographically closed. It is perennially ice covered; during summer months, an ice-free moat generally forms around much of the lake margin. Lake levels have risen ~2 m between 1971 and 1996. There are no surface outflows; the only known water loss is through ice ablation (evaporation, sublimation and physical scouring). Lake elevation: 18 m. Maximum depth: 20 m. Lake Hoare occupies a narrower portion of the Taylor Valley, dammed by the Canada Glacier. It would drain almost completely without this dam. There are a number of islands which may be related to an old terminal of Canada Glacier. The lake is fed primarily from direct runoff from the glacier, as well as meltwater streams. (Lake level rose ~1.5 m between 1972 and 1996). There are no surface outflows; the only known water loss is through ice ablation (evaporation, sublimation and physical scouring). Lake elevation: 73 m. Maximum depth: 34 m. Lake Vanda is located in the Wright Valley, adjacent to the Taylor Valley. It is fed primarily by the Onyx River, which has its origin at Lake Brownworth, and ultimately at the Lower Wright Glacier located ~27 km east of the lake. The lake has no outflow. Lake elevation: 143 m. Maximum depth: 75 m. Pony Lake on Ross Island is located on Cape Royds. It is a shallow pond ~120 m long, 70 m wide, and 1-2 m deep. Huts built by Shakleton's expedition of 1908 face the southern end of the pond. The eastern shore of Pony Lake is adjacent to a penguin rookery and the pond has high nutrient concentrations. High levels of Na, Cl, and SO4 are probably due to the marine influence. The water is well mixed by strong winds that prevail at the cape. Don Quixote Pond (informal name) is located south of Lake Vanda in the Wright Valley. 162 163.6 -77.2 -77.8 0 1000 meter"

00025-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important, but often neglected, component of lake ecosystems. It is ecologically valuable because it creates littoral habitat complexity but it is susceptible to manipulation by riparian process, in particular removal by property owners. The objective of this study is to determine the spatial scales at which human and environmental factors contribute to coarse woody debris input and output dynamics. Coarse woody debris, boat docks, and riparian trees (with the potential of becoming CWD) around the five lakes of the NTL-LTER site (Trout Lake, Allequash Lake (north basin), Sparkling Lake, Crystal Lake, and Big Muskellunge Lake) were measured in 1996 and 1997. Boat docks were located on all 5 lakes. Docks were verified in 1997 using digital orthophotos. GPS positions were adjusted to coincide with the photos. Many of the docks were photographed with a digital camera."

Data are presented in terms of grams dry and ash-free dry mass per area per time. This is part of continuous data collection to test the hypothesis that phosphorus and nitrogen limit productivity at the upstream and downstream ends, respectively, of the FCE transects. Conclusions await longer-term data collection."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

00028-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"We measured shoot architecture, photosynthesis, survival and growth by seedlings of three shade-tolerant species of maple (Acer pensylvanicum, A. rubrum, A. saccharum) in an experimental test of the gap partitioning hypothesis. Trees were felled to create a total of six cleared, elliptical canopy gaps of two sizes (8m x 12m, 75m2; 16m x 24m, 300m2). Naturally-established, undamaged, unbranched seedlings (15-30 cm tall, 10-20+ years old) of the three study species (2160 total, 720 per species) were transplanted into five plot locations (center and NW, NE, SW, and SE gap edges) within all six gaps and matching understory sites one year before gap creation. All plots were weeded regularly and spaded annually along the edges to remove above and below-ground competition. Measurements of microclimates and non-competitive seedling responses were made over one year before and two years following gap release. Architectural variation increased greatly over the two-year period. Striped maple (A. pensylvanicum) and red maple (A. rubrum) increased branch numbers, leaf numbers, and total leaf areas in gaps, especially large gaps, while sugar maple (A. saccharum) showed much smaller changes. Red maple tended to increase the number of leaves while leaf size decreased; striped maple increased leaf number but held leaf size constant. Diurnal patterns of photosynthesis differed within and between gap and understory sites. Red maple showed higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area than striped and sugar maple in all site/plot combinations except the large gap south plots, where striped maple exceeded red maple. Estimated diurnal shoot-level assimilation differentiated species more than unit area assimilation rates, and also altered the rank order of performance, with striped maple above red maple above sugar maple in all microsites except the large gap north. Population-level assimilation versus irradiance response curves exhibited a similar pattern, with red maple dominating unit area rates in most plot microsites. In contrast, shoot assimilation curves showed striped maple above red maple above sugar maple in all microsites except the large gap north, where red maple exceeded striped maple. Architectural variation among these species interacted with leaf-level assimilation rates to produce some differences among these species in shoot-level assimilation across the gap-understory microclimatic gradient. Because survival and growth patterns are usually correlated with differences in whole-plant carbon assimilation, the results suggested that the potential for gap partitioning among the three maple species. Red maple survived better overall across the study due to greater persistence in the north and center plots of large gaps. The small gaps and understories showed no differences among the species. Survival rates exceeded 80% in most sites and plots, with low values (30-56%) only in the exposed plots of large gaps. There were no relationships between post-gap survival and previous age, height, or basal diameter. By the end of two years of gap release, both gap sizes induced greater distinctions among the species in all growth variables than the understory. Striped maple exhibited greater leader extension, absolute stem height, net height change, absolute basal diameter, and net basal diameter change than red maple and sugar maple (in that order) in nearly all sites and plots. The exception was large gap center and north plots, where red maple equaled or exceeded striped maple in net basal diameter change but not net height increase. Sugar maple was the least responsive of the species to the gap-understory gradient. As with survival, there were no predictable relationships between pre-gap age or size and post-gap growth. A considerable amount of leader (mainstem terminus) damage occurred during the study due to unknown causes. Architectural and growth analyses were done separately on undamaged seedlings versus those that had experienced leader damage and recovery. For all species combined, survival decreased while the frequency of leader damage among survivors increased across the gradient of microsite exposure. Red maple showed the highest survival (65-93%) but also very high leader damage (80-97%). Striped maple showed fairly high survival (81-93%) in all but the most exposed microsites (24-36%) and had the lowest leader damage overall (17-44%). Sugar maple was intermediate for both survival (25-86%) and leader damage (55-96%). Growth differed significantly among sites and species. Both intact and damaged plants showed greater growth in gaps than in understory, particularly in large gaps. For most growth variables in most microsites, striped maple equalled or exceeded red maple which equaled or exceeded sugar maple when plants were intact, but red maple equaled or exceeded striped maple which exceeded sugar maple when damaged. Species differences in growth varied among sites, with large gaps produced more pronounced effects than small gaps and understory for both intact and damaged plants. Growth recovery was inversely related to leader damage frequency among species, and thus at least partially offset the effects of damage on net growth across the populations. Photosynthetic performance paralleled growth by these species across the gradient, particularly for shoot assimilation. When growth variables were plotted against irradiance and temperature measured at seedling plot positions, there were consistent and clear distinctions among species across the gap-understory gradient, providing limited evidence for gap partitioning in our system for undamaged plants. Striped maple appears to be a superior generalist, red maple is a weaker generalist, and sugar maple shows the poorest performance in a manner that is nearly insensitive to the gap-understory gradient. Leader damage in the understory prior to gap formation would reinforce this pattern of relative performance by favoring striped maple. However, damaged red maple seedlings show a decisive advantage in recovery and regrowth in the large gap centers, where the probability of a juvenile trees capturing canopy gap space is highest."

00028-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Three large (300 m2) and three small (75 m2) canopy gaps were created in October 1987 by felling overstory trees across a 4-ha study area in the Prospect Hill 7 tract of the Harvard Forest. All gaps were elliptical with the long axis oriented east-west. Three large and three small understory sites were intermingled among the gaps. The twelve sites were divided into three blocks, with each block containing a large gap , small gap, large understory, and small understory site. Five seedling plots (1 x 2 m) were established in the gap centers and on the NW, NE, SW, and SE gap edges in advance of the tree felling. Five plots with the same geometric layout were also established in each of the understory sites. Gap and understory microclimates were measured for 3-5 days every other week during 1988 and 1989. Micromet stations were placed on the north edge of each of the 5 seedling plots in one large gap, one small gap, and one large understory site. Photosynthetic photon flux, air temperature (25 cm), and soil temperature at two depths (1 cm, 15 cm) were sampled simultaneously in all three sites every 10 seconds, and means were recorded every 10 minutes across 24-hour periods. Diurnal traces were plotted and also condensed to 12-hr daily totals, means, and standard errors. Most data analysis was focused on 5 clear, 5 overcast, and 10 combined (clear + overcast) days spread across the May-September growing season in 1989. The 2160 seedlings were transplanted from other sites in the Harvard Forest into the twelve understory and future gap sites in late fall 1986. The canopy gaps were created one year later after a growing season of acclimation to the understory, End-of-season seedling survival and growth (height, mainstem extension, branch growth, and basal diameter growth) were recorded one year before and two years following gap release. Shoot architecture was measured on a subset of 540 undamaged seedlings. These seedlings were selected in fall 1987 as representative of the complete set of 2160 seedlings based on morphological and age data. The 540 plants include 3 seedlings per species per plot per site per block across the experiment. Stem height, number of leaves, and leaf lengths were measured on several occasions annually in 1987-89. A subset of seedlings was selected for photosynthesis measurements on the north and south sides of one large gap, one small gap, and one large understory site in block 1 of the experiment. Sampling was scheduled such that all species were represented equally across sites and plots on each day of measurements. Diurnal patterns of leaf-level photosynthetic rates were measured in all sites on several days. Leaf-level rates were scaled to estimated shoot photosynthesis by combining shoot architectural data with photosynthetic rates measured on multiple leaf pairs on a random subset of seedlings for each species. Population-level light response curves were constructed for each species in each site from scatterplots of all measurements made across the growing season . The population curves were plotted for both leaf-level rates and estimated shoot photosynthesis."

00028-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Three large (300 m2) and three small (75 m2) canopy gaps were created in October 1987 by felling overstory trees across a 4-ha study area in the Prospect Hill 7 tract of the Harvard Forest. All gaps were elliptical with the long axis oriented east-west. Three large and three small understory sites were intermingled among the gaps. The twelve sites were divided into three blocks, with each block containing a large gap , small gap, large understory, and small understory site. Five seedling plots (1 x 2 m) were established in the gap centers and on the NW, NE, SW, and SE gap edges in advance of the tree felling. Five plots with the same geometric layout were also established in each of the understory sites. Gap and understory microclimates were measured for 3-5 days every other week during 1988 and 1989. Micromet stations were placed on the north edge of each of the 5 seedling plots in one large gap, one small gap, and one large understory site. Photosynthetic photon flux, air temperature (25 cm), and soil temperature at two depths (1 cm, 15 cm) were sampled simultaneously in all three sites every 10 seconds, and means were recorded every 10 minutes across 24-hour periods. Diurnal traces were plotted and also condensed to 12-hr daily totals, means, and standard errors. Most data analysis was focused on 5 clear, 5 overcast, and 10 combined (clear + overcast) days spread across the May-September growing season in 1989. The 2160 seedlings were transplanted from other sites in the Harvard Forest into the twelve understory and future gap sites in late fall 1986. The canopy gaps were created one year later after a growing season of acclimation to the understory, End-of-season seedling survival and growth (height, mainstem extension, branch growth, and basal diameter growth) were recorded one year before and two years following gap release. Shoot architecture was measured on a subset of 540 undamaged seedlings. These seedlings were selected in fall 1987 as representative of the complete set of 2160 seedlings based on morphological and age data. The 540 plants include 3 seedlings per species per plot per site per block across the experiment. Stem height, number of leaves, and leaf lengths were measured on several occasions annually in 1987-89. A subset of seedlings was selected for photosynthesis measurements on the north and south sides of one large gap, one small gap, and one large understory site in block 1 of the experiment. Sampling was scheduled such that all species were represented equally across sites and plots on each day of measurements. Diurnal patterns of leaf-level photosynthetic rates were measured in all sites on several days. Leaf-level rates were scaled to estimated shoot photosynthesis by combining shoot architectural data with photosynthetic rates measured on multiple leaf pairs on a random subset of seedlings for each species. Population-level light response curves were constructed for each species in each site from scatterplots of all measurements made across the growing season . The population curves were plotted for both leaf-level rates and estimated shoot photosynthesis."

Until then, the soils were stored in a 4_C refrigerator. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at 5C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening . A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum soil can, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105C for 24 hours.

Very large rocks (>20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at 4C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum soil can, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105C for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil."

The Trout Lake buoy is also equipped with meteorological sensors that provide fundamental information on lake thermal structure and weather conditions. An acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) is associated with this buoy. Data are usually collected every 10 minutes with occasional periods of 2 minute data for short periods to answer specific questions. After correcting for flux to or from the atmosphere and vertical mixing within the water column, high frequency measurements of dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen can be used to estimate gross primary productivity, respiration, and net ecosystem productivity, the basic components of whole lake metabolism. Sampling Frequency: varies for instantaneous sample. averaged to hourly and daily values from one minute samples Number of sites: 1"

00036-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The instrumented buoy on Lake Mendota is equipped with a dissolved oxygen sensor, a thermistor chain, and meteorological sensors that provide fundamental information on lake thermal structure, weather conditions, and lake metabolism. Data are collected every minute. Hourly and daily averages for water temperatures are derived from the high resolution data. The D-Opto dissolved oxygen sensor is 0.5m from the lake surface. In 2006, the thermistors were placed every 0.5 m from the surface through 7m and every 1m from 7m to 15m. In 2007 and 2008, the thermistors were placed every 0.5 m from the surface through 2m and every 1m from 2m to 20m. Meteorological sensors measure wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity, air temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and barometric pressure. Not all sensors are deployed each season. After correcting for flux to or from the atmosphere and vertical mixing within the water column, high frequency measurements of dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and oxygen can be used to estimate gross primary productivity, respiration, and net ecosystem productivity, the basic components of whole lake metabolism. The instrumented buoy was deployed in Lake Mendota in 2006 from June 27 to October 17. In 2007, from May 18 to October 29. In 2008, from 26 Jun to 14 Nov. In 2009, the buoy was deployed from April 17 to Nov 23. In 2009, the Mendota buoy was located at 43.0995, -89.4045. (Click for Map) Sampling Frequency: one minute. Number of sites: 1"

00038-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The widespread influence of land use and natural disturbance on population, community, and landscape dynamics and the long-term legacy of disturbance on modern ecosystems requires that a historical, broad-scale perspective become an integral part of modern ecological studies and conservation assessment and planning. In previous studies, the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has developed an integrated approach of paleoecological and historical reconstruction, meteorological modeling, air photo interpretation, GIS analyses, and field studies of vegetation and soils, to address fundamental ecological questions concerning the rates, direction, and causes of vegetation change, to evaluate controls over modern species and community distributions and landscape patterns, and to provide critical background for conservation and restoration planning. In the current study, we extend this approach to investigate the link between landscape history and the abundance, distribution, and dynamics of species, communities and landscapes of the Cape Cod to Long Island coastal region, including the islands of Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Block Island. The study region includes many areas of high conservation priority that are linked geographically, historically, and ecologically. Despite the compelling rationale for examining this coastal region as a whole and for comparing its related, though distinctive geographic areas, an integrated and comprehensive study of the region has never been undertaken. We are investigating regional controls over landscape patterns and community distribution and will focus in detail on the dynamics of sandplain communities, including grasslands, heathlands, barrens, and woodlands, which are unique components of this region and high priorities for conservation. In order to determine the historical and modern abundance and distribution of these community types, and to relate these to historical patterns of land use, fire, windstorms and other disturbances, we are developing: (1) GIS-based, spatially explicit maps of land use, land cover, environment, hurricane characteristics, and cultural features across the region for the historical period (17th C to present), (2) pollen and charcoal diagrams for critical areas where data are currently unavailable and an integrated analysis of data from all studies across this region, (3) analysis of the relationship between high priority communities (sandplain grasslands, heathlands, barrens, and related communities), rare species, and disturbance history, (4) revised conceptual ecological models for sandplain communities and recommendations for ecological goals and management approaches."

00038-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Species List The data file lists all taxa recorded in the sample plots. Taxonomy follows Gleason and Cronquist (1991). In general, codes are formed by taking the first four letters of the genus name and the first three letters of the species name. Where this causes confusion, an eight letter code unique to each taxon is used. Plot Locations Plots are identified by a general location code (2-3 letters) and a plot number (1-999). These two identifiers are also combined into a single six-character code. Because the plots were sampled from a larger set of potential plot locations, plot numbers are not necessarily sequential. Total number of plots = 776 (270 in 1999, 389 in 2000, 117 in 2001). Soil Chemistry For plots sampled in 1999 (CJ series), the two pairs of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples were subsampled (1/8 cup per sample) and combined to make a single composite sample representing the plot, which was then sent to Brookside Labs. For plots sampled in 2000, only one set of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples was collected, and ¼ cup of each was mixed to produce a composite 0-30 cm sample sent for analysis. In some samples, concentrations of certain cations were below the detection limit of the analytical equipment; in these cases, concentrations are listed as “less than x ppm.” Before the soils data can be analyzed quantitatively, these entries will need to be replaced by numerical values. There are no lab soils data for two plots sampled in 2000 (MT 50 and PB 14). Plant Cover Cover of all vascular plant species rooted within the 20 x 20 m plot (also total lichen and bryophyte cover) was estimated on an eight-point scale. Tree Diameters Diameters of all live trees at least 2.5 cm dbh and all standing dead stems at least 10 cm dbh were measured in all plots. Only truly arboreal species were measured; shrubs such as scrub oak and viburnum were not, although individuals of these species routinely exceeded 2.5 cm dbh. Tree Cores One to three cores of the largest sound trees were sampled in plots with trees greater than 5 cm dbh. Cores were taken at 30 cm above the ground. Most cores were mounted, sanded, and counted under a hand lens or microscope. Some cores of young trees were counted in the field and not collected."

00038-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Species List The data file lists all taxa recorded in the sample plots. Taxonomy follows Gleason and Cronquist (1991). In general, codes are formed by taking the first four letters of the genus name and the first three letters of the species name. Where this causes confusion, an eight letter code unique to each taxon is used. Plot Locations Plots are identified by a general location code (2-3 letters) and a plot number (1-999). These two identifiers are also combined into a single six-character code. Because the plots were sampled from a larger set of potential plot locations, plot numbers are not necessarily sequential. Total number of plots = 776 (270 in 1999, 389 in 2000, 117 in 2001). Soil Chemistry For plots sampled in 1999 (CJ series), the two pairs of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples were subsampled (1/8 cup per sample) and combined to make a single composite sample representing the plot, which was then sent to Brookside Labs. For plots sampled in 2000, only one set of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples was collected, and ¼ cup of each was mixed to produce a composite 0-30 cm sample sent for analysis. In some samples, concentrations of certain cations were below the detection limit of the analytical equipment; in these cases, concentrations are listed as “less than x ppm.” Before the soils data can be analyzed quantitatively, these entries will need to be replaced by numerical values. There are no lab soils data for two plots sampled in 2000 (MT 50 and PB 14). Plant Cover Cover of all vascular plant species rooted within the 20 x 20 m plot (also total lichen and bryophyte cover) was estimated on an eight-point scale. Tree Diameters Diameters of all live trees at least 2.5 cm dbh and all standing dead stems at least 10 cm dbh were measured in all plots. Only truly arboreal species were measured; shrubs such as scrub oak and viburnum were not, although individuals of these species routinely exceeded 2.5 cm dbh. Tree Cores One to three cores of the largest sound trees were sampled in plots with trees greater than 5 cm dbh. Cores were taken at 30 cm above the ground. Most cores were mounted, sanded, and counted under a hand lens or microscope. Some cores of young trees were counted in the field and not collected."

Deeper contours are based on piezometric water level. Thus volume calculations within the ice cover represent volumes of liquid water as if the ice was melted. Third order polynomial equations were fit to the area vs. depth data both from Schmok's report and from the digitized map data, using SigmaPlot's curve fitting routine. However, since the contour data are already a 'best-fit' of measured depth data, and contour intervals are relatively small, it was decided to linearly interpolate the depth:area relationships for depths between the measured depth contours, at 0.5m intervals. Volume was calculated for each 0.5m increment as a truncated cone (V=(h/3)*(A1+A2+sqrt(A1*A2))."

In contrast, Lake Hoare is unstratified during the summer and is freshwater. It has a maximum depth of 34m. Summer temperatures in the water column ranged between 0.01 degrees C and 1.0 degrees C. Lake Bonney, West Lake Bonney, Lake Vanda, Lake Vida, Lake Joyce, Don Juan Pond and Lake Miers are also in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica.162163.6-77.2-77.801000meter"

This is part of a collection of 221 Baltimore Ecosystem Study metadata records that point to a geodatabase. The geodatabase is available online and is considerably large. Upon request, and under certain arrangements, it can be shipped on media, such as a usb hard drive. The geodatabase is roughly 51.4 Gb in size, consisting of 4,914 files in 160 folders. Although this metadata record and the others like it are not rich with attributes, it is nonetheless made available because the data that it represents could be indeed useful."

00041-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations and datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database. Aquarius software replaced ADAPS for streamflow workouts in 2012."

It was first stored in an INGRES database, but was converted to ORACLE format in early 1996. Modifications were generally made each year after the initial creation in the early part of the year. It was transferred to INSTAAR in late 1997, where it was stored in a Microsoft Access database, and presented on the web in ascii, comma delimited files. In October, 1999 Mike Gooseff submitted the 1997-98 data to Denise Steigerwald (the data manager) in ascii, comma delimited files. In order to prepare the files for use in an Oracle database as well as a geographic information system, Denise created a field for 'strmgageid' (stream gage id), converted any time fields of 24:00 to 0:00 on the following day, combined the date and time fields into one date/time field, and separated the data into separate files for each station. Data which was previously presented according to decade collected is now presented according to location, and contains records from the start date of monitoring for a given stream gage. The resulting files are available through the links provided above. In order to make the data more relational / useful in Oracle and ArcInfo, and generate links between different data and metadata fields, a dataset code was added to these files. The field notes indicate that the station was buried in snow during the 1994-95 season. We cannot offer hydrology data for the 1994-95 season, as no water flow was recorded.

Preliminary data is available upon request, but will be superseded by final data. Please email mcmdata@lternet.edu with your detailed request for preliminary discharge data. New codes for the COMMENTS column were created in 2005 after a meeting between the stream team and the information manager (Chris Gardner). These comments were added to stream data that were worked up after that point - they usually appear in the data around the 2003 season. Inigo San Gil introduced metadata enhancements in 2014."

00042-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"1999"
00042-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The soil warming experiment was installed on the Prospect Hill tract in 1991 to allow us to investigate the effects of a 5 deg C temperature increase on soil processes fundamental to the global cycling of carbon and nitrogen. The experiment is located in an even-aged mixed hardwood forest. Six replicates of three treatments, Heated (resistance heating cables buried at 10cm and maintained at a 5 deg C differential from the control plots), Disturbance Control (cables installed but not powered) and Control treatments make up the randomized block design. The temperature differential is maintained with monitoring at five minute increments by an automated thermister network in the plots, wired to a multiplexer and a datalogger in the control shed. In the plots, measurements of trace gasses (CO2, N2O and CH4), nitrogen mineralization, soil moisture and soil water chemistry have allowed us to quantify changes in the soil system. Ten years of elevated soil temperatures at the Harvard Forest soil warming experiment suggest that there are limits to a positive feedback to the global warming cycle. After many early years of increased CO2 fluxes from the warmed plots, years nine and ten have revealed no significant differences in releases of CO2 between the heated and control plots. Nitrogen mineralization has shown a large response to warming as well, with twice the rate of N mineralized in years 1-4, followed by a gradual decrease in rates to about the 40% level in 1998. Resumption of mineralization measurements in 2001 reveal a continued decrease in mineralization rates. Field results from the soil warming experiment indicate that only a small fraction of the soil carbon in this mid-latitude forest ecosystem will be lost to the atmosphere in response to warming. We find that a 5 deg C warming of the soil for a decade results in a loss of about 11% of the carbon stored in the top 60 cm of soil, with most of this loss occurring in the first four to five years. By the end of the decade, warming no longer stimulates soil carbon loss. In addition, we find that warming accelerates the soil nitrogen cycle, particularly in the early years of warming. This acceleration has the potential to stimulate plant carbon storage. Calculations based on nitrogen uptake in vegetation at the Chronic N Experiment (Magill, Aber et al. 2000) allow us to estimate how much additional carbon might be stored in plants as a result increased N availability at soil warming. Our calculations show that the potential increase in carbon stored is large enough to more than compensate for the soil carbon loss, so that warming may actually stimulate carbon storage at the ecosystem level in this mid-latitude forest. We are currently expanding our research from the original soil warming experiment to investigate this important feedback at the Harvard Forest. The existing 6x6m plots on the Prospect Hill tract are not large enough to allow for the study of treatment effects on trees, so we are installing a larger warming experiment. The new experiment will have two 30x30m plots, a heated and a control plot, in the Slab City Tract of the Harvard Forest. Many aspects of this experiment will be the same as the original. Using resistance heating cables and thermisters, we will maintain a 5 deg C differential between the heated and control plots, year-round. In addition to the trace gas, nitrogen mineralization and soil water parameters measured to date, we will also be measuring woody increment and other vegetation metrics to allow us to investigate the plant response to perturbations in the carbon and nitrogen cycles."

Soil moisture measurements were conducted using gravimetric techniques for the first 4 years of the study and by time domain reflectometry (TDR) from 1995-2002. Net N mineralization and nitrification were measured for the forest floor and mineral soil using an on-site buried bag incubation. Incubations were for 6 weeks, April- November, and for 5 months through the winter. Initial samples were collected and analyzed for extractable (2N KCl, 48 hours) NH4+ and NO3- content. The same analysis was carried out on the incubated samples. The difference in total mineral N content between initial and incubated soils is the net mineralization rate. Concentrations of inorganic N in water leaching below the rooting zone were measured using high-tension lysimetry. Soil water samples were collected from one porous cup lysimeter per plot on two occasions every month for the first 2 years of the experiment, then monthly. Lysimeters were installed at a depth of 50 cm and evacuated to 15 in Hg 24 h before sampling. Samples were frozen until they were analyzed for NH4+ and NO3-."

00043-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The water column was sampled at the deepest point in each lake with a 2.21 Niskin bottle, through a hole drilled in thick ice cover (approximately 4m thick). Duplicate 60ml samples from each depth were fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde to a final concentration of 2% and stored in the dark at 4 degrees C prior to being analyzed for bacteria. For bacteria counts, 1-2ml samples were stained with DAPI (4', 6-diamindino-2-phenylindole), filtered onto 0.2 microm black polycarbonate membrane filters and then viewed under UV epifluorescence microscopy. Ten Whipple grids were counted on each filter and the mean value determined. For cryptophyte counts, 30-50ml of sample was stained with DAPI, filtered onto a 2.0 microm polycarbonate membrane filter and viewed under epifluorescence. Twenty Whipple grids were counted on each filter to determine mean abundance. Biomass values for bacteria were derived by measuring 100 cells on each preparation using a Patterson graticule at a magnification of x1600. Mean cell volumes were converted to carbon values by applying a conversion factor of 220fg C/microm3. Cryptophyte biomass was calculated by measuring 50 cells on each preparation. Biovolume was derived by applying an ellipsoid geometric shape and converted to carbon using a conversion figure of 220fg C/microm3. Flagellate ingestion rates were determined using fluorescently labelled bacteria (FLB). FLBs were prepared by labelling bacteria cultured from Lake Fryxell with DTAF [5-(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl) aminofluorscein]. Ingestion rates were measured in flagellates collected from 6m and 12m in Lake Hoare and 6m, 8m, and 9m in Lake Fryxell. Incubations were conducted in situ at the appropriate depths using 60ml acid rinsed Nalgene bottles. Duplicate 50ml samples were fixed with ice-cold 2% phosphate buffered glutaraldehyde (final concentration) after 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours and 3.5 hours. Samples were stained with DAPI filtered onto a 5 microm polycarbonate filter and viewed under epifluorescence microscopy. Four hundred cryptophyte cells were examined on each preparation, and the number of FLB in each cell recorded. Ingestion rates were calculated using the linear portion of the uptake curves."

00045-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The BES Household Survey 2003 is a telephone survey of metropolitan Baltimore residents consisting of 29 questions. The survey research firm, Hollander, Cohen, and McBride conducted the survey, asking respondents questions about their outdoor recreation activities, watershed knowledge, environmental behavior, neighborhood characteristics and quality of life, lawn maintenance, satisfaction with life, neighborhood, and the environment, and demographic information. The data from each respondent is also associated with a PRIZM(r) classification, census block group, and latitude-longitude. PRIZM(r) classifications categorize the American population using Census data, market research surveys, public opinion polls, and point-of-purchase receipts. The PRIZM(r) classification is spatially explicit allowing the survey data to be viewed and analyzed spatially and allowing specific neighborhood types to be identified and compared based on the survey data. The census block group and latitude-longitude data also allow us additional methods of presenting and analyzing the data spatially. The household survey is part of the core data collection of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study to classify and characterize social and ecological dimensions of neighborhoods (patches) over time and across space. This survey is linked to other core data including US Census data, remotely-sensed data, and field data collection, including the BES DemSoc Field Observation Survey. The BES 2003 telephone survey was conducted by Hollander, Cohen, and McBride from September 1-30, 2003. The sample was obtained from the professional sampling firm Claritas, in order that their 'PRIZM' encoding would be appended to each piece of sample (telephone number) supplied. Mailing addresses were also obtained so that a postcard could be sent in advance of interviewers calling. The postcard briefly informed potential respondents about the survey, who was conducting it, and that they might receive a phone call in the next few weeks. A stratified sampling method was used to obtain between 50 - 150 respondents in each of the 15 main PRIZM classifications. This allows direct comparison of PRIZM classifications. Analysis of the data for the general metropolitan Baltimore area must be weighted to match the population proportions normally found in the region. They obtained a total of 9000 telephone numbers in the sample. All 9,000 numbers were dialed but contact was only made on 4,880. 1508 completed an interview, 2524 refused immediately, 147 broke off/incomplete, 84 respondents had moved and were no longer in the correct location, and a qualified respondent was not available on 617 calls. This resulted in a response rate of 36.1% compared with a response rate of 28.2% in 2000. The CATI software (Computer Assisted Terminal Interviewing) randomized the random sample supplied, and was programmed for at least 3 attempted callbacks per number, with emphasis on pulling available callback sample prior to accessing uncalled numbers. Calling was conducted only during evening and weekend hours, when most head of households are home. The use of CATI facilitated stratified sampling on PRIZM classifications, centralized data collection, standardized interviewer training, and reduced the overall cost of primary data collection. Additionally, to reduce respondent burden, the questionnaire was revised to be concise, easy to understand, minimize the use of open-ended responses, and require an average of 15 minutes to complete. The household survey is part of the core data collection of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study to classify and characterize social and ecological dimensions of neighborhoods (patches) over time and across space. This survey is linked to other core data, including US Census data, remotely-sensed data, and field data collection, including the BES DemSoc Field Observation Survey. Additional documentation of this database is attached to this metadata and includes 4 documents, 1) the telephone survey, 2) documentation of the telephone survey, 3) metadata for the telephone survey, and 4) a description of the attribute data in the BES survey 2003 survey.This database was created by joining the GDT geographic database of US Census Block Group geographies for the Baltimore Metropolitan Statisticsal Area (MSA), with the Claritas PRIZM database, 2003, of unique classifications of each Census Block Group, and the unique PRIZM code for each respondent from the BES Household Telephone Survey, 2003. The GDT database is preferred and used because of its higher spatial accuracy than other databases describing US Census geographies, including those provided by the US Census. This database includes data only for environmental problems: In regard to the following environmental and quality of life issues, I'd like you to tell me if you consider it to be a major problem, somewhat of a problem, or not a problem in your neighborhood a) cleanliness of streets and sidewalks, b) availability of parks and open spaces, c) quality of parks and open spaces, d) safety and security, e) air quality, and f) water quality.' The response is the percentage of respondents in that Prizm class who had an index value in the 'somewhat a problem' or 'major problem' range for the index. This is part of a collection of 221 Baltimore Ecosystem Study metadata records that point to a geodatabase. The geodatabase is available online and is considerably large. Upon request, and under certain arrangements, it can be shipped on media, such as a usb hard drive. The geodatabase is roughly 51.4 Gb in size, consisting of 4,914 files in 160 folders. Although this metadata record and the others like it are not rich with attributes, it is nonetheless made available because the data that it represents could be indeed useful."

00047-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"1999"
00047-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The DIRT Experiment (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) is a long-term study of controls on soil organic matter formation. Our goal is to assess how rates and sources of plant litter inputs control the accumulation and dynamics of organic matter and nutrients in forest soils over decadal time scales. Results from 11 years of field and laboratory studies demonstrate the relative importance of above- and belowground sources on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics and show emerging long-term non-linear changes in soil carbon release and storage. Treatments established in a mixed hardwood stand in 1990 are: doubling annual aboveground litter (DL), exclusion of aboveground litter (NL), exclusion of root inputs by trenching (NR), and exclusion of aboveground litter and root inputs (NI), on replicated 3m x 3m plots (n=3 for treatments, 6 for controls). The O/A-less treatment, implemented in 1991, tracks the recovery of impoverished soil by replacing O and A horizon soil with B horizon material and allowing normal litter inputs thereafter. Comparison of data among treatments (soil respiration, soil solution chemistry, soil physical and chemical properties, and microfaunal and microbial community structure) allows us to determine the contributions of live roots, above-ground litter, and belowground detritus to SOM and nutrient dynamics in this forest soil. Similar experiments in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Oregon, and Hungarian forests provide information on these processes across climate and soil texture gradients. First-year soil respiration results from the Harvard Forest DIRT plots showed that live root respiration, production of aboveground litter (leaf, twig, other fine litter) and fine root detritus each constitute about one-third of C inputs to soil. Soil respiration is influenced more by root inputs than aboveground litter in this forest. CO2 efflux from root-excluded soils (NR, NI) declined to 32% of controls over the first 11 years of treatments as soil C became more recalcitrant. Excluding aboveground inputs (NI) had little additional negative effect when root inputs were excluded (NR). Doubling or excluding aboveground litter proportionally increased or decreased respiration, respectively, from root-intact soils during the first four years. However, after year 8, DL respiration dropped to near or below control levels, indicating decreasing decomposition rates. O/A-less soil respiration rates in year 11 surpassed the root-excluded treatments. C and N stocks respectively increased or decreased in response to doubling or excluding aboveground litter inputs to root-intact soil. However, stocks declined only slightly in NI soils relative to NR. Changes in soil respiration relative to total soil C mass indicate changing soil organic matter (SOM) quality across treatments and over time. Root inputs remain the stronger influence on the proportion of respired labile C, which declined to 40% of control levels in the root-free soils. Results suggest that aboveground inputs more strongly influence SOM mass, but root inputs have a stronger effect on SOM quality. 10 years of doubling litter inputs increased total soil C but by year 10 respired labile C declined below controls, demonstrating a long-term negative effect on decomposition. Total C in O/A-less soil did not increase markedly but the large labile proportion dropped by half as the young organic matter became more stabilized after 10 years of decomposition. Soil respiration response to soil temperature was strongly and significantly influenced by treatment, and treatment effects increased with time. Respiration by fine roots and associated rhizosphere organisms was more responsive to temperature than was bulk soil respiration. DL Q10 fell steadily from year 4 to year 11 as decomposition rates declined, and was below NL Q10 by year 10. NL Q10 changed little over time. NI Q10 decreased more than NR despite the fact that its respiration rates are similar to or greater than NR. Q10 for NI and NR decreased more over time than any other treatment. O/A-less soil Q10 increased over time, and was higher than the root-excluded treatments’ Q10 in year 11. Changes in soil solution organic chemistry required at least 5 years of litter manipulation. By year 7, forest floor DOC concentrations were significantly higher in DL plots and significantly lower in O/A-less plots. Response was mixed in the litter and/or root-excluded treatments. Mineral soil solution chemistry was not affected by treatments. The Oea horizon contributed 40% to forest floor soil solution DOC, leaf litter 44%, and root exudate and decay 16%. Roots appeared to be a sink for DON. Oea soil appears to contribute 107% and leaf litter 39% to forest floor soil solution DON. Mean annual DOC flux was strongly related to forest floor C:N ratio but DON flux was not. Mean annual DOC and DON fluxes were positively related to fungal biomass, suggesting that fungal biomass may be responsible for a large proportion of DOC and DON production. Seasonal changes in DOC:DON ratios in root-intact treatments DL, NL, and controls suggest a decoupling of DOC and DON production. Treatment patterns of DOC flux in year 7 correspond to cumulative DOC and CO2 release from incubated organic horizon soils collected in year 5, as did CO2 efflux measured in the field in year 8. DOC losses from the incubated forest floors were 10 percent of CO2-C gas losses. Total DIN mineralized in the incubated soils collected in year 5 was also influenced by treatments. Lack of net N mineralization response to variations in aboveground litter suggests that microbial immobilization exerts a strong control over soil N dynamics. Although net N mineralization rates were lower in soils from root-excluded plots, nitrification rates were much higher. Incubated soils from the Pennsylvania site showed similar results. These findings suggest that the absence of roots and mycorrhizal hyphae favor nitrifying bacteria. After 5 years of treatments, microflora appeared to follow patterns of carbon availability and recalcitrance. Data suggest that fungal:bacterial ratios decline with increasing recalcitrance of soil carbon. Total fungal biomass tended to follow patterns of C and N content, being highest in DL and lowest in NL and NI. Fungal biomass was much greater than bacterial biomass in all treatments, yet aboveground litter inputs may be more important substrates for fungi than are roots. Treatments did not affect the active biomass of fungi or bacteria in forest floors. That litter manipulations strongly affected N mineralization and respiration in laboratory incubated soils suggests that the activities of microbial functional types were influenced by treatments. However, microbial populations are poor predictors of process rates. In summary, results from field data and intersite soil incubations suggest that aboveground inputs exert a stronger influence on SOM mass, but root inputs have a stronger effect on its quality. The pool of turning over N is slow, having a different dynamic than the faster mineralizable C pool. Metabolism of roots and rhizosphere organisms is more temperature-sensitive than bulk soil organisms. Exclusion of roots had a greater effect on microbial processes than either doubling or excluding aboveground inputs. Declining decomposition rates accompanied by increasing soil C in the DL treatment suggests long-term non-linear changes in soil microbial activity which could lead to increased long-term soil C storage beyond expectations. Changes in above- and belowground plant inputs and their influence on temperature-controlled processes will be significant in determining the effects of a warmer world on the net flux of carbon from soils to the atmosphere."

00047-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Soil Bulk Density For sample processing details, see the information for soil sampling in 1991. This file 'HF DIRT in 1991' is listed in the Data Catalog under Sampling Information – Soils. Data given are expressed as Mg of oven-dry (105 deg C) soil per hectare. Data could not be expressed as wt/volume of soil because data for the volume of the greater than 5.6 mm material were not available. Mg/ha = mean Mg/ha per plot. Trtmt = treatment. Depth = Oea horizon or the 0-10 cm depth of mineral soil. se = + 1 standard error of the mean, calculated as: [standard deviation (sample) of the mean /square root of n]. n = number of samples. Soil pH Our method of pH determination was based on the method published in: Methods of Soil Analysis. Part 3: Chemical Methods. 1996. Published by Soil Science Society of America, Inc., and American Society of Agronomy, Inc. Madison, WI, USA. We modified that method as follows: 1) Soils were mixed with 0.01M CaCl2 instead of water. 2) We used a 2:1 liquid:soil ratio for mineral soils and a 4:1 ratio for organic soils. Measurements were made using air-dry soil. pH was measured on replicate soil cores at each depth in each plot for Bousson Forest 1996 soils and for Univ. of Wisconsin Arboretum 1997 soils. Only one sample per depth per plot was measured for pH for the Harvard Forest 1991 and 1995 soils. Where replicate samples were measured, the average pH of the replicates and the standard error are given. Avg = mean of replicate samples. se = + 1 standard error of the mean, calculated as: [standard deviation (sample) of the mean /square root of n]. n = number of samples. trt = treatment (if given). blk = block (if given). Root Mass Determination After the Oea, 0-10 cm mineral and 10-15 cm mineral soils were passed through a 5.6 mm sieve (see Methods for 1991 soil sampling), the roots were picked out and separated into three categories. Two of the categories were fine tree roots and woody tree roots. The third category for the Oea soils was 'tubers etc.'roots (mainly Mianthemum canadense). The third category for the 0-10 cm soils was 'herb' (herbaceous) roots, and for the 10-15 cm soils the third category was designated 'other' roots. Roots were rinsed in reverse-osmosis quality water and dried at 70 deg C and weighed. Data were initially expressed as g oven-dry roots per surface area of soil, for each of the depths sampled. Oea data were calculated using a surface area of 225 cm2, the area of the 15 cm x 15cm template. Mineral soil calculations used an area of 20.78 cm2, the area of a 2' diameter core. These values were then scaled up and expressed as kg oven-dry roots per hectare, which is the format of the data file posted here. Data given: Avg = mean root mass expressed as kg/ha per plot for each category and depth//horizon. se = + 1 standard error of the mean, calculated as: [standard deviation (sample) of the mean /square root of n]. n = number of samples. trt = treatment (if given). blk = block (if given). Soil Temperature Soil temperature is collected hourly at 5 cm and 15 cm depths in the mineral soil each plot with a Campbell Scientific data logger and temperature probes. Data collection began on June 9, 1994 (Day of Year 159), and was collected continuously through December 1997. Gaps in data exist for much of 1997, 1998, and 1999 due to datalogger malfunction. Therefore, soil temperature data are not given for 1997 and 1998. The continuous data record resumed in April 1999. In August , 1999, Campbell Scientific probes were removed from No Roots and No Inputs plots (exception: probes were left intact in plot 8, No Roots). An Onset Optic Stowaway datalogger was installed in each No Roots and No Inputs plot to record soil temperature at 10 cm depth. These data are given from August 8, 1999 through October 30, 2001. On November 21, three probes previously installed in plots 4 and 16 (TOX) were mounted on a tree near each of these two plots at breast height, shielded from direct sun, to record air temperatures. These air temperature data are listed in the last (right-hand most) columns in all yearly soil temperature data files beginning November 1999. On October 31, 2001, the rest of the plots received an Onset Optic Stowaway datalogger. Onset dataloggers in all 21 plots were positioned to record soil temperature at a depth of 12 cm. These data are included in the data files for November 2001 and after. NOTE: Frost heaving may partially eject probes from the soil and cause some probes to read air temperature. Probes are repositioned in early spring. Data Data presented are the average of hourly temperature readings for each day of the year. Hourly temperatures are also available in raw form. Data are given in deg C. Only data for functioning probes are given. Treatment: Block = block number. Plot = plot number. Depth = cm below mineral soil surface. Probe = denoted by plot number and depth: a = 5 cm, b = 15 cm, c = 12 or 15 cm as noted; air temp = probes recording air temperature at 1.4 m height above the ground. DOY = Day of year. YEAR. Soil temperature = expressed as deg C. Air temperature = expressed at deg C. nd = no data. Soil Respiration Soda Lime. In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, soil respiration was measured using the soda lime technique (Edwards et al. 1982, Raich et al. 1990). Carbon dioxide emitted from soil was absorbed in 60 g of 105 deg C-oven-dry soda lime contained in an open tin on the soil surface, underneath a white plastic bucket approximately 20 cm tall and 28 cm in diameter. The bucket's upper surface was covered with aluminum foil to minimize solar heating. Rocks (~5 kg) placed on top of each bucket held it firmly against the forest floor. Buckets were seated no more than 1 cm deep to avoid severing live roots. After 24 hours, the soda lime tins were removed, oven-dried (105 deg C), and reweighed. CO2 efflux was measured simultaneously in all 21 plots on each collection date. The same location within each plot was sampled on each date. The weight gain of the soda lime during the 24 hours of CO2 absorption was used to calculate the CO2 efflux from the soil surface. Soil respiration was measured approximately once a week from May-September, and every two weeks or once per month in the fall and spring. The period of time over which measurements were made varied from year to year. Measurements were not made when snow covered the ground. Soda lime results underestimated high fluxes and overestimated low fluxes as compared with IRGA data collected in 1994. All soda lime collected data (1991-1994) have been corrected to IRGA-based numbers, according to the relationship between IRGA- and soda lime-measured fluxes in 1994. Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA). In 1994, soil respiration data was collected with an IRGA (LI-COR model 6262) in addition to the soda lime measurements. The IRGA was fitted with a pump and chamber to create a closed-loop system. Measurements were made twice daily at the times of minimum and maximum flux (morning and afternoon). The two measurements were averaged to obtain daily soil CO2 flux. All soil respiration data from 1995 on were collected only with the IRGA. Description of data. Average daily fluxes for each plot, expressed as mg CO2-C/m2/day, for each collection date."

00047-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Soil Bulk Density For sample processing details, see the information for soil sampling in 1991. This file 'HF DIRT in 1991' is listed in the Data Catalog under Sampling Information – Soils. Data given are expressed as Mg of oven-dry (105 deg C) soil per hectare. Data could not be expressed as wt/volume of soil because data for the volume of the greater than 5.6 mm material were not available. Mg/ha = mean Mg/ha per plot. Trtmt = treatment. Depth = Oea horizon or the 0-10 cm depth of mineral soil. se = + 1 standard error of the mean, calculated as: [standard deviation (sample) of the mean /square root of n]. n = number of samples. Soil pH Our method of pH determination was based on the method published in: Methods of Soil Analysis. Part 3: Chemical Methods. 1996. Published by Soil Science Society of America, Inc., and American Society of Agronomy, Inc. Madison, WI, USA. We modified that method as follows: 1) Soils were mixed with 0.01M CaCl2 instead of water. 2) We used a 2:1 liquid:soil ratio for mineral soils and a 4:1 ratio for organic soils. Measurements were made using air-dry soil. pH was measured on replicate soil cores at each depth in each plot for Bousson Forest 1996 soils and for Univ. of Wisconsin Arboretum 1997 soils. Only one sample per depth per plot was measured for pH for the Harvard Forest 1991 and 1995 soils. Where replicate samples were measured, the average pH of the replicates and the standard error are given. Avg = mean of replicate samples. se = + 1 standard error of the mean, calculated as: [standard deviation (sample) of the mean /square root of n]. n = number of samples. trt = treatment (if given). blk = block (if given). Root Mass Determination After the Oea, 0-10 cm mineral and 10-15 cm mineral soils were passed through a 5.6 mm sieve (see Methods for 1991 soil sampling), the roots were picked out and separated into three categories. Two of the categories were fine tree roots and woody tree roots. The third category for the Oea soils was 'tubers etc.'roots (mainly Mianthemum canadense). The third category for the 0-10 cm soils was 'herb' (herbaceous) roots, and for the 10-15 cm soils the third category was designated 'other' roots. Roots were rinsed in reverse-osmosis quality water and dried at 70 deg C and weighed. Data were initially expressed as g oven-dry roots per surface area of soil, for each of the depths sampled. Oea data were calculated using a surface area of 225 cm2, the area of the 15 cm x 15cm template. Mineral soil calculations used an area of 20.78 cm2, the area of a 2' diameter core. These values were then scaled up and expressed as kg oven-dry roots per hectare, which is the format of the data file posted here. Data given: Avg = mean root mass expressed as kg/ha per plot for each category and depth//horizon. se = + 1 standard error of the mean, calculated as: [standard deviation (sample) of the mean /square root of n]. n = number of samples. trt = treatment (if given). blk = block (if given). Soil Temperature Soil temperature is collected hourly at 5 cm and 15 cm depths in the mineral soil each plot with a Campbell Scientific data logger and temperature probes. Data collection began on June 9, 1994 (Day of Year 159), and was collected continuously through December 1997. Gaps in data exist for much of 1997, 1998, and 1999 due to datalogger malfunction. Therefore, soil temperature data are not given for 1997 and 1998. The continuous data record resumed in April 1999. In August , 1999, Campbell Scientific probes were removed from No Roots and No Inputs plots (exception: probes were left intact in plot 8, No Roots). An Onset Optic Stowaway datalogger was installed in each No Roots and No Inputs plot to record soil temperature at 10 cm depth. These data are given from August 8, 1999 through October 30, 2001. On November 21, three probes previously installed in plots 4 and 16 (TOX) were mounted on a tree near each of these two plots at breast height, shielded from direct sun, to record air temperatures. These air temperature data are listed in the last (right-hand most) columns in all yearly soil temperature data files beginning November 1999. On October 31, 2001, the rest of the plots received an Onset Optic Stowaway datalogger. Onset dataloggers in all 21 plots were positioned to record soil temperature at a depth of 12 cm. These data are included in the data files for November 2001 and after. NOTE: Frost heaving may partially eject probes from the soil and cause some probes to read air temperature. Probes are repositioned in early spring. Data Data presented are the average of hourly temperature readings for each day of the year. Hourly temperatures are also available in raw form. Data are given in deg C. Only data for functioning probes are given. Treatment: Block = block number. Plot = plot number. Depth = cm below mineral soil surface. Probe = denoted by plot number and depth: a = 5 cm, b = 15 cm, c = 12 or 15 cm as noted; air temp = probes recording air temperature at 1.4 m height above the ground. DOY = Day of year. YEAR. Soil temperature = expressed as deg C. Air temperature = expressed at deg C. nd = no data. Soil Respiration Soda Lime. In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, soil respiration was measured using the soda lime technique (Edwards et al. 1982, Raich et al. 1990). Carbon dioxide emitted from soil was absorbed in 60 g of 105 deg C-oven-dry soda lime contained in an open tin on the soil surface, underneath a white plastic bucket approximately 20 cm tall and 28 cm in diameter. The bucket's upper surface was covered with aluminum foil to minimize solar heating. Rocks (~5 kg) placed on top of each bucket held it firmly against the forest floor. Buckets were seated no more than 1 cm deep to avoid severing live roots. After 24 hours, the soda lime tins were removed, oven-dried (105 deg C), and reweighed. CO2 efflux was measured simultaneously in all 21 plots on each collection date. The same location within each plot was sampled on each date. The weight gain of the soda lime during the 24 hours of CO2 absorption was used to calculate the CO2 efflux from the soil surface. Soil respiration was measured approximately once a week from May-September, and every two weeks or once per month in the fall and spring. The period of time over which measurements were made varied from year to year. Measurements were not made when snow covered the ground. Soda lime results underestimated high fluxes and overestimated low fluxes as compared with IRGA data collected in 1994. All soda lime collected data (1991-1994) have been corrected to IRGA-based numbers, according to the relationship between IRGA- and soda lime-measured fluxes in 1994. Infrared Gas Analyzer (IRGA). In 1994, soil respiration data was collected with an IRGA (LI-COR model 6262) in addition to the soda lime measurements. The IRGA was fitted with a pump and chamber to create a closed-loop system. Measurements were made twice daily at the times of minimum and maximum flux (morning and afternoon). The two measurements were averaged to obtain daily soil CO2 flux. All soil respiration data from 1995 on were collected only with the IRGA. Description of data. Average daily fluxes for each plot, expressed as mg CO2-C/m2/day, for each collection date."

00048-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) is an important, but often neglected, component of lake ecosystems. It is ecologically valuable because it creates littoral habitat complexity but it is susceptible to manipulation by riparian process, in particular removal by property owners. The objective of this study is to determine the spatial scales at which human and environmental factors contribute to coarse woody debris input and output dynamics. Coarse woody debris, boat docks, and riparian trees (with the potential of becoming CWD) around the five lakes of the NTL-LTER site (Trout Lake, Allequash Lake (north basin), Sparkling Lake, Crystal Lake, and Big Muskellunge Lake) were measured in 1996 and 1997. Boat docks were located on all 5 lakes. Docks were verified in 1997 using digital orthophotos. GPS positions were adjusted to coincide with the photos. Many of the docks were photographed with a digital camera."

After retrieving this data (usually every January), the parameters that are recorded are processed from level 0 (raw) to level 1 (processed, provided on the web). The raw data file descriptions and task lists summarize what was done to get from level 0 to level 1 for all station found at the following address: http://www.mcmlter.org/data/meteorology/tasks/task_lists.htm The last usable data was recorded on January 4, 2006 @ 14:00. There was some intermittent data recorded during the 2006-2007 season, but not much. The station was modified in late January 2007 to support another experiment Citations Doran, Peter T., Gayle L.

The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds, except the sonic range which samples every 15 minutes, and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 15 minutes. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval. The Lake Bonney Snowfence station is located at a latitude of -77.7248, a longitude of 162.3132, and an elevation of 109.1 meters above sea level.

00050-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"1999"
00050-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The tower-based CO2 measurements and key meteorological drivers are intended to examine how regional and ecosystem level processes in a mid-latitude forest contribute to global carbon cycling. Specifically, we endeavor to understand quantitatively how and why forested ecosystems take up or release carbon, on time scales from hours to decades, and to elucidate responses to climate changes and management interventions. The tower was installed 1989 and the resulting eddy-flux measurements constitute the longest running record of the net-ecosystem carbon exchange in a North American Forest. The resulting long-term record of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) has shown the effects of climate anomalies on carbon fluxes for seasonal and annual time scales. For example, reduced soil frost allows greater respiration in the winter leading to lower C sequestration. Cumulative gross photosynthesis depends on when the canopy emerges in the spring. Warmer springtime temperatures lead to greater uptake of C. As the NEE record is extended and augmented by supporting ecological measurements, we can further identify longer-term effects of climate perturbations on carbon fluxes and further define the relationship between stand history and carbon sequestration. Climatic anomalies in one season or year may have a longer-term effect on the sequestration of carbon in subsequent seasons or years. The flux and ecological measurements are coordinated with studies at other sites through the AmeriFlux network. By examining the relationships between carbon fluxes and the driving physical and biological variables across a range of sites we are enhancing understanding of the processes that control NEE."

Wind speed and direction and momentum and sensible heat fluxes are computed from the anemometer data. Fast-response CO2-H2O are determined by closed-path IR-Absorbance analyzer. Vertical fluxes are computed on 30-min intervals. Concentration profiles of CO2 are determined by closed-path IR absorbance analyzer sampling from inlets at 30,24,18,12,6, 3,1,0.05m. Calibrated using a pair of absolute standards that bracket the range of ambient concentration. Air temperatures are measured using 30kW thermistors and relative humidity is measured using thin-film capacitor sensors mounted in aspirated radiation shields at 30,22,12,6,3m. Soil temperatures at the litter-soil interface and 20cm 50cm depth are measured with 30kW thermistors. Photosynthetically active photon flux density is determined by Quantum sensors at 29 and 12m. Net radiation is measured using a net radiation sensor."

Wind speed and direction and momentum and sensible heat fluxes are computed from the anemometer data. Fast-response CO2-H2O are determined by closed-path IR-Absorbance analyzer. Vertical fluxes are computed on 30-min intervals. Concentration profiles of CO2 are determined by closed-path IR absorbance analyzer sampling from inlets at 30,24,18,12,6, 3,1,0.05m. Calibrated using a pair of absolute standards that bracket the range of ambient concentration. Air temperatures are measured using 30kW thermistors and relative humidity is measured using thin-film capacitor sensors mounted in aspirated radiation shields at 30,22,12,6,3m. Soil temperatures at the litter-soil interface and 20cm 50cm depth are measured with 30kW thermistors. Photosynthetically active photon flux density is determined by Quantum sensors at 29 and 12m. Net radiation is measured using a net radiation sensor."

Centers of 8 polygons were found and labelled 'A' to 'H'. Samples were taken from within a 10 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. A hole approximately 20 cm deep was dug at the center of each polygon. Samples were taken at depths 0-2.5 cm, 2.5-5 cm, 5-10 cm and 10-20 cm by digging in from the sides. Very large rocks (>20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag. The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +5 degrees C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. Approximately 200cm3 of soil was placed in a pre-weighed 800mL plastic beaker. Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter were removed from the sample. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum dish, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil and to express data as numbers of soil organisms per unit dry weight of soil."

The file format was suggested by the LTER data manager, to conform with the relational database structure. On 19 Oct 1998, the file was submitted to Denise Steigerwald, the MCM LTER data manager, located at INSTAAR, University of Colorado. Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager combined the 3 data files, removed columns for latitude and longitude, and updated the location names to match those provided in the 'soil measurement locations' file (from which latitude and longitude can be found). In addition, a column for depth range was added in order to make it possible to compare soil moisture, chlorophyll-a, and soil nematode densities found at a given depth, but stored in different data files (dpca94, dpah94, dpso9394, and dpwo9394 files). The resulting file was reformatted to present in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above. On 28-Oct-1998, Andy Parsons discovered an error in the documentation of the storage temperature used for the soil samples collected. He informed the data manager of this error, resulting in an update from -8C to +5C in the methods portion of the page above."

00052-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Each core sample was extruded and immediately fixed in 10 percent borax-buffered formalin with Rose Bengal. Salinity was measured by refractometer and Eh (September 1972 - December 1976) by platinum electrode. Oxidizable organic matter was determined using the wet dichromate method (Walkley and Black 1934). Granulometric parameters were measured by wet sieving through phi series sieves to 63 micrometers, and drying and weighing the sediment retained on the sieves. An aliquot of the material passing the 63 micrometer sieve was removed for pipette analysis (Folk 1968). Sorting coefficient was calculated using methods by Trask (1932). Mud samples were extracted using Ludox centrifugation (de Jonge and Bowmann 1977); the sand samples by the shaking-supernatant technique of Wieser (1960). All animals retained on a 63 micrometer sieve were enumerated to major taxon; every copepod and every 4th nematode was removed for species identification. Since all sorted samples were formalin fixed, soft-bodied taxa abundance (e.g. gastrotrichs, turbellarians, ciliates) was probably underestimated (Hulings and Gray 1971). Ciliates may have been further underestimated since the samples were collected on a 63 micrometer sieve; thus only the larger ciliates (e.g. Tracheloraphis spp.) were retained.Experimental DesignThe study sites (1 sand, 1 mud) in North Inlet, South Carolina, USA, were sampled monthly from January 1973 through December 1980 and every two weeks from January 1981 - December 1983. At each site 4 replicate core samples were taken up to March 1976, 3 replicates from April 1976 - December 1980 and 2 replicates from January 1981 December 1983. All cores were taken to the depth of the redox potential discontinuity (RPD); typically 1 to 2 centimeters in mud; 4 to 10 centimeters in sand. Both sites are subtidal, located 1 meter below MLW. Sediment samples were collected for organic analysis up to 1978, and for sediment size analysis monthly or quarterly (up to September 1979) and then monthly (March - December 1983). Four data sets were collected to assess potential temperature effects: (1) surface-sediment temperature measurements taken at the time of meiofauna sample collection (January 1973 - December 1983); (2) minimum and maximum daily air temperature recorded at the Georgetown County, SC, Airport from January 1935 - December 1978 (44 yr); (3) daily surface water temperatures from the mouth of the North Inlet estuary, June 1979 - December 1983; (4) heating and cooling degree days data collected at the Charleston Airport, Charleston, SC, December 1968 - April 1984."

00052-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes and wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek. The study site is the North Inlet marsh, a 3000 hectare high salinity estuary dominated by Spartina alterniflora, located approximately 6 km east of Georgetown, South Carolina. The marsh is bordered on the east by two barrier islands; on the south by a larger brackish estuary, Winyah Bay; and on the west and north by a mixed oak-pine forested peninsula. Debidue Site (DD) - Debidue is a sand-bottomed site located approximately .5 km inside the Inlet mouth adjacent to the confluence of two major marsh creeks, Debidue and Town Creeks. The site is at the lower end of an extensive sand bar and is subject to strong current and wave action. Bread and Butter Site (BB) - This site is located on a muddy subtidal bank of Bread and Butter Creek, about 100 m inside the mouth of this medium sized creek. The creek is 1.5 km SW of the Debidue site in the center of the marsh. The creek is 10 m wide at low tide at the sample site and is sheltered from strong current and wave action. The creek is lined with mud banks and oyster bars and the sediment at the sampling site is fine, silty mud.-79.2936-79.104233.35733.2125"

00053-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Soil samples were collected from three sites: 30 samples from the south side of Lake Hoare sampled in a 6m2 area; 30 samples from the south side of Lake Fryxell sampled in a 6m2 area; and 27 samples in the Site of Special Scientific Interest #12 collected along three 100-m transects extending away from glacier meltwater. Samples were taken for chlorophyll a analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one plastic vial and clean plastic teaspoon per sample. Samples were taken from within the 10 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. Soil was collected to 1 cm depth with the plastic spoon, excluding rocks with a diameter >5 mm. About 4 teaspoons of soil were placed into the vial, keeping the vial out of the light in a closed hand. The soil samples were stored in a light-tight bag, in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +5C until further processing. Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil. All procedures were carried out in the dark or very low irradiance to avoid degradation of the chlorophyll. The soil samples were mixed thoroughly in the vials, and a sample of approximately 5 g was weighed out in to a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a screw-top cap. 10 mL of a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution was added to each sample and they were mixed thoroughly on a bench-top Vortex mixer for about 5 seconds. The vials were placed in a -4C constant temperature room, in the dark, and left for 12-18 hours. Determination of chlorophyll a concentration. This was determined fluorometrically using a Turner model 111 fluorometer. A calibration using a known concentration of chlorophyll was carried out prior to sample analysis. The machine was blanked using a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution. Each vial was mixed thoroughly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 1800 RPM. A sample of approximately 4 mL of the DMSO/acetone solution was taken from the top of the sample with a pipette, being careful not to get any soil particles in the solution. The sample was placed in a cuvette, in to the fluorometer and the fluorescence was recorded . This was done fairly quickly in order to prevent light from breaking down the chlorophyll. This measurement is called Fo, the initial fluorescence. After taking this reading, 0.1 mL of 1N HCl was added directly to the cuvette and the cuvette was gently agitated. After 20 seconds, the fluorescence was re-measured. (During this step, the acid converts the chlorophyll to phaeophytin by releasing a magnesium ion in an acidic environment). This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after acidification. The solution was discarded in to a waste container, and the cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90% acetone solution before proceeding with the next sample. Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil.

This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after acidification. The solution was discarded in to a waste container, and the cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90% acetone solution before proceeding with the next sample. Calculation of chlorophyll concentration. The calibration curve that was constructed for the fluorometer had the following equation: [chlorophyll (ug/L) = (Fo-Fa)-0.4254)/2.2385]. The Fo and Fa figures were put in to this equation to calculate chlorophyll concentration. Subsequently, this figure was divided by 1000 to convert to ug/mL. Next, this is multiplied by 10 as the soil was extracted in 10mL of DMSO/90% acetone. Finally, this is divided by the fresh weight of the soil in g to give the concentration in ug chlorophyll per g fresh weight of soil. If the extract was diluted prior to reading on the fluorometer, the dilution factor (noted in the comments column) was applied at the end of the equation."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park. There are a total of 21 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle.-81.07794623-80.4897820725.7614517124.912934922000-05-012006-04-30"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

00059-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"I. Field Protocol Paired simultaneous zooplankton collections were made at each of two LTER sampling sites (BB and DD) in Town Creek every two weeks. Samples were taken 2-3 hours prior to a midday low tide. From Cruises 1 - 9 ( 1/20/81 - 5/15/81 ). Two plankton nets were towed from the stern of a small outboard boat simultaneously. The nets were deployed by two persons who released the nets from the moving boat while keeping tension on the tow ropes. Weights attached to the bridle chuck allowed the net to settle near the bottom before the forward motion of the boat moved the net forward. From that point the tow was 90 seconds in duration increasing boat speed at 30 second intervals, allowing an oblique pattern from bottom to surface. Due to continual difficulty with this method, beginning with cruise 10 ( 6/1/81 ), an alternate method of zooplankton collection was implemented. On station, a small outboard boat was anchored (bow into the ebb current) and two weighted closed 30 cm diameter plankton nets were lowered to the creek bottom via a metered nylon rope, and a messenger released to open the nets for fishing. An oblique collection of the water column was made, sampling the bottom, mid, and surface levels for prescribed time intervals (never more than 2 minutes at each level). The amount of water filtered was registered by a torpedo-shaped General Oceanics flow meter Model 2040 mounted in the mouth of each net. Readings were taken before and after each tow. To insure an optimal amount of water filtered (~4 cubic meters) a minimum of ~2000 flow meter revolutions was required before sample retrieval. In the event this minimum was not obtained, the nets were lowered back into the water and an adequate amount of water was filtered. Upon sample retrieval, the contents of the net were concentrated into a windowed cod end jar, poured into a 1 liter pre-labeled Nalgene jar, and preserved with 30 ml of 100 percent formalin, buffered and stained with Rose Bengal. Sample replicates were returned to the lab for analysis. Gear Description: Cruises 1 - 9 (1/20/81 - 5/15/81) Each zooplankton net had a 30 cm diameter mouth and a 102 cm cylindrical body followed by a 74 cm conical section which tapered to a 10 cm cod end mouth. The mesh size of the entire net was 153 micron Nytex. A bridle attached the 30 cm diameter stainless steel round mouth frame to a tow rope. The cod end was a PVC cylinder with a Nytex (153 micron) window. A General Oceanics flow meter Model 2040 was mounted just inside the net mouth, slightly off-center. Cruises 10 - 275 (6/1/81 - 10/31/92) The zooplankton collection apparatus consists of a 153 micron mesh Nytex plankton net (described above) mounted to an opening assembly. The opening apparatus consists of a series of three 45 cm long, 1' diameter, hollow, stainless steel bars. Installed near the ends of each bar were copper sleeves mounted perpendicular to the pipe length. Braided nylon line (1/4') ran through the sleeves and the apparatus was assembled such that the upper and lower bars were fixed with the middle bar sliding up and down along the nylon line. The net was mounted to the upper and middle bars allowing the net mouth to be closed, prior to deployment. A trip mechanism on the tow line was triggered by a messenger and the net opened. Each net was weighted with a 1/4 m long, 10 lb. stainless steel weight. At greatest depths, the net fished 1/2 m from the creek bottom. This distance prevented the nets from filling with large amounts of sand and fecal material. II. Lab Analysis Prior to counting, the entire sample was sieved, rinsed in fresh water and the formalin disposed of. The sample was then rinsed into a graduatedbeaker and volume brought to 200 ml. A 2 ml stempel pipet sub-sample was removed and placed in a gridded counting tray. All organisms greater than or equal to 153 micron were identified to appropriate taxon and/or life stage and enumerated using a Wild binocular microscope at 24X. Beginning with Cruise 81 ( 4/12/84 ), samples were counted using a Leitz Diavert inverted microscope at 16X. Adult copepods were identified to species and non-adult copepods to species/genus and developmental stage (naupliar or copepodid). Adult and developmental stages of other plankters were identified to phylum, class, or family (see zooplankton data sheet on file). Data were recorded as numbers/sub-sample to be later converted to numbers/cubic meter. Upon computation of the 2 ml sub-sample count, the entire sample was sieved through 1.0 mm mesh, rinsed and the 'larger' organisms identified and enumerated. The sample was recombined, stored in a labeled .25 l flint jar, preserved in a buffered 10 percent formalin solution stained with Rose Bengal. Samples were stored by cruise/date and station. III. Counts Raw counts of the 2ml sub-sample and the 1.0 mm sieved portion were recorded for all organisms encountered. Total numbers in the entire sample were calculated using Equation 1. The volume of water filtered was calculated with Equation 2. Concentrations of the taxa were then calculated using Equation 3. Data sheets were stored by cruise/date awaiting computer entry. Data were entered as concentrations (density; #/m3) based on the 2 ml sub-sample. Equation 1: Raw Count Na = 2 ml sub-sample count of organism a MF = Multiplication factor Na X MF = Ta (100 for LTER zpk) Ta = Total number of organism a Equation 2: Water Volume filtered r/t = revolutions per tow (r/t)/(r/m) x A(m2) = V(m3) r/m = flow meter calibration (revolutions per meter) A(m2) = Area of net V(m3) = volume of water filtered Equation 3: Concentration (density) Ta/V(m3) = #/m3Experimental DesignBecause previous field studies indicated that stage of tide and time of day affected organism abundance at the zooplankton stations, it was necessary to sample about every 14 days, keeping these variables 'constant'. Thus paired, simultaneous zooplankton tows were made, fishing the mid ebb tidal current, at the same sites, when the end of the ebbing tide occurred near noon. Replicated biweekly measurements were used to identify seasonal patterns of abundance for each taxon. Comparisons of abundance between years provided information on long term trends. Collection at a sandy, turbulent inlet and a major marsh creek location allowed for a comparison of two habitat types."

The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek. The North Inlet LTER site is located on the eastern shore of the Atlantic Ocean, in a small tidal estuary near Georgetown, South Carolina, U.S.A. Coordinates for the North Inlet estuary are latitude 79 degrees 10 minutes and longitude 33 degrees 11 minutes. Zooplankton collections were made at two locations in Town Creek, the major tidal creek in the North Inlet estuary. The DD site is located near the inlet mouth 10 m off the southern shore of Town Creek at a small drainage very near the former site of the Town Creek platform. The boat was anchored, bow into the ebbing tidal current, and the paired weighted zooplankton nets lowered to the bottom. Tows were taken shortly after mid-ebb (2-hours prior to low tide) when tidal velocities were swiftest, often exceeding 0.5 m/sec-1. Water depth averaged 4 m. The BB site is located approximately 2 km inshore from the inlet in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth of Boze's Creek. Tows, taken at mid-ebb, were fished at tidal velocities less than or equal to 0.5 m/sec-1. Water depth averaged 4 m. The BB collection site is located in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth of Boze's Creek. Town Creek is the main tidal creek in the North Inlet estuary and is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes. The creek banks are covered by large clusters of the American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), shell rubble, and intermittent muddy flats. The BB zooplankton station average water depth at mid ebb is approximately 4 m. Tidal velocity averages 0.3 m/sec-1. Water clarity varies with water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity, duration, and rainfall. The creek bottom at this site is muddy clay covered by varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal matter. The DD collection site is characterized by a high energy, sandy or heavily scoured bottom habitat. Mid ebb water velocities can exceed 1.0 m/sec-1, re-suspending large amounts of sand and debris. Water clarity varies with water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity, duration, and rainfall. At both sites, Town Creek is a well-mixed, high salinity creek inundated by diurnal tides. Rain input, primarily runoff, depresses salinities briefly depending on the duration and frequency. Water temperatures mirror local air conditions; semi--temperate/tropical-79.2936-79.104233.35733.2125"

00060-metadata.xml,Maintenance,/eml:eml/dataset/maintenance,"On September 6, 1999, the data manager added the 1998-1999 data to this dataset. In the process,she did some fine-tuning of the data, which included: 1. Addition of PAR values between Nov 24, 1997 @ 11:30 and Jan 13, 1998 @ 12:00. Thiswas done at the request of Thomas Nylen. On June 1, 2000, the 1999-2000 data was posted. In the process, Denise Steigerwald changed thelayout of the files so that they were sorted by category (air temperatures, humidity, radiation,wind etc.) rather than by year. Files containing monthly and daily averages were generated andminor adjustments were made to the metadata. On June 1, 2000, relative humidity (RH) values were corrected for a systematic error in the measurement created by an instrument manufacturer error. All RH data with air temperatures below freezing were corrected using the vapor pressure over ice (rather than over water whichwas used initially). The error became quite large for very cold temperatures (the correction couldgrow to around 30%). The formula used for the correction was: RH_corr=RH_orig/((A*temp*temp)+(B*temp)+C) where RH_corr = corrected relative humidity RH_orig = original relative humidity temp = air temperature A = 4.165E-5 B = 9.7E-3 C = 1.0 For example, with an air temperature of -2.3 and RH_orig of 50.6, the RH_corr will be 51.7.Records that showed corrected RH values greater than or equal to 100 were changed to 99.99and flagged. In June 2000, summary files were added to the web containing daily and monthly statistics.These were generated by creating 'views' of daily and monthly means, minimums, maximumsand counts of the records represented in the Oracle database's meteorology tables. In 2007, it was realized that the RH error was still present in parts of the dataset. Hasan Basagic made the above corrections to the VIAM dataset for the date range 1/26/2004 11:00 - 12/16/2006 10:00 (100,850 records). In September, 2007 the information manager (Chris Gardner) removed all old RH data and re-inserted then newly calculated values and associated comments. The original files are archive in the 'submitted data' section of the mcmlter server."

00064-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The experimental design was a randomized block, with 5 replicates per treatment. Within each block were 3 plots measuring approximately 1m x 1m, with a central circular area of 85 cm diameter (approx. 0.57 m2) used for treatments and sampling. The treatments were as follows: (C) control plots (no manipulations), (W) nanopure water added to field capacity to 10 cm depth (5.6 L/plot), (WS) sucrose added in solution (15.82 g sucrose in 5.6 L water per plot). Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 85 cm diameter circular area of each plot starting at the 12:00 position on the first day. The above treatments were then applied to the plots. The 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions were then sampled for each successive date. The location of the sampling was recorded each time so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to a 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (>20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at 5 degrees C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. Approximately 200 cm3 of soil was placed in a pre-weighed 800mL plastic beaker. Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter were removed from the sample. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum dish, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil and to express data as numbers of soil organisms per unit dry weight of soil. The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed. Cold tap water was added up to 650 mL. The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or figure of 8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula. Immediately the liquid was poured into wet screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh. The screens were rinsed gently with ice cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the stack, keeping the screens at an angle as the water filtered through. The water was kept on ice at all times. The top screen was removed, and the lower screen rinsed top down, never directly on top of the soil, but at the top of the screen and from behind. The water was allowed to cascade down and carry the particles into the bottom wedge of the angled screen. The side of the screen was tapped gently to filter all the water through. The suspension was rinsed from the front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to overflow the edge of the screen. The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and rinsing the funnel gently. The suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 1744 RPM. The liquid was decanted, leaving a few mL on top of the soil particles. The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g sucrose per liter of tap water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL. This was stirred gently with a spatula until the pellet was broken up and suspended. The suspension was centrifuged for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube. Samples were refrigerated at 5 degrees C until counted. Samples were washed into a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x10 or x20 magnification. Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted. Nematodes were identified to species and sex, and counted. Total numbers in each sample were recorded on data sheets. All species of nematode, and all rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample were recorded. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors."

00064-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The experimental design was a randomized block, with 5 replicates per treatment. Within each block were 3 plots measuring approximately 1m x 1m, with a central circular area of 85 cm diameter (approx. 0.57 m2) used for treatments and sampling. The treatments were as follows: (C) control plots (no manipulations), (W) nanopure water added to field capacity to 10 cm depth (5.6 L/plot), (WS) sucrose added in solution (15.82 g sucrose in 5.6 L water per plot). Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 85 cm diameter circular area of each plot starting at the 12:00 position on the first day. The above treatments were then applied to the plots. The 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions were then sampled for each successive date. The location of the sampling was recorded each time so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to a 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (>20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at 5 degrees C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening.

These tables contain data pertaining to continuous monitored water quality and quantity parameters measured with automatic recording devices on streams in this region. Specifically, these data correspond to the Von Guerard Stream. The Von Guerard Stream gage was removed on 20 Dec 2012 due to lake level rise, a new gage upstream has been in use since 2012-2013 season, from -77.608269, 163.253853 to -77.609210,163.254203"

00067-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations and datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database."

00067-metadata.xml,Maintenance,/eml:eml/dataset/maintenance,"The 'discrete_stream_gauge' table was created by Harry House in early 1994. It was first stored in an INGRES database, but was converted to ORACLE format in early 1996. Modifications were generally made each year after the initial creation in the early part of the year. It was transferred to INSTAAR in late 1997, where it was stored in a Microsoft Access database, and presented on the web in ascii, comma delimited files. In October, 1999 Mike Gooseff submitted the 1997-98 data to Denise Steigerwald (the data manager) in ascii, comma delimited files. In order to prepare the files for use in an Oracle database as well as a geographic information system, Denise created a field for 'strmgageid' (stream gage id), converted any time fields of 24:00 to 0:00 on the following day, combined the date and time fields into one date/time field, and separated the data into separate files for each station. Data which was previously presented according to decade collected is now presented according to location, and contains records from the start date of monitoring for a given stream gage. The resulting files are available through the links provided above. In order to make the data more relational / useful in Oracle and ArcInfo, and generate links between different data and metadata fields, a dataset code was added to these files. The Von Guerard Stream gage was removed on 20 Dec 2012 due to lake level rise, a new gage upstream has been in use since 2012-2013 season. New codes for the COMMENTS column were created in 2005 after a meeting between the stream team and the information manager (Chris Gardner). These comments were added to stream data that were worked up after that point - they usually appear in the data around the 2003 season."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

00070-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The Canada glacier was sampled for cryoconite holes over a period of three days by Thomas Nylen, Robin Johnston and Dorota Porazinska. Samples 1-12 were collected in the evening of 16 January 2001, samples 13-38 throughout the entire day of 17 January 2001, and the remaining samples throughout the entire day of 18 January 2001.Samples were taken from seven different locations on the Canada Glacier. GPS coordinates of these sites and the number of samples taken at each site is the following: * Met Station: S 77deg 36.7' and E 162deg 57.7', Number of samples = 12 * Upper West: S 77deg 36.5' and E 162deg 56.4', Number of samples = 3 * Upper East: ?, Number of samples = 7 * Middle East: S 77deg 36.8' and E 163deg 10.1', Number of samples = 7 * Lower East: S 77deg 37.4' and ?, Number of samples = 7 * Lower Central: Stake #65 (need to get from Thomas), Number of samples = 6 * Lower West: S 77deg 37' 17' and E 162deg 55' 56', Number of samples = 7 * Middle West: S 77deg 37' 11.4' and E 162deg 56' 08.6', Number of samples = 6 At each location, cryoholes adjacent to each other were sampled. All cryoholes (except one) were frozen solid. To reach the sediment layer, a Sipre ice corer was used. As soon as a cryohole was located, the diameter in N-S and E-W directions was recorded, and followed by drilling into the ice until the sediments would show up in the drilling dust accumulating on the ice surface. All drilling was done by Thomas Nylen. When the ice core was excavated, the depth of the cryohole (from the ice surface to bottom of the sediment layer), and the width of the sediment layer were measured. Only 25 cm (from the bottom of the sediment up) of the ice core were packed into sterile Whirl-Pak large plastic bags, stored in a back pack and brought down to the Lake Hoare camp lab. The Sipre ice corer and other heavy supplies were pulled on sleds. All ice cores were left in the lab at room temperature conditions to melt. Since plastic bags can be perforated by the sharpness of ice cores, bags containing ice cores were placed in plastic beakers to prevent leakage. Ice cores melted within 16 hours. When melted, samples were shaken to mix the sediment and water and left for at least 5 hours for the sediment to settle. 300 ml of supernatant were transferred into 500 ml Nalgene bottles (washed in soap water and rinsed three times with DI water). 100 ml of this volume were filtered on a column tower using 47mm 0.4micro PC membrane filters and collected into 100ml Nalgene bottles (washed as above) and used for cation and anion concentrations. Additional 100ml was filtered through baked 47mm Whatman GF/F filters and collected into 100ml amber glass bottles (washed as above, and baked at 470degC capped with aluminum foil, then closed with original caps that were rinsed in 10% HCL and DI water) for DOC. To kill all possible organisms in the water samples and thus prevent usage of DOC, samples were fixed with 1 ml of 37% HCL ( added to the bottles right after filtration). Filtration was done by Dorota Porazinska. The remaining water with sediment was transferred from the Whirl-Pak bags into 500ml Nalgene bottles. All samples were packed into coolers and transported back to McMurdo lab on 20 January 2001 where they were processed for pH, EC, and nematodes using standard protocols. [DP 20 Jan 01]."

00071-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations and datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database. Aquarius replaced ADAPS as system to to the stream flow workups."

00071-metadata.xml,Maintenance,/eml:eml/dataset/maintenance,"The 'discrete_stream_gauge' table was created by Harry House in early 1994. It was first stored in an INGRES database, but was converted to ORACLE format in early 1996. Modifications were generally made each year after the initial creation in the early part of the year. It was transferred to INSTAAR in late 1997, where it was stored in a Microsoft Access database, and presented on the web in ascii, comma delimited files. In October, 1999 Mike Gooseff submitted the 1997-98 data to Denise Steigerwald (the data manager) in ascii, comma delimited files. In order to prepare the files for use in an Oracle database as well as a geographic information system, Denise created a field for 'strmgageid' (stream gage id), converted any time fields of 24:00 to 0:00 on the following day, combined the date and time fields into one date/time field, and separated the data into separate files for each station. Data which was previously presented according to decade collected is now presented according to location, and contains records from the start date of monitoring for a given stream gage. The resulting files are available through the links provided above. In order to make the data more relational / useful in Oracle and ArcInfo, and generate links between different data and metadata fields, a dataset code was added to these files. The field notes indicate a mix of instrument failure and low flow for the beggining of the 2002 season. No useful data was recorded for that period of time. Field Notes for the House Stream available at http://mcmlter.org/queries/streams/field_note_results.jsp?begDate=07%2F19%2F1993&endDate=08%2F20%2F2020&hydroStation=house_h2&begNum=0&endNum=50 Gage was removed 30 Jan 2012 due to lake level rise. Measurements stop on the 12/13 season. Inigo San Gil enhanced the metadata in 2014. (better titles, methods structure, consistency on attributes, typos, etc) New codes for the COMMENTS column were created in 2005 after a meeting between the stream team and the information manager (Chris Gardner). These comments were added to stream data that were worked up after that point - they usually appear in the data around the 2003 season."

No metadata was provided with this dataset; the UVM Spatial Analysis Lab has attempted to evaluate this dataset and generate metadata. There are no attributes associated with this dataset. This is part of a collection of 221 Baltimore Ecosystem Study metadata records that point to a geodatabase. The geodatabase is available online and is considerably large. Upon request, and under certain arrangements, it can be shipped on media, such as a usb hard drive. The geodatabase is roughly 51.4 Gb in size, consisting of 4,914 files in 160 folders. Although this metadata record and the others like it are not rich with attributes, it is nonetheless made available because the data that it represents could be indeed useful."

Glass slides were used as artificial substrates for periphyton growth. Twenty slides were incubated for 2 months in triplicate periphytometers (flow-through plastic boxes) at the surface (SRS sites) and bottom (FB) at each site. Data are presented in terms of grams dry and ash-free dry mass per area per time. This is part of continuous data collection to test the hypothesis that phosphorus and nitrogen limit productivity at the upstream and downstream ends, respectively, of the FCE transects. Conclusions await longer-term data collection."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

The filters that were used in the filtering process were first weighed, burned off and cleaned, then they were weighed with the particulates dried onto them. These filters were then cooked again for 24 hours at 450 degrees and weighed again. This was done to determine the inorganic particulates that were left. These values were recorded into a master sediment notebook, and stored on a SUN workstation by the Data Management Department at the lab.Experimental DesignWater samples were taken daily at three stations in the North Inlet Estuary System at 10:00 AM EST, 365 days a year."

North Inlet-Winyah Bay features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet, contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural, municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide another system for study within the Reserve. The Debidue site is located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue Creek. The Bread and Butter site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of Clambank Creek. Water column samples were collected approximately 0.5 meters below the water surface at three sites. 1. Town Creek water samples -- 33.19'38' Lat., 79.10'0' Long. 2.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

00079-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"As the mean annual temperature of northeast North America rises as a component of global climatic change, it is important to understand how the predominant vegetation of the region will be affected. Existing experimental and correlative evidence from field sites suggests that temperature rise will significantly modify soil processes, nutrient availability, and plant growth. We investigated the responses of temperate deciduous forest vegetation to artificial soil warming at 20 sampling dates during the 1992 and 1993 growing season. We explored whether soil warming measurably altered growth and the temporal dynamics of leaf and fruit production in 26 species of three contrasting plant growth forms (herbaceous perennials, shrubs, and canopy trees). We hypothesized that soil warming would exert differential effects on emergence, phenology, leaf expansion rates, growth, photosynthesis, and vegetative and sexual reproduction among species, with implications for changing community structure in these forests. Timing of leaf emergence and flower production was not affected by treatment in saplings; however, mature trees and shrubs leafed out slightly earlier and in larger numbers in heated plots. Soil warming significantly enhanced relative growth in stem diameters of woody plants, especially shrubs, in 1992. This effect was less pronounced in 1993. Species richness was lower in heated plots than in intact control plots in both years; disturbed but unheated control plots showed the lowest species richness of all plots. Changes in relative abundance of herbaceous species from 1992 to 1993 were not significantly affected by treatment. Rank abundances of species were more stable between years in the heated and disturbance-control plots than in the intact plots. Total density of herbaceous species was highest in heated plots during April and May of both years, reflecting greatly accelerated emergence of two dominant species, Maianthemum canadense and Uvularia sessilifolia, due to heating. Stem densities declined later in the season, however, and were lower in the heated plots than in the intact control plots. Photosynthetic rates of the two dominant herbaceous species were not affected by soil warming. Of all life forms, herbaceous species (spring ephemerals) were most sensitive to soil warming. Their early appearance could influence carbon and nitrogen acquisition by later-emerging woody species in these deciduous forests. Early leaf-out in woody shrubs and trees can also influence season-long dynamics of water use and carbon sequestration in forests. Soil warming may select for certain tolerant species and reduce species richness in temperate deciduous forests."

00079-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Growth and phenology of woody vegetation Beginning in April 1992, the spring following initiation of soil warming, all woody individuals between 5 mm and 35 mm basal diameter were identified to species (Table 1) and labelled with numbered plastic tags wrapped around the main stem. A subset of larger trees was also monitored (n=12 in heated and control plots; n=15 in disturbance-control plots). Total sample sizes were 109 woody individuals in control and heated plots, and 115 in disturbance-control plots. In April and September of 1992 and 1993, diameter (± 0.1 mm) was measured at two orthogonal locations at the base of the main stem of each plant, as an index of growth over the season. To obtain mean relative diameter increments from April to September 1992 and 1993, the orthogonal diameter measures at each sampling date were first averaged. Relative increments were then calculated for each year separately as ((AvgDiamSept - AvgDiamApr)/AvgDiamApr). Resulting values were arcsin-square root transformed to equalize variances, and investigated with ANOVA using soil treatment as a fixed factor in a randomized block design. At 8 spring-summer sampling dates in 1992 and 13 sampling dates in 1993, the phenological status of each of the marked woody individuals was noted. Individuals were inspected for evidence of leaves and reproductive structures, and placed into 1 of 8 phenological states occurring roughly in chronological order: 1) leaf buds closed; 2) buds opening; 3) new leaves expanding; 4) fully expanded leaves with emerging new leaf pair; 5) reproductive (flowers or fruits present); 6) more than 50 % of leaves changing color; 7) more than 50 % of leaves brown or abscised; 8) all leaves dropped. For statistical analyses, data on the phenology of reproduction and leaf production were considered separately. Percentages of all woody individuals reproducing per quadrat were calculated for each year, in three growth classes: trees (greater than 25 cm basal diameter), saplings ( 25 cm basal diameter), and shrub species. Six values of percent reproductives per treatment per growth class per year were obtained. Individuals on which folivory occurred were recorded. Mortality of labelled individuals was noted. In order to quantify average area per leaf and leaf expansion rates throughout the 1992 season, we measured the length of the midrib of at least six randomly chosen leaves per plant, in shrubs and saplings in each plot. Leaf area was calculated subsequently from non-destructive leaf length measures, from quadratic regressions of leaf area on leaf length obtained for a sample of 60 randomly collected leaves from each species (r2 between 0.925 and 0.977). Community structure, physiology and population dynamics of herbaceous species In each 5 x 5 m plot, a 1 x 1 m subplot was randomly designated for monitoring herbaceous flora (less than 5 mm basal diameter) and tree seedlings (species appear in Table 1). Each subplot was observed from 1992-1993. At all sampling dates, all ramets of each species present in the subplot were counted to determine stem density (per m2). Species richness, diversity and evenness values per plot were derived from these censuses. Diversity was calculated as the Shannon-Weiner index H = - piln(pi) where pi is the proportion of the ith species in each subplot. Evenness was scored as J = H /ln(S) where S = species richness in each subplot (scale of 0 to 1 where 0 indicates disproportionate dominance of a few taxa). As an index of vegetative propagation activity and ramet mortality, relative changes in ramet density from 5 June 1992 to 17 May 1993 (dates of density maxima) were computed as ((Density1993 - Density1993)/(Density1992)). The percentage of individuals in vegetative, flowering, fruiting, and fruit dehiscence phases was also recorded for each species in 1993. For the few ramets that actually reproduced, fruit set was quantified as an index of reproductive output. Because the two dominant forest floor herbs, Uvularia sessilifolia L. and Maianthemum canadense Desf. showed accelerated appearance in heated plots (see below), their photosynthetic rates were characterized to investigate whether soil warming was influencing plant metabolism. One ramet per species growing naturally in full sun (more than 600 Em-2s-1) and one growing in shade (less than 300 Em-2s-1) was selected in each subplot (n = 6 ramets/species/light environment/soil treatment; total = 72). In situ photosynthesis measurements were made on one fully expanded leaf per ramet between 10 am and 2 pm (cloudless day), May 22, 1994, using a Li-Cor 6200 Photosynthesis system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) fitted with a 1/4-litre cuvette. Sun and shade ramets were examined to obtain a range of photosynthesis values for each species, and to ensure that treatment effects were not obscured by light limitation."

00079-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Growth and phenology of woody vegetation Beginning in April 1992, the spring following initiation of soil warming, all woody individuals between 5 mm and 35 mm basal diameter were identified to species (Table 1) and labelled with numbered plastic tags wrapped around the main stem. A subset of larger trees was also monitored (n=12 in heated and control plots; n=15 in disturbance-control plots). Total sample sizes were 109 woody individuals in control and heated plots, and 115 in disturbance-control plots. In April and September of 1992 and 1993, diameter (± 0.1 mm) was measured at two orthogonal locations at the base of the main stem of each plant, as an index of growth over the season. To obtain mean relative diameter increments from April to September 1992 and 1993, the orthogonal diameter measures at each sampling date were first averaged. Relative increments were then calculated for each year separately as ((AvgDiamSept - AvgDiamApr)/AvgDiamApr). Resulting values were arcsin-square root transformed to equalize variances, and investigated with ANOVA using soil treatment as a fixed factor in a randomized block design. At 8 spring-summer sampling dates in 1992 and 13 sampling dates in 1993, the phenological status of each of the marked woody individuals was noted. Individuals were inspected for evidence of leaves and reproductive structures, and placed into 1 of 8 phenological states occurring roughly in chronological order: 1) leaf buds closed; 2) buds opening; 3) new leaves expanding; 4) fully expanded leaves with emerging new leaf pair; 5) reproductive (flowers or fruits present); 6) more than 50 % of leaves changing color; 7) more than 50 % of leaves brown or abscised; 8) all leaves dropped. For statistical analyses, data on the phenology of reproduction and leaf production were considered separately. Percentages of all woody individuals reproducing per quadrat were calculated for each year, in three growth classes: trees (greater than 25 cm basal diameter), saplings ( 25 cm basal diameter), and shrub species. Six values of percent reproductives per treatment per growth class per year were obtained. Individuals on which folivory occurred were recorded. Mortality of labelled individuals was noted. In order to quantify average area per leaf and leaf expansion rates throughout the 1992 season, we measured the length of the midrib of at least six randomly chosen leaves per plant, in shrubs and saplings in each plot. Leaf area was calculated subsequently from non-destructive leaf length measures, from quadratic regressions of leaf area on leaf length obtained for a sample of 60 randomly collected leaves from each species (r2 between 0.925 and 0.977). Community structure, physiology and population dynamics of herbaceous species In each 5 x 5 m plot, a 1 x 1 m subplot was randomly designated for monitoring herbaceous flora (less than 5 mm basal diameter) and tree seedlings (species appear in Table 1). Each subplot was observed from 1992-1993. At all sampling dates, all ramets of each species present in the subplot were counted to determine stem density (per m2). Species richness, diversity and evenness values per plot were derived from these censuses. Diversity was calculated as the Shannon-Weiner index H = - piln(pi) where pi is the proportion of the ith species in each subplot. Evenness was scored as J = H /ln(S) where S = species richness in each subplot (scale of 0 to 1 where 0 indicates disproportionate dominance of a few taxa). As an index of vegetative propagation activity and ramet mortality, relative changes in ramet density from 5 June 1992 to 17 May 1993 (dates of density maxima) were computed as ((Density1993 - Density1993)/(Density1992)). The percentage of individuals in vegetative, flowering, fruiting, and fruit dehiscence phases was also recorded for each species in 1993. For the few ramets that actually reproduced, fruit set was quantified as an index of reproductive output. Because the two dominant forest floor herbs, Uvularia sessilifolia L. and Maianthemum canadense Desf. showed accelerated appearance in heated plots (see below), their photosynthetic rates were characterized to investigate whether soil warming was influencing plant metabolism. One ramet per species growing naturally in full sun (more than 600 Em-2s-1) and one growing in shade (less than 300 Em-2s-1) was selected in each subplot (n = 6 ramets/species/light environment/soil treatment; total = 72). In situ photosynthesis measurements were made on one fully expanded leaf per ramet between 10 am and 2 pm (cloudless day), May 22, 1994, using a Li-Cor 6200 Photosynthesis system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) fitted with a 1/4-litre cuvette. Sun and shade ramets were examined to obtain a range of photosynthesis values for each species, and to ensure that treatment effects were not obscured by light limitation."

00080-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Sampling was done by using a clean plastic scoop and collecting soil to a 10-cm depth. Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration, moisture content, and salinity analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 10 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (>20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at 4C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening . A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum soil can, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105C for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

00084-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations and datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE.

It was transferred to INSTAAR in late 1997, where it was stored in a Microsoft Access database, and presented on the web in ascii, comma delimited files. In October, 1999 Mike Gooseff submitted the 1997-98 data to Denise Steigerwald (the data manager) in ascii, comma delimited files. In order to prepare the files for use in an Oracle database as well as a geographic information system, Denise created a field for 'strmgageid' (stream gage id), converted any time fields of 24:00 to 0:00 on the following day, combined the date and time fields into one date/time field, and separated the data into separate files for each station. Data which was previously presented according to decade collected is now presented according to location, and contains records from the start date of monitoring for a given stream gage. The resulting files are available through the links provided above.

00085-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Dataset AbstractThis study provides a gradient of nitrogen fertilization under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Nitrogen applications range from 0 to 291 kg N/ha . Plots are 5×30 m arranged in each of 4 replicate blocks. The crop rotation (wheat, corn, soybean) follows the pattern of the main site. The study started in 2002 as a rainfed only study on the south end of the main site. In 2005 a new rainfed and irrigated study was started at the south end of the lysimeter field. The original study site was discontinued in 2006. Crop yields, nitrous oxide and soil temperature, moisture and nitrogen data are available for this study. Treatments are numbered as follows: 1 = 0 kg N/ha, 2= 34 kg N/ha, 3= 67 kg N/ha, 4= 101 kg N/ha, 5= 134 kg N/ha, 6= 168 kg N/ha, 7 = 202 kg N/ha, 8= 246 kg N/ha, 9= 291 kg N/ha.original data source http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datasets/36"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

00087-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Lake water samples were collected at specific depths with a five-liter Niskin bottle during normal LTER limnological sampling. Sub-samples were decanted into three 1-L Nalgene bottles (2-light and 1-amber), two-500 mL amber Nalgene bottles, three-150 mL borosilicate glass bottles, two-20 mL scintillation vials, and one-30 mL serum vial. Five-20 mL scintillation vials (3-live treatments, 2-kill treatments) were prepared at each depth for TDR analysis. TDR samples (10 mL) were taken from the one-liter amber Nalgene bottle and placed in each scintillation vial. 0.5 mL filtered formalin (0.2 micro m) was pipetted into each killed treatment vial. 3H Thymidine was pipetted into each vial (final concentration of 20 nM thymidine), first the live treatments and then the kill treatments. Samples were incubated in the dark at 1-4 degC for 20 hours (thymidine incorporation has been shown to be linear for 20 hours under these conditions, Priscu unpublished). At the end of the incubation period 10 mL of ice cold 10 percent TCA was added to stop thymidine uptake and precipitate nucleotides. Vials were stored at 4 degC until filtered. Each sample was filtered through a 0.2 micro m Nucleopore polycarbonate membrane filter. Both the scintillation vial and filter tower were rinsed three times with 5 percent TCA. Each filter was placed into a new scintillation vial and 15 mL of Cytoscint cocktail was added. Samples were counted with a pre-calibrated (3H) liquid scintillation counter. Thymidine uptake rate (TDR nM d-1) was calculated using the following equation: nM TDR/day = (DPML - DPMK) * a /(alpha * t) where DPML is the average dpm for the live treatment, DPMK is the average dpm for the kill treatment, a is the final concentration of thymidine in each vial (20nM), alpha is the total dpm added to each vial, and t is the incubation period. The thymidine uptake rate was adjusted to the ambient lake temperature using the Arrhenius equation: TDRadj = TDR * e^(Ea (( 1 / (CI + 273 K)) - ( 1 / (CA + 273K))) / R ) where Ea is the energy of activation (12,600 cal mol-1, Q10 = 2.2), degCI is the incubation temperature (degC), degCA is the ambient lake water temperature at specific depth, and R is a gas constant (1.987 cal mol-1 K-1). During the 0607 season, the Priscu group did a comparison of the 'filtration method' used in previous seasons (see above and also Appendix 6.11 'Previously used Methods' of the Limnological Methods Manual; Takacs, C.T. and J.C. Priscu. 1998. Bacterioplankton dynamics in the McMurdo Dry Valley lakes: Production and biomass loss over four seasons. Microbial Ecology 36:239-250), with the 'centrifugation method' used by the Palmer (PAL) LTER (Fuhrman, J. A. and F. Azam. 1982. Thymidine incorporation as a measure of heterotrophic bacterioplankton production in marine surface waters: evaluation and field results. Marine Biology 66:109-120). Results showed no significant difference between the two methods (ELB 0-20 m: mean and standard deviation of nM TDR/d determined via filtration method, 0.0114 and 0.0097, respectively; mean and standard deviation of nM TDR/d determined via centrifugation method, 0.0129 and 0.0131, respectively; paired t-test T value, -1.063; P value, 0.328). We therefore continued measurement of bacterial production in seasons following the 0607 season using the centrifugation method. We also complemented our thymidine data with 3H-leucine incorporation data, as is done in the PAL LTER, for selected seasons for comparative purposes. The new method via centrifugation is as follows: Lake water samples were collected at specific depths with a five-liter Niskin bottle during normal LTER limnological sampling. Sub-samples were decanted into two 1-L Nalgene bottles (amber). Five-2 mL microcentrifuge tubes (3-live treatments, 2-kill treatments) were prepared at each depth for TDR or Leu analysis. 3H Thymidine or Leucine was pipetted into each live treatment tube (final concentration of 20 nM). Samples (1.5 mL) were taken from a one-liter amber Nalgene bottle and placed in each tube (both live and kill treatments). Live tubes were capped, inverted several times, and incubated in the dark at 1-4 deg C for 20 hours (thymidine incorporation has been shown to be linear for 20 hours under these conditions, Priscu unpublished). 100 micro L of ice cold 100 percent TCA was added to each kill treatment tube. Tubes were capped, inverted several times, and placed on ice for 15 minutes. 3H Thymidine or Leucine was pipetted into each kill treatment tube (final concentration of 20 nM). Tubes were capped and incubated in the dark at 1-4 deg C for 20 hours. At the end of the incubation period, 100 micro L of ice cold 100 percent TCA was added to the live treatment tubes to stop thymidine or leucine uptake and precipitate nucleotides. Samples were inverted and placed on ice for 15-30 minutes. All tubes were stored at 4 deg C until processing. Each sample was centrifuged at 14,000 (~15,000 x g) for 15 minutes. Supernatant was poured out and tube was tapped to get the last drops out of the tube. 1 ml of cold 5 percent TCA was added to each tube. Tubes were re-spun for 5 minutes, supernatant poured out, and tube tapped to get the last drops out. 1 ml of cold 80 percent ethanol was added to each tube. Tubes were re-spun for 5 minutes, supernatant poured out, and tube tapped to get the last drops out. Tubes were dried overnight in fume hood with caps off. 1 ml of Cytoscint ES scintillation cocktail was added to each tube, tubes were vortexed, and samples were counted with a pre-calibrated (3H) liquid scintillation counter. Thymidine or Leucine uptake rate (TDR or Leu nM d-1) was calculated using the following equation: nM TDR or Leu day -1 = ((DPML - DPMK) * a) / (alpha * t) where DPML is the average dpm for the live treatment, DPMK is the average dpm for the kill treatment, a is the final concentration of thymidine in each vial (20nM), alpha is the total dpm added to each vial, and t is the incubation period. The thymidine or leucine uptake rate was adjusted to the ambient lake temperature using the Arrhenius equation: TDR or LEU adj = TDR or Leu * e^(Ea (( 1 / (CI + 273 K)) - ( 1 / (CA + 273 K))) / R ) where Ea is the energy of activation (12,600 cal mol-1, Q10 = 2.2), degCI is the incubation temperature (degC), degCA is the ambient lake water temperature (degC) at specific depth, and R is a gas constant (1.987 cal mol-1 K-1)."

The raw data files listed under 'file name' are the names of the original files submitted. The 1993/94 and 1994/95 datasets are Microsoft Excel version 6.0 files, and the 1995/96, 1996/97 and 1997/98 datasets are ascii text files. Upon arrival at INSTAAR, the data manager fine-tuned the location codes and limno runs to match those provided in the 'locations, dates, codes for lake chemistry, biology samples' file. The file was imported into Microsoft Access on INSTAAR's Unix system, and can currently be found there. The file was then exported in ascii, comma delimited text and MS-DOS text (table layout) on the MCM LTER web site. Both of these files are linked to this web page above. Information for the metadata was obtained from the Metatdr9697.rtf file. The file was called up using Microsoft Word version 6.0. Text from this file was used to create this page in html format. Per A. Chiuchiolo and J. Priscu suggestion, 4 columns were added to the data table to reflect new methodologies: Starting season 06/07, we included Leucine measurements in our bacterial production assay, and we also started a new method and did comparisons with the old method."

At each site 3 trapping webs are sampled for 3 consecutive nights in spring and fall. Not all sites have been trapped for the entire period. Each trapping web consists of 145 rebar stakes numbered from 1-145. There are 148 traps deployed on each web: 12 along each of 12 spokes radiating out from a central point (stake #145) plus 4 traps at the center point. The trapping sites are representative of Chihuahuan Desert Grassland, Chihuahuan Desert Shrubland, Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, Juniper Savanna, Plains-Mesa Sand Scrub and Blue Grama Grassland."

00090-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Sampling Design Permanent capture-mark-release trapping webs were used to estimate density (number of animals per unit area) of each rodent species at each site. The method makes use of concepts from distance sampling, i.e., point counts or line-intercept techniques. The method makes no attempts to model capture-history data, therefore it was not necessary to follow individuals through time (between sessions). Distance sampling methods allow for sighting or detection (capture) probabilities to decrease with increasing distance from the point or line. The modeling of detection probability as a function of distance forms the basis for estimation. Trapping webs were designed to provide a gradient of capture probabilities, decreasing with distance from the web center. Density estimation from the trapping web was based on three assumptions:1. All animals located at the center of the web were caught with probability 1.0; 2. Individuals did not move preferentially toward or away from the web center; 3. Distances from the web center to each trap station were measured accurately. Each web consisted of 12 trap lines radiating around a center station, each line with 12 permanently-marked trap stations. In order to increase the odds of capturing any animals inhabiting the center of a web, the center station had four traps, each pointing in a cardinal direction, and the first four stations of each trap line were spaced only 5 m apart, providing a trap saturation effect. The remaining eight stations in a trap line were spaced at 10 m intervals. The web thus established a series of concentric rings of traps. Traps in the ring nearest the web center are close together, while the distances separating traps that form a particular ring increase with increasing distance of the ring from the web center. The idea is that the web configuration produces a gradient in trap density and, therefore, in the probability of capture. Three randomly distributed trapping webs were constructed at each site. The perimeters of webs were placed at least 100 m apart in order to minimize homerange overlap for individuals captured in the outer portion of neighboring webs. Measurement TechniquesEach site containing three webs was sampled for three consecutive nights during spring (in mid May or early June) and summer (in mid July or early August for years 1989 to 1993, then mid September to early October for years 1994 through 2000). In that rodent populations were not sampled monthly over the study period, there is no certainly that either spring or summer trapping times actually captured annual population highs or lows. Based on reproductive data in the literature, an assumption was made that sampling times chosen represent periods of the year when rodents have undergone, and would register, significant seasonal change in density. During each trapping session, one Sherman live trap (model XLF15 or SFAL, H. B. Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, FL) was placed, baited with rolled oats, and set at each permanent, numbered station (four in the center) on each web, for a total 444 traps over three webs. Traps were checked at dawn each day, closed during the day, and reset just before dusk. Habitat, trap station number, species, sex, age (adult or juvenile), mass, body measurements (total length, tail length, hind foot length, ear length), and reproductive condition (males: scrotal or non-scrotal; females: lactating, vaginal or pregnant) were recorded for each initial capture of an individual. Each animal was marked on the belly with a permanent ink felt pen in order to distinguish it from other individuals during the same trapping session. The trap station number for an initial capture related to a particular trapping ring on a web and, therefore, to a particular distance from the center of the web. The area sampled by a ring of traps was computed based on circular zones whose limits are defined by points halfway between adjacent traps along trap lines; an additional 25 m radius was added to the outer ring of traps in order to account for homerange size of individuals caught on the outer ring.Analytical ProceduresArea trapped and number of individuals caught for each ring of traps was the basis for estimating the probability density function of the area sampled. The program DISTANCE produced the estimators used to calculate density. Where sample size for a particular species and web was less than an arbitrarily chosen n=10, the number of individuals captured during that session was simply divided into the area of the web plus the additional 25 m radius (4.9087 ha). This dataset includes only the raw capture data.  Sherman live traps: model XLF15 or SFAL, H. B. Sherman Traps, Tallahassee, FL"

The purpose of this experiment was to quantify the time scales of response to the arrival of water after many years of dessication. This table contains data showing the percent of total biomass (abundance) represented by algal type (brown, red, orange or green), phylum, species and morphotype for the Relict Channel in the Fryxell basin."

00091-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Within each transect, algal mats were visually identified as either orange, red, black, or green. Not all types of algal mats were found within every transect. A maximum of five algal samples of each color were collected from each transect using a #13 cork borer (diameter = 17 mm, area = 227 square mm). Algal samples were preserved in 10% formalin for laboratory identifications. Preserved algal samples were examined in the laboratory to determine species composition and relative abundance using a Nikon Diaphot phase contrast microscope. Samples were well mixed to attain an even (random) sampling of mat (some small 'clumps' of algae were still present, but these did not affect the objectives of the study), and then subsamples of 2 ml were withdrawn. Each subsample was placed in a 2-ml settling chamber with a 26 mm diameter and examined at x400 magnification. To get a representative count of relative species abundance, seven random fields (a total of 0.44 square mm) needed to be examined per subsample. Within each field, algae were identified to genus and species where possible (excluding diatoms, which were counted but not identified.) Percent cover was determined in each field by measuring the length and width of all specimens using an ocular micrometer. Cell 'depth' was also measured in order to estimate biovolume. All seven fields were then tallied, and the percentage of the total algal biomass was determined for each taxa. Taxonomic identifications were primarily based on the classical Antarctic literature."

00092-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"RESEARCH LOCATIONS: Imnavait Creek, Alaska 2004: Cover estimates were made once on the 15 flux plots along the topographic sequence of the west facing slope of Imnavait Creek catchment. Toolik Lake, Alaska 2004: Cover estimates were made once on the 20 flux plots in treatment (N +P) and control blocks of the LTER terrestrial fertilisation experiment at Toolik Lake, including the moist acidic tussock, non-acidic tussock, non acidic non-tussock, inlet wet sedge and heath sites. Abisko, Sweden 2004. Cover estimates were made once on the 11 plots at the Stepps site, 13 plots at Paddus and 12 plots at Latnjajaure. Abisko, Sweden 2005. Cover estimates were made on 15 flux plots at the Stepps site each time flux measurements were made (3 times through June/early July and once in mid August). Svalbard 2005. Cover estimates were made once on 41 flux plots at various sites in Adventdalen. Zackenberg 2006. Data were collected on 35 1 x 1m plots and 25 0.3 x 0.3m plots across a range of vegetation types. 13 of the 0.3 x 0.3m plots were located within 1m x 1m plots (identified by plot name with suffix 'b1, b2 or b3'), the remainder were independant of the 1 x 1m plots (B14-25). Measurements were made from 8 July through 1 Aug 2006. Toolik, Alaska 2009: Data were collected on nine 1m x 1m plots, three in each vegetation type. Vegetation types included moist acidic tundra (MAT), dry heath (HTH) and wet sedge (WSG). Each plot was measured at approximately 2 weeks intervals from mid-June to mid-August 2009. Anaktuvuk River Burn, Alaska 2009: Data was collected on five 0.7m x 0.7m flux plots along a burn severity gradient during mid-June 2009. Barrow, Alaska 2009: Data was collected on thirteen 0.7m 0.7m flux plots along a moisture gradient during late-July to early-August 2009. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS We estimated absolute percent cover by species for each 1m x 1m flux plot (ie total cover can be > 100%). In 2004 we split the flux plot into 25 sub plots using a grid, we then estimated % cover in each of the sub plots individually and calculated an average. In 2005, 2006 and 2009 we used the same 1m x 1m grid but counted running totals of percentages of each species in squares 1 thru 25 (only the total cover for the flux plot is given). For the 0.7m x 0.7m plots we used a smaller version of the same grid. For the 0.3m x 0.3m flux plots we estimated cover once for the plot as a whole. Each spp is assigned to a growth form, abbreviated as follows: D = deciduous shrub E = evergreen shrub F = forb G = grass GRM = graminoid S = sedge/rush P = pteridophyte B = bryophyte (mosses and liverworts) L = lichen U = unclassified W = water R = rock X = litter or bare or crust ++ = plus other spp Where many graminoids were growing together it was often difficult to judge the individual percentages, so only the total for the growth form is given; the main species present are listed in the comments column. CALCULATIONS: Total vascular cover is the sum of all deciduous, evergreen, forb, grass, sedge, gramnoid and pteridophyte % covers: TotVasc = D + E + F + G + P + S + GRM where TotVasc = total absolute vascular cover D = total deciduous cover E = total evergreen cover F = total forb cover G = total grass cover P = total pteridophyte cover S = total sedge cover GRM = total graminoid cover The abundance of each growth form as a proportion of the total vascular cover is calculated as (for deciduous vegetation): Vasc%Decid = (D/TotVasc)*100 where Vasc%Decid = % of total vascular cover which is deciduous TotVasc = total absolute vascular cover D = total deciduous cover COMMENTS: N.B The category GRM is for 'graminoids' i.e. species growing together whose cover could not be estimated separately as grass or sedge. A plot can have 0% GRM cover and 25% grass cover if only grasses are present. To find total graminoid cover for a plot sum G + S + GRM.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The general approach of this study is the seasonal sampling and analysis of bulk and molecular characteristics of soil/sediment samples from the FCE-LTER sites. Bulk parameters measured are d13C, C/N and %OC, while molecular characterizations are based on detailed biomarker analyses of extractable lipids and CP/MAS 13C-NMR of bulk OM. Preliminary results have allowed to characterize OM source strength throughout the transects, as well as determining other minor OM sources, diagenetic differences based upon OM quality and marine influences in the estuarine areas of the FCE-LTER study area."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

The purpose of this experiment was to quantify the time scales of response to the arrival of water after many years of dessication. This table contains data showing the chlorophyll, carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen concentrations of algal communities and some mosses from the relict channel. The data constitutes the reactivated channel's algal and moss biomass data, along with measurements of the amount of carbon and nitrogen associated with algal mats for construction of nutrient budgets."

00097-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The widespread influence of land use and natural disturbance on population, community, and landscape dynamics and the long-term legacy of disturbance on modern ecosystems requires that a historical, broad-scale perspective become an integral part of modern ecological studies and conservation assessment and planning. In previous studies, the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has developed an integrated approach of paleoecological and historical reconstruction, meteorological modeling, air photo interpretation, GIS analyses, and field studies of vegetation and soils, to address fundamental ecological questions concerning the rates, direction, and causes of vegetation change, to evaluate controls over modern species and community distributions and landscape patterns, and to provide critical background for conservation and restoration planning. In the current study, we extend this approach to investigate the link between landscape history and the abundance, distribution, and dynamics of species, communities and landscapes of the Cape Cod to Long Island coastal region, including the islands of Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Block Island. The study region includes many areas of high conservation priority that are linked geographically, historically, and ecologically. Despite the compelling rationale for examining this coastal region as a whole and for comparing its related, though distinctive geographic areas, an integrated and comprehensive study of the region has never been undertaken. We are investigating regional controls over landscape patterns and community distribution and will focus in detail on the dynamics of sandplain communities, including grasslands, heathlands, barrens, and woodlands, which are unique components of this region and high priorities for conservation. In order to determine the historical and modern abundance and distribution of these community types, and to relate these to historical patterns of land use, fire, windstorms and other disturbances, we are developing: (1) GIS-based, spatially explicit maps of land use, land cover, environment, hurricane characteristics, and cultural features across the region for the historical period (17th C to present), (2) pollen and charcoal diagrams for critical areas where data are currently unavailable and an integrated analysis of data from all studies across this region, (3) analysis of the relationship between high priority communities (sandplain grasslands, heathlands, barrens, and related communities), rare species, and disturbance history, (4) revised conceptual ecological models for sandplain communities and recommendations for ecological goals and management approaches."

00097-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Species List The data file lists all taxa recorded in the sample plots. Taxonomy follows Gleason and Cronquist (1991). In general, codes are formed by taking the first four letters of the genus name and the first three letters of the species name. Where this causes confusion, an eight letter code unique to each taxon is used. Plot Locations Plots are identified by a general location code (2-3 letters) and a plot number (1-999). These two identifiers are also combined into a single six-character code. Because the plots were sampled from a larger set of potential plot locations, plot numbers are not necessarily sequential. Total number of plots = 776 (270 in 1999, 389 in 2000, 117 in 2001). Soil Chemistry For plots sampled in 1999 (CJ series), the two pairs of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples were subsampled (1/8 cup per sample) and combined to make a single composite sample representing the plot, which was then sent to Brookside Labs. For plots sampled in 2000, only one set of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples was collected, and ¼ cup of each was mixed to produce a composite 0-30 cm sample sent for analysis. In some samples, concentrations of certain cations were below the detection limit of the analytical equipment; in these cases, concentrations are listed as “less than x ppm.” Before the soils data can be analyzed quantitatively, these entries will need to be replaced by numerical values. There are no lab soils data for two plots sampled in 2000 (MT 50 and PB 14). Plant Cover Cover of all vascular plant species rooted within the 20 x 20 m plot (also total lichen and bryophyte cover) was estimated on an eight-point scale. Tree Diameters Diameters of all live trees at least 2.5 cm dbh and all standing dead stems at least 10 cm dbh were measured in all plots. Only truly arboreal species were measured; shrubs such as scrub oak and viburnum were not, although individuals of these species routinely exceeded 2.5 cm dbh. Tree Cores One to three cores of the largest sound trees were sampled in plots with trees greater than 5 cm dbh. Cores were taken at 30 cm above the ground. Most cores were mounted, sanded, and counted under a hand lens or microscope. Some cores of young trees were counted in the field and not collected."

00097-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Species List The data file lists all taxa recorded in the sample plots. Taxonomy follows Gleason and Cronquist (1991). In general, codes are formed by taking the first four letters of the genus name and the first three letters of the species name. Where this causes confusion, an eight letter code unique to each taxon is used. Plot Locations Plots are identified by a general location code (2-3 letters) and a plot number (1-999). These two identifiers are also combined into a single six-character code. Because the plots were sampled from a larger set of potential plot locations, plot numbers are not necessarily sequential. Total number of plots = 776 (270 in 1999, 389 in 2000, 117 in 2001). Soil Chemistry For plots sampled in 1999 (CJ series), the two pairs of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples were subsampled (1/8 cup per sample) and combined to make a single composite sample representing the plot, which was then sent to Brookside Labs. For plots sampled in 2000, only one set of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples was collected, and ¼ cup of each was mixed to produce a composite 0-30 cm sample sent for analysis. In some samples, concentrations of certain cations were below the detection limit of the analytical equipment; in these cases, concentrations are listed as “less than x ppm.” Before the soils data can be analyzed quantitatively, these entries will need to be replaced by numerical values. There are no lab soils data for two plots sampled in 2000 (MT 50 and PB 14). Plant Cover Cover of all vascular plant species rooted within the 20 x 20 m plot (also total lichen and bryophyte cover) was estimated on an eight-point scale. Tree Diameters Diameters of all live trees at least 2.5 cm dbh and all standing dead stems at least 10 cm dbh were measured in all plots. Only truly arboreal species were measured; shrubs such as scrub oak and viburnum were not, although individuals of these species routinely exceeded 2.5 cm dbh. Tree Cores One to three cores of the largest sound trees were sampled in plots with trees greater than 5 cm dbh. Cores were taken at 30 cm above the ground. Most cores were mounted, sanded, and counted under a hand lens or microscope. Some cores of young trees were counted in the field and not collected."

Upon request, and under certain arrangements, it can be shipped on media, such as a usb hard drive. The geodatabase is roughly 51.4 Gb in size, consisting of 4,914 files in 160 folders. Although this metadata record and the others like it are not rich with attributes, it is nonetheless made available because the data that it represents could be indeed useful."
