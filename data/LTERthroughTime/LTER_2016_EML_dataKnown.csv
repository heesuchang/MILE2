00000-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Deployment The MicroCAT was mounted inside a protective PVC pipe enclosure and attached to a wooden piling (~12 inch diameter) that was driven firmly into the substrate. The enclosure was constructed from a 10-foot length of 6-inch (internal diameter) PVC pipe that was perforated all over by drilling 1.5-inch holes (at approximately 4-inch spacing); this permits proper water circulation within the enclosure. The bottom of the PVC pipe was submerged about 5 feet below the water surface at low tide and bolted (vertically) to the piling. The MicroCAT was deployed by lowering it into the enclosure on a 0.375-inch stainless steel cable, and bolting the cable to the piling, so that the bottom of the data logger was ~3 inches above the bottom of the PVC pipe. A weighted surveyor's tape was then used to measure the distance from the substrate to the pressure sensor on the MicroCAT for calculation of total water column depth from pressure readings. The mooring was inspected every 1-3 weeks, and any visible fouling of the enclosure or MicroCAT was removed with a brush or scaper.

The stored data was uploaded to a computer using a RS-232 serial cable and Sea-Bird Electronics SEATERM software. The MicroCAT was then cleaned to remove encrusting material and calibrated with a reference instrument at 4 to 5 salinity levels, generally ranging from 30 to 5 PSU. Data Processing Data were processed after each retrieval using custom programs in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (parse_37sm and imp_gcesonde). Depth was calculated from recorded pressure and latitude values, and salinity and sigma-t were calculated from recorded conductivity and temperature values using standard UNESCO algorithms (reference: Unesco. 1983. Algorithms for computation of fundamental properties of seawater, 1983. Unesco Technical Papers in Marine Science No. 44, 53 pp.). Data were then plotted and visually inspected for evidence of biofouling of the conductivity sensor (i.e. prolonged periods of damped tidal oscillation in conductivity signal with no corresponding changes in temperature signal and no wind or rainfall events recorded at nearby monitoring stations, or periods of damped oscillation immediately followed by normal oscillation after instrument maintenance or replacement). Conductivity values recorded during periods of suspected biofouling were flagged as I (invalid) if visible fouling was noted in maintenance logs, and Q (questionable) if no visible fouling was noted. Daily Aggregation The finalized 30-minute resolution data set was filtered to remove any remaining invalid values (i.e. assigned qualifier flags of 'I' = invalid value or 'X' = excise row), then padded with empty rows to produce a monotonic time series data set with even time steps. The data records were then aggregated (grouped) by Year, Month, Day, Site, Longitude and Latitude, and relevant summary statistics were calculated for each measured variable in each group and added as data columns. Quality control rules were defined for each calculated column to flag statistics based on days with more than 35% missing values as invalid, and more than 10% missing values or 35% flagged values as questionable. Columns listing the number and percentage of missing and flagged values in the original data set for each day were also added as data columns for reference by quality control rules. Following aggregation, summary statistics flagged as invalid were removed from the daily-aggregated data set and converted to missing (NaN). 2015-01-01 2015-12-31 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. Altamaha River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -4km to 40km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.582311 -81.237936 31.401403 31.296034 Research Study Conductivity, temperature and pressure were continuously monitored using an autonomous data-logging sensor package (sonde) that was moored to a piling and submerged 1-1.5m below mean low water. The MicroCAT was programmed to autonomously measure and log conductivity, temperature and pressure at a sampling rate of 30 minutes (based on its internal chronometer). Upon retrieval the data was downloaded from the instrument via RS-232 serial communications and processed using custom Matlab(r) procedures to calculate depth (i.e. from pressure and latitude), salinity and sigma-t (i.e. from conductivity and temperature), and date and time components from sample time stamps.

00000-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Deployment The MicroCAT was mounted inside a protective PVC pipe enclosure and attached to a wooden piling (~12 inch diameter) that was driven firmly into the substrate. The enclosure was constructed from a 10-foot length of 6-inch (internal diameter) PVC pipe that was perforated all over by drilling 1.5-inch holes (at approximately 4-inch spacing); this permits proper water circulation within the enclosure. The bottom of the PVC pipe was submerged about 5 feet below the water surface at low tide and bolted (vertically) to the piling. The MicroCAT was deployed by lowering it into the enclosure on a 0.375-inch stainless steel cable, and bolting the cable to the piling, so that the bottom of the data logger was ~3 inches above the bottom of the PVC pipe. A weighted surveyor's tape was then used to measure the distance from the substrate to the pressure sensor on the MicroCAT for calculation of total water column depth from pressure readings. The mooring was inspected every 1-3 weeks, and any visible fouling of the enclosure or MicroCAT was removed with a brush or scaper.

The stored data was uploaded to a computer using a RS-232 serial cable and Sea-Bird Electronics SEATERM software. The MicroCAT was then cleaned to remove encrusting material and calibrated with a reference instrument at 4 to 5 salinity levels, generally ranging from 30 to 5 PSU. Data Processing Data were processed after each retrieval using custom programs in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (parse_37sm and imp_gcesonde). Depth was calculated from recorded pressure and latitude values, and salinity and sigma-t were calculated from recorded conductivity and temperature values using standard UNESCO algorithms (reference: Unesco. 1983. Algorithms for computation of fundamental properties of seawater, 1983. Unesco Technical Papers in Marine Science No. 44, 53 pp.). Data were then plotted and visually inspected for evidence of biofouling of the conductivity sensor (i.e. prolonged periods of damped tidal oscillation in conductivity signal with no corresponding changes in temperature signal and no wind or rainfall events recorded at nearby monitoring stations, or periods of damped oscillation immediately followed by normal oscillation after instrument maintenance or replacement). Conductivity values recorded during periods of suspected biofouling were flagged as I (invalid) if visible fouling was noted in maintenance logs, and Q (questionable) if no visible fouling was noted. Daily Aggregation The finalized 30-minute resolution data set was filtered to remove any remaining invalid values (i.e. assigned qualifier flags of 'I' = invalid value or 'X' = excise row), then padded with empty rows to produce a monotonic time series data set with even time steps. The data records were then aggregated (grouped) by Year, Month, Day, Site, Longitude and Latitude, and relevant summary statistics were calculated for each measured variable in each group and added as data columns. Quality control rules were defined for each calculated column to flag statistics based on days with more than 35% missing values as invalid, and more than 10% missing values or 35% flagged values as questionable. Columns listing the number and percentage of missing and flagged values in the original data set for each day were also added as data columns for reference by quality control rules. Following aggregation, summary statistics flagged as invalid were removed from the daily-aggregated data set and converted to missing (NaN). 2015-01-01 2015-12-31 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. Altamaha River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -4km to 40km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.582311 -81.237936 31.401403 31.296034 Research Study Conductivity, temperature and pressure were continuously monitored using an autonomous data-logging sensor package (sonde) that was moored to a piling and submerged 1-1.5m below mean low water. The MicroCAT was programmed to autonomously measure and log conductivity, temperature and pressure at a sampling rate of 30 minutes (based on its internal chronometer). Upon retrieval the data was downloaded from the instrument via RS-232 serial communications and processed using custom Matlab(r) procedures to calculate depth (i.e. from pressure and latitude), salinity and sigma-t (i.e. from conductivity and temperature), and date and time components from sample time stamps.

Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER is located along three adjacent sounds on the Atlantic coast and includes both intertidal marshes and estuaries. Long-term drivers of climate change, sea level rise and human alterations of the landscape will cause transitions in dominant habitat types (state changes) within the GCE domain by changing the amounts and patterns of water delivery across the landscape. These changes in water delivery can be conceptualized as presses and pulses in river inflow, local runoff, groundwater input, and tidal inundation, which will in turn manifest themselves as changes in salinity and inundation patterns in the domain. The research proposed for GCE-III is designed to address how variations in salinity and inundation, driven by climate change and anthropogenic factors, affect biotic and ecosystem responses at different spatial and temporal scales, and to predict the consequences of these changes for habitat provisioning and carbon (C) sequestration across the coastal landscape. The goals are to: 1) Track long-term changes in climate and human actions in the watershed and adjacent uplands, and evaluate the effects of these drivers on domain boundary conditions. 2) Describe temporal and spatial variability in physical, chemical, geological and biological, and to evaluate how they are affected by variations in river inflow and other boundary conditions. 3) Characterize the responses of three dominant habitats in the domain to pulses and presses in salinity and inundation. 4) Describe patterns of habitat provisioning and C sequestration and export in the GCE domain, and to evaluate how these might be affected by changes in salinity and inundation. These efforts will be synthesized into a synoptic understanding of both biotic and ecosystem responses to variations in salinity and inundation driven by climate change and human activities, which will be used to assess thresholds between habitats and the potential for state changes in the domain.

These efforts will be synthesized into a synoptic understanding of both biotic and ecosystem responses to variations in salinity and inundation driven by climate change and human activities, which will be used to assess thresholds between habitats and the potential for state changes in the domain.

In the lab, these clams were dissected and their adductor muscles removed (adductor muscles were selected because the muscle tissue would give the best representation of long term food sources rather than a brief snapshot if stomach tissue were selected). The muscles of the clams were freeze dried and then ground together using a ball mill. The tissue samples were then weighed out on a microbalance into tins for isotope analysis (deuterium (H), carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S)). Northern Arizona University's isotope lab performed the analyses Water samples were also filtered at several clam collection sites and plants were collected to determine their isotopic composition . Filters were sent directly to Northern Arizona University for analysis.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2).

The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds, except the sonic range which samples every 15 minutes, and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 15 minutes. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval.

The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds, except the sonic range which samples every 15 minutes, and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 15 minutes. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval.

Discharge was measured eight times throughout the summer season. Flow was measured at 20 points along a transect. A Campbell Scientific CR10 data logger was installed about 10m downstream of the Dalton Highway crossing on 14Jun07 and removed on 09Aug07It was located about 10m downstream of the Dalton Highway crossing. The data logger recorded stage height and temperature every ten minutes. The observed stage height is used with the measured discharge to develop a rating curve (y=5e+35x50.375). The rating curve is used to calculate discharge from the recorded stage height values. Arctic LTER Streams Protocols http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/streams/protocol2.html#Stream_discharge"

00005-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This is data for perennial plant vegetation canopy cover measured from all SMES study plots, fall 1995 and fall 2005. The purpose of this data is to provide ground-truth data for comparison with low-level aerial photographs of each study plot. Three, 29 meter lines were measured along three of six rows of the permanent vegetation measurement quadrats. Each line was measured at 10cm resolution for intercepts of perennial plant live canopy cover, and for bare ground. 10cm resolution is comparable to the resolution of the aerial photos. All plants were identified to the species level. These line-intercept measurements are taken once every ten years, at the same time that low-level aerial photographs are taken. These data will be compared to both decadal air photos, and annual measures ofvegetation from one-meter2 quadrats on each plot to provide information on vegetation change over time relative to the various animal exclosure treatments."

00005-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design: There are 2 study sites, the Five Points grassland site, and the Rio Salado creosotebush site. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots, each occupying 1/4 ofeach block. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the top to the north. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner (north-west) of each plot (top being north), and running left (west) to right (east), then down (south) one row, and then right (east) to left (west), and so on. Quadrat/rebar number one is in the northwest corner of each plot, and numbers 1-6 are across the north side of the plot west to east,then quadrat/rebar number 7 is just south of quadrat/rebar number 6, and rebar numbers increase 7-12 east to west, and so on. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left (north-west) corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. How Data Were Collected: 100 meter measuring tapes were attached to the steel re-bar posts marking vegetation quads 1, 3, and 5 on each study plot. The measuring tapes were extended south to the re- bar posts marking quads 36, 34, and 32. Data were recorded for all intercepts of live perennial plant canopy foliage, and for bare ground. The start and end points for each intercept were recorded to the nearest 10 cm on the measuring tape. Intercepts less than 5 cm were ignored, and intercepts between 5 and 10 cm were recorded to the nearest 10 cm. Intercept measurements were only recorded for perennial plant species, and for bare soil. Annual plants and dead perennial plants were ignored. The data were entered in the field on to micro-cassette tape recorders. The taped recorded data were then entered on to MS Excel spreadsheets. A macro statement was used to subtract each observed intercept end measure from the start measure, to produce an intercept measure for each observation. Those data were then converted to space-formatted text files, and combined as one file. In 2006, the 1995 data codes were updated to reflect current Kartesz codes as found on the USDA plants website."

The cells are enumerated by an Altra flow cytometer (with a syringe pump for volumetric sample delivery) simultaniously with argon ion lasers, to distinguish three major populations of photoautotrophs (Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and pico-eukaryotes) and the assemblage of heterotrophic prokaryotes collectively referred to as H-Bact. FCM abundance estimates for each are converted to carbon biomass equivalents using mixed-layer estimates."

00007-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Metadata for BES site - Stream Temperature: Pond Branch (POBR): In the Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, BES) we use the watershed approach to evaluate integrated ecosystem function. The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Pond Branch, an approximately 41 ha completely forested, 'reference watershed.' A detailed description of this site is posted at: http://md.water.usgs.gov/BES/01583570/. Streamflow data for this site are posted at: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/md/nwis/nwisman?site_no=01583570 Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a forested/reference catchment. Theme keywords: stream, watershed, temperature, forested, reference, Baltimore Ecosystem Study Coordinates: Lat/Long 39 28'49' 76 41'16'"

00010-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"We evaluated the effects of a lightning-initiated fire on responses of vegetation communities. Following a fire in July 1998, 25 experimental plots were established on the eastern edge of MacKenzie Flats at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Ten of these plots were located in a Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama)- dominated site, while 15 were established in another area dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama). We evaluated basal and aerial cover of all plant species at the community level using a vertical line point intercept method along transects within plots. Sampling was conducted immediately after the fire during the last week of July 1998, and again in September and October of 2001."

00010-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design - Following a lightning-initiated fire in July 1998, 25 experimental plots were established on the eastern edge of MacKenzie Flats at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. Ten of these plots were located in a Bouteloua gracilis (blue grama)-dominated site, while 15 were established in another area dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama). In the former site, five of the 10 plots were established in burned areas, and the others were positioned in unburned grassland vegetation. In the latter site, five plots were placed in burned areas, five were positioned in unburned grasslands, and the five remaining plots were located in an area that contained a mix of burned and unburned patches of grassland vegetation. Sampling Design - All of the plots in the Bouteloua gracilis-dominated site were 4 m x 16 m. Of the 25 plots where B. eriopoda was more abundant, nine were 4 m x 16 m and 16 were 4 m x 25 m. Regardless of site, all plots were oriented such that the long axis of each was parallel to a topographic gradient running east-west. We sampled vegetation responses on two separate occasions. An initial sampling was conducted immediately after the fire during the last week of July 1998, and a final sample was conducted in September and October of 2001. During each of the two samples periods, four parallel transects were randomly positioned along the long axis of each plot. In 4 m x 16 m plots, transects were 12 m long, and 125 pins were vertically dropped every 10 cm along each transect. Transects were 25 m long in 4 x 25 m plots, and 125 pins were dropped every 20 cm along each transect. Field Methods - Along each transect, vegetation community data were collected using the vertical point transect method (Bonham 1989). At each pin drop, all species that intercepted the pin were recorded in the order in which they were encountered from vegetation canopy to ground level. Additionally, we noted if a pin directly hit a plant species, bare ground, or litter."

00011-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Study Plot Soil Metadata Participants Peter Groffman, Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies Richard V. Pouyat, U.S. Forest Service Introduction The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has established a network of long-term permanent biogeochemical study plots. These plots will provide long-term data on vegetation, soil and hydrologic processes in the key ecosystem types within the urban ecosystem. The current network of study plots includes eight forest plots, chosen to represent the range of forest conditions in the area, and four grass plots. These plots are complemented by a network of 200 less intensive study plots located across the Baltimore metropolitan area. See Baltimore's Vegetation Structure And Its Ability To Remove Air Pollutants And Sequester Carbon Dioxide, online: http://beslter.org/frame4-page_3b_02.html . Plots are currently instrumented with lysimeters (drainage and tension) to sample soil solution chemistry, time domain reflectometry probes to measure soil moisture, dataloggers to measure and record soil temperature and trace gas flux chambers to measure the flux of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane from soil to the atmosphere. Measurements of in situ nitrogen mineralization, nitrification and denitrification were made at approximately monthly intervals from Fall 1998 - Fall 2000. Detailed vegetation characterization (all layers) was done in summer 1998. Data from these plots has been published in Groffman et al. (2006, 2009), Groffman and Pouyat (2009) and Savva et al. (2010). Plot Locations and Characterizations In November of 1998 four rural, forested plots were established at Oregon Ridge Park in Baltimore County northeast of the Gwynns Falls Watershed. Oregon Ridge Park contains Pond Branch, the forested reference watershed for BES. Two of these four plots are located on the top of a slope; the other two are located midway up the slope. In June of 2010 measurements at the mid-slope sites on Pond Branch were discontinued. Monuments and equipment remain at the two plots. These plots were replaced with two lowland riparian plots; Oregon upper riparian and Oregon lower riparian. Each riparian sites has four 5 cm by 1-2.5 meter depth slotted wells laid perpendicular to the stream, four tension lysimeters at 10 cm depth, five time domain reflectometry probes, and four trace gas flux chambers in the two dominant microtopographic features of the riparian zones - high spots (hummocks) and low spots (hollows). Four urban, forested plots were established in November 1998, two at Leakin Park and two adjacent to Hillsdale Park in west Baltimore City in the Gwynns Falls. One of the plots in Hillsdale Park was abandoned in 2004 due to continued vandalism. In May 1999 two grass, lawn plots were established at McDonogh School in Baltimore County west of the city in the Gwynns Falls. One of these plots is an extremely low intensity management area (mowed once or twice a year) and one is in a low intensity management area (frequent mowing, no fertilizer or herbicide use). In 2009, the McDonogh plots were abandoned due to management changes at the school. Two grass lawn plots were established on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in fall 2000. One of these plots is in a medium intensity management area (frequent mowing, moderate applications of fertilizer and herbicides) and one is in a high intensity management area (frequent mowing, high applications of fertilizer and herbicides).

The lawn plots had chambers identical to those used by Bowden et al. (1990) installed flush with the soil surface to allow mowing. These (three per plot, at least 5 m apart and at least 5 m from the plot boundary) consisted of 28.7-cm diameter (ID) by 4.0-cm high polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders which were placed on permanently installed PVC base rings immediately prior to measurement. From 1998 through September 2007, the forest plots had the chambers described by Goldman et al. (1995), constructed from 16.5 cm wide by 20 cm long pieces of PVC pipe fitted with a septum and an air-tight well cap. These chambers were placed 4 cm into the soil and had a total volume of 2 L. Beginning in September 2007, the Bowden et al. (1990) chambers, which are used at many research sites across the world, were installed at the forest sites. A brief period of side by side measurements suggested that the Bowden chambers produce lower gas fluxes than the Goldman chambers. The replacement dates for chambers at different sites are: -Leakin 1 September 2007 -Leakin 2 Septemeber 2007 -Hillsdale 1 Sept 2007 -Oregon Ridge Upper 1 November 2007 -Oregon Ridge Upper 2 November 2007 -Oregon Ridge Middle 1 September 2007 -Oregon Ridge Middle 2 September 2007 At 0, 10, 20 and 30 min following placement of the chamber on the base or installation of the well cap, 9-mL gas samples were collected from gas sampling ports in the center of the chamber top by syringe. Samples were injected into 9 mL evacuated glass vials sealed with septa and aluminum rings. Samples were sent to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (CIES) for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Concentrations of CO2 and N2O are measured on a GC equipped with thermal conductivity and electron capture detectors aligned in sequence. Concentrations of CH4 are measured on a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector. Samples and standards are introduced into this GC via syringe and sample loop. Fluxes were calculated from the linear rate of change in gas concentration, the chamber internal volume and soil surface area. Spike standards are processed along with each batch of flux samples. These standards are generated by filling sample vials from a standard tank in the field laboratory in Baltimore and then processing these samples along with samples taken from flux chambers in the field. Percent recoveries of the trip standards are used to correct flux values for leakage or gas absorption that may occur between sampling and analysis. Exceptionally low recoveries for N2O (traced to a change in septa manufacture) led to loss of flux data for this gas for several dates from 2007 - 2009.

00011-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Trace Gas Analysis Trace gas (N2O, CO2, and CH4) fluxes from soil to the atmosphere were measured every four to six weeks at each plot using an in situ chamber design. The lawn plots had chambers identical to those used by Bowden et al. (1990) installed flush with the soil surface to allow mowing. These (three per plot, at least 5 m apart and at least 5 m from the plot boundary) consisted of 28.7-cm diameter (ID) by 4.0-cm high polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders which were placed on permanently installed PVC base rings immediately prior to measurement. From 1998 through September 2007, the forest plots had the chambers described by Goldman et al. (1995), constructed from 16.5 cm wide by 20 cm long pieces of PVC pipe fitted with a septum and an air-tight well cap. These chambers were placed 4 cm into the soil and had a total volume of 2 L. Beginning in September 2007, the Bowden et al. (1990) chambers, which are used at many research sites across the world, were installed at the forest sites. A brief period of side by side measurements suggested that the Bowden chambers produce lower gas fluxes than the Goldman chambers. The replacement dates for chambers at different sites are: - Leakin 1 September 2007 - Leakin 2 September 2007 - Hillsdale 1 Sept 2007 - Oregon Ridge Upper 1 October 2007 - Oregon Ridge Upper 2 October 2007 - Oregon Ridge Middle 1 September 2007 - Oregon Ridge Middle 2 September 2007 At 0, 10, 20 and 30 min following placement of the chamber on the base or installation of the well cap, 9-mL gas samples were collected from gas sampling ports in the center of the chamber top by syringe. Samples were injected into 9 mL evacuated glass vials sealed with septa and aluminum rings. Samples were sent to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (CIES) for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Concentrations of CO2 and N2O are measured on a GC equipped with thermal conductivity and electron capture detectors aligned in sequence. Concentrations of CH4 are measured on a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector. Samples and standards are introduced into this GC via syringe and sample loop. Fluxes were calculated from the linear rate of change in gas concentration, the chamber internal volume and soil surface area. Spike standards are processed along with each batch of flux samples. These standards are generated by filling sample vials from a standard tank in the field laboratory in Baltimore and then processing these samples along with samples taken from flux chambers in the field. Percent recoveries of the trip standards are used to correct flux values for leakage or gas absorption that may occur between sampling and analysis. Exceptionally low recoveries for N2O (traced to a change in septa manufacture) led to loss of flux data for this gas for several dates from 2007 - 2009."

The experiment brings together regional land managers to create comparative eradications of garlic mustard at nine distinct sites along a natural climate and nitrogen deposition gradient in New England. This dataset represents baseline plant abundances from 2013 at nine study plots in Harvard Forest. Species richness, Shannon diversity, and Pielou’s evenness were not different between invaded and non-invaded plots at Harvard Forest."

00014-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In this larger study, we are asking the question: Is old carbon that comprises the bulk of the soil organic matter pool released in response to thawing of permafrost? We are answering this question by using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure radiocarbon isotope ratios in soil organic matter, soil respiration, and dissolved organic carbon, in tundra ecosystems. The objective of these proposed measurements is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the SOM sources contributing to C losses following permafrost thawing. We are making these measurements at an established tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. Field measurements center on a natural experiment where permafrost has been observed to warm and thaw over the past several decades. This area represents a gradient of sites each with a different degree of change due to permafrost thawing. As such, this area is unique for addressing questions at the time and spatial scales relevant for change in arctic ecosystems. In this study we examined how Arctic terrestrial invertebrate communities are affected by thawing permafrost through the changes in plant productivity, quality, and composition. Using a natural permafrost gradient in the Alaskan tundra we sampled the invertebrates in the summer of 2015. Specifically we asked (1) how do invertebrate communities differ with thawing permafrost, and (2) are invertebrate community differences due to changes in plant composition, productivity or quality."

00014-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design The study site at the Eight Mile Lake watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope at this site, in a 30 m deep borehole that was installed in 1985 before the permafrost started to thaw. While permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding depending on local topography, this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands. In this watershed, we monitored three sites that represented differing amounts of change as a result of permafrost thaw based on observations of ground subsidence and depth of thaw. Our minimal thaw site had the shallowest summer thaw depth and the least ground surface subsidence, and the vegetation was typical moist acidic tundra, dominated by the tussock-forming sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, with coexisting deciduous and evergreen shrubs, and an understory of mosses and lichens. A second site, located adjacent to the borehole, had moderate summer thaw depths and increased ground subsidence. Here the vegetation composition was similar to our minimal thaw site, but with increased biomass of all plant groups. Lastly, an extensive thaw site was located in an area where permafrost degradation had occurred at least several decades prior to the establishment of the borehole; thermokarst can already be observed in air photos of the area taken in 1954. This site had the deepest summer thaw depth and the most ground subsidence, and the plant biomass has shifted to dominance by shrubs, including blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), at the expense of sedges. Methods FIELD: In the natural permafrost gradient site (Gradient), three sites (extensive, moderate and minimal) with six plots (each plot has two subplots of size 70 x 70 cm) each were set up in 2004. These sites were chosen by the level of their active layer thickening and amount of vegetation change due to differing durations of permafrost thaw. Each subplot in the natural gradient site was vacuum sampled for one minute to collect invertebrates on July 4th 2015. LAB: Using a light microscope we identified the invertebrates as morphospecies. Our definition of morphospecies are invertebrates that are morphologically different. We also identified the invertebrates to the most detailed taxa group possible with the resources that were available at the time, and where possible as predators, herbivores, decomposers, or parasitoids. EML -- Tussock tundra at treeline with permafrost thaw and thermokarst. This site is in the Eight Mile Lake Watershed, west of the town of Healy on Stampede Road, Interior Alaska. This area contains three sites on a permafrost thaw gradient and a nearby experimental snow fence manipulation..

00016-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Patterns of biodiversity, such as the increase toward the tropics and the peaked curve during ecological succession, are fundamental phenomena for ecology. Such patterns have multiple, interacting causes, but temperature emerges as a dominant factor across organisms from microbes to trees and mammals, and across terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments. However, there is little consensus on the underlying mechanisms, even as global temperatures increase and the need to predict their effects becomes more pressing. The purpose of this project is to generate and test theory for how temperature impacts biodiversity through its effect on biochemical processes and metabolic rate. A combination of standardized surveys in the field and controlled experiments in the field and laboratory measure diversity of three taxa -- trees, invertebrates, and microbes -- and key biogeochemical processes of decomposition in seven forests distributed along a geographic gradient of increasing temperature from cold temperate to warm tropical. This data set captures abundance of OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) sampled for in forest soils at the Gigante Peninsula plots in Panama. Prior to macrosystems collection, these plots had been fertilized with N, P, K, and micronutrients for 14 years. This data represents abundance of ITS (fungi) genes in soil samples at Gigante processed by the University of Oklahoma Institute for Environmental Genomics as part of a macrosystems biodiversity and latitude project supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement DEB#1065836."

YSI Sonde sensors consist of 6150 optical dissolved oxygen probe , 6560 conductivity/temperature probe (thermistor) and vented level depth sensor (stainless steel strain gauge). Missing data or blank values are caused by maintenance time periods or where sensor measurements are obviously wrong in the context of what would be expected. For example, the conductivity sensor has a relatively small opening and chamber for the conductivity electrodes, the estuary can have varying suspended sediment/detrital loads moving in the water column which enter the conductivity cell shorting out the electrodes making a faulty conductivity measurement (lower than expected). Oxygen measurements are dependent upon the conductivity measurements so the oxygen also becomes erroneous. Obvious measurements/data errors have been removed from the data set however the user of this data should also conduct their own data analysis to determine if the data are suitable for their particular situation. Typical sensor/data problems are: For oxygen: Poor/inaccurate conductivity measurements will affect the dissolved oxygen accuracy For conductivity: Conductivity cell can have detrital material stuck in it, shorting out cell, resulting in lower than expected conductivity. For depth: Depth strain gage pressure sensor may come out of the water at low tides resulting in many 'zero' depth readings or sometimes negative values. YSI Dissolved oxygen % saturation reporting can vary depending upon how the oxygen is calibrated. For this data set two Oxygen percent saturation values are reported. ODO%YSI variable name represents a YSI calibration in air, from Standard Methods, refers to calibration at a particular ATM pressure which allows DO% for calibration to fluctuate above/below 100% when ATM is above/below reference 760 or 1 ATM ODO%Local variable name represents an oxygen calibration in air at a particular ATM pressure but it forces the DO% to be 100%, does not allow it to be under or above if ATM is above/below 760.

ODO%YSI should not be used since it would require a known ATM pressure at each interval to calculate the ATM % saturation of oxygen to be use for that interval, probably a small correction anyway.

00019-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In the Antarctic Dry Valleys, soil polygons are prominent features of the landscape and may be key units for scaling local ecological information to the greater region. We examined polygon soils in each of the 3 basins of Taylor Valley, Antarctica. Our objectives were to characterize variability in soil biogeochemistry and biodiversity at local to regional scales, and to test the influence of soil properties upon invertebrate communities. We found that soil biogeochemical properties and biodiversity vary over multiple spatial scales from fine (less than 10 m) to broad (greater than 10 km) scales. Differences in biogeochemistry were most pronounced at broad scales among the major lake basins of Taylor Valley corresponding to differences in geology and microclimate, while variation in invertebrate biodiversity and abundance occurred at landscape scales of 10-500 m, and within individual soil polygons. Variation in biogeochemistry and invertebrate communities across these scales reflects the influence of physical processes and landscape development over ecosystem structure in the dry valleys. The development of soil polygons influences the spatial patterning of soil properties such as soil organic matter, salinity, moisture, and invertebrate habitat suitability. Nematode abundance and life history data indicate that polygon interiors are more suitable habitats than soils in the troughs at the edges of polygons. These data suggest that physical processes (i.e. polygon development) and biogeochemistry are an important influence on the spatial variability of biotic communities in dry valley soil ecosystems."

00019-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Â  Â  Â  Â During the 1994-1995 season, two polygons (1 and 2) were sampled at each location. Each 'set' consisted of three polygons and the three linear cracks which separated them. Samples were taken from three intersecting cracks (labelled A0, B0, or C0) outwards towards the middle of the three nested polygons. The middles were labelled AB, BC, and AC. Transect lines were labelled A, B, and C according to the label of the crack crossed. Transect samples were taken at 0.2, 0.4,0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 m on either side of the crack. Positive (+) values were to the right of the crack. Negative (-) values were to the left of the crack. Transect lines were sometimes too short to take an 8.0 m sample. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â During the 1995-1996 season, four contingent polygons were selected as P1, P2, P3 and P4 in a clockwise direction. The middle of the south facing crack was selected as the '0' point and soil samples were taken at 0, 0.2, 0.5, 2, and 5 m along a transect towards the middle of the polygon (in a south to north direction). Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 85 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (greater than20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +5degC until further processing. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. Approximately 200cm3 of soil was placed in a pre-weighed 800mL plastic beaker. Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter were removed from the sample. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum dish, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105degC for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil, and to express data as numbers of soil organisms per unit dry weight of soil. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed. Cold tap water was added up to 650 mL. The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or figure of 8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula. Immediately the liquid was poured into wet screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh. The screens were rinsed gently with ice cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the stack, keeping the screens at an angle as the water filtered through. The water was kept on ice at all times. The top screen was removed, and the lower screen rinsed top down, never directly on top of the soil, but at the top of the screen and from behind. The water was allowed to cascade down and carry the particles into the bottom wedge of the angled screen. The side of the screen was tapped gently to filter all the water through. The suspension was rinsed from the front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to overflow the edge of the screen. The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and rinsing the funnel gently. The suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 1744 RPM. The liquid was decanted, leaving a few mL on top of the soil particles. The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g sucrose per liter of tap water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL. This was stirred gently with a spatula until the pellet was broken up and suspended. The suspension was centrifuged for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube. Samples were refrigerated at 5degC until counted. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Samples were washed into a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x 10 or x20 magnification. Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted. Nematodes were identified to species and sex, and counted. Total numbers in each sample were recorded on data sheets. All species of nematode, and all rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample were recorded. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil. All procedures were carried out in the dark or very low irradiance to avoid degradation of the chlorophyll. The soil samples were mixed thoroughly in the vials, and a sample of approximately 5 g was weighed out in to a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a screw-top cap. 10 mL of a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution was added to each sample and they were mixed thoroughly on a bench-top Vortex mixer for about 5 seconds. The vials were placed in a -4C constant temperature room, in the dark, and left for 12-18 hours. Â  Â  Â  Â Determination of chlorophyll a concentration. This was determined fluorometrically using a Turner model 111 fluorometer. A calibration using a known concentration of chlorophyll was carried out prior to sample analysis. The machine was blanked using a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution. Each vial was mixed thoroughly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 1800 RPM. A sample of approximately 4mL of the DMSO/acetone solution was taken from the top of the sample with a pipette, being careful not to get any soil particles in the solution. The sample was placed in a cuvette, in to the fluorometer and the fluorescence was recorded. This was done fairly quickly in order to prevent light from breaking down the chlorophyll. This measurement is called Fo, the initial fluorescence. After taking this reading, 0.1 mL of 1N HCl was added directly to the cuvette and the cuvette was gently agitated. After 20 seconds, the fluorescence was re-measured. (During this step, the acid converts the chlorophyll to phaeophytin by releasing a magnesium ion in an acidic environment). This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after acidification. The solution was discarded in to a waste container, and the cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90% acetone solution before proceeding with the next sample. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Soil chemistry. We estimated soil salinity by measuring the conductivity of a 1:5 soil solution of the less than2 mm soil fraction in de-ionized water using a Corning 311 conductivity meter calibrated with a 0.01 M KCl solution. We measured the pH of the less than2 mm soil fraction in a saturated paste (1:2 soil in de-ionized water) with an Orion model 720A pH meter. Each soil was air-dried, and ground in a ball mill prior to elemental analysis of acidified and un-acidified soils on a Carlo Erba 1500 elemental analyzer to determine total C and N, and organic C content. Soil inorganic C content was estimated by the difference between total and organic carbon. Â  Â  Â Â  1994-1995 Field Notes Lake Bonney Comments.

00019-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Â  Â  Â  Â During the 1994-1995 season, two polygons (1 and 2) were sampled at each location. Each 'set' consisted of three polygons and the three linear cracks which separated them. Samples were taken from three intersecting cracks (labelled A0, B0, or C0) outwards towards the middle of the three nested polygons. The middles were labelled AB, BC, and AC. Transect lines were labelled A, B, and C according to the label of the crack crossed. Transect samples were taken at 0.2, 0.4,0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 8.0 m on either side of the crack. Positive (+) values were to the right of the crack. Negative (-) values were to the left of the crack. Transect lines were sometimes too short to take an 8.0 m sample. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â During the 1995-1996 season, four contingent polygons were selected as P1, P2, P3 and P4 in a clockwise direction. The middle of the south facing crack was selected as the '0' point and soil samples were taken at 0, 0.2, 0.5, 2, and 5 m along a transect towards the middle of the polygon (in a south to north direction). Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile 'Whirlpak' bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 85 cm diameter circular area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (greater than20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the 'Whirlpak' bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +5degC until further processing. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. Approximately 200cm3 of soil was placed in a pre-weighed 800mL plastic beaker. Rocks greater than 3-4mm in diameter were removed from the sample. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum dish, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105degC for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil, and to express data as numbers of soil organisms per unit dry weight of soil. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed. Cold tap water was added up to 650 mL. The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or figure of 8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula. Immediately the liquid was poured into wet screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh. The screens were rinsed gently with ice cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the stack, keeping the screens at an angle as the water filtered through. The water was kept on ice at all times. The top screen was removed, and the lower screen rinsed top down, never directly on top of the soil, but at the top of the screen and from behind. The water was allowed to cascade down and carry the particles into the bottom wedge of the angled screen. The side of the screen was tapped gently to filter all the water through. The suspension was rinsed from the front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to overflow the edge of the screen. The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and rinsing the funnel gently. The suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 1744 RPM. The liquid was decanted, leaving a few mL on top of the soil particles. The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g sucrose per liter of tap water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL. This was stirred gently with a spatula until the pellet was broken up and suspended. The suspension was centrifuged for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube. Samples were refrigerated at 5degC until counted. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Samples were washed into a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x 10 or x20 magnification. Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted. Nematodes were identified to species and sex, and counted. Total numbers in each sample were recorded on data sheets. All species of nematode, and all rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample were recorded. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil. All procedures were carried out in the dark or very low irradiance to avoid degradation of the chlorophyll. The soil samples were mixed thoroughly in the vials, and a sample of approximately 5 g was weighed out in to a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a screw-top cap. 10 mL of a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution was added to each sample and they were mixed thoroughly on a bench-top Vortex mixer for about 5 seconds. The vials were placed in a -4C constant temperature room, in the dark, and left for 12-18 hours. Â  Â  Â  Â Determination of chlorophyll a concentration. This was determined fluorometrically using a Turner model 111 fluorometer. A calibration using a known concentration of chlorophyll was carried out prior to sample analysis. The machine was blanked using a 50:50 DMSO/90% acetone solution. Each vial was mixed thoroughly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 1800 RPM. A sample of approximately 4mL of the DMSO/acetone solution was taken from the top of the sample with a pipette, being careful not to get any soil particles in the solution. The sample was placed in a cuvette, in to the fluorometer and the fluorescence was recorded. This was done fairly quickly in order to prevent light from breaking down the chlorophyll. This measurement is called Fo, the initial fluorescence. After taking this reading, 0.1 mL of 1N HCl was added directly to the cuvette and the cuvette was gently agitated. After 20 seconds, the fluorescence was re-measured. (During this step, the acid converts the chlorophyll to phaeophytin by releasing a magnesium ion in an acidic environment). This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after acidification. The solution was discarded in to a waste container, and the cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90% acetone solution before proceeding with the next sample. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Soil chemistry. We estimated soil salinity by measuring the conductivity of a 1:5 soil solution of the less than2 mm soil fraction in de-ionized water using a Corning 311 conductivity meter calibrated with a 0.01 M KCl solution. We measured the pH of the less than2 mm soil fraction in a saturated paste (1:2 soil in de-ionized water) with an Orion model 720A pH meter. Each soil was air-dried, and ground in a ball mill prior to elemental analysis of acidified and un-acidified soils on a Carlo Erba 1500 elemental analyzer to determine total C and N, and organic C content. Soil inorganic C content was estimated by the difference between total and organic carbon. Â  Â  Â Â  1994-1995 Field Notes Lake Bonney Comments.

00020-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The LTER acidic tussock site was set up in 1989. The experimental design is four blocks of 5 x 20 meters plots with randomly assigned treatments within each block. Treatments include control (CT), amended with 10 g per square meter of Nitrogen and 5 g per square meter of phosphorus (NP), simple warming with plastic covered greenhouses (GH), simple warming amended with 10 and 5 g per square meter of nitrogen and phosphorus (GHNP) and 50% shade house with and without 10 and 5 g per square meter of nitrogen and phosphorus added (SH and SHNP). Exclosure plots were setup in July 1996 on extra 5 x 20 meters plots within the four-block design of the 1989 LTER acidic tussock experimental plots. On each plot a 5x10 meter section was fenced with large mesh (4-inch square mesh) and within this fence a 5x5-meter plot was fenced with a small mesh (1/2-inch square mesh). In each block two fenced plots were setup: a plot with no fertilizer and a plot with annual fertilization (NP) treatments of 10 g/m2 Nitrogen (as NH4NO3) and 5 g/m2 Phosphorous (as triple superphosphate). In this biomass harvest only the control, 1989 NP (NP13), GH, GHNP, control small mesh (EX), NP unfenced (NP6), and NP small mesh (EXNP) treatments were sampled. Calculations: Units; Tissue mass data are expressed in g/quadrat (400 cm2). Multiply by 25 to get g/m2. Reference Citations: Shaver, G. R. and F. S. Chapin, III. 1991. Production/biomass relationships and element cycling in contrasting arctic vegetation types. Ecological Monographs 61:1-31. Sampling Description. Biomass quadrats, size 20x20 cm, were taken from Toolik tussock site. Five quadrats were taken from each of four blocks. All aboveground biomass was clipped in 20x20 cm quadrats. Five quadrats were randomly located along line transects in each of four replicate blocks in each treatment. Aboveground biomass is considered 'within' the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Quadrats were sorted within 24 hours into species and then into tissue type. Depending on the harvest, tissue types can be broad categories, i.e. above and below, or more detailed, i.e. inflorescences, new growth, old growth, etc. Leaf area was measured with a LiCor LI-3000A area meter. The samples were dried at 60 degrees C in a drying oven and after several days weighed to nearest milligram. Samples are then returned to Woods Hole for nutrient analysis. Details are given in Shaver and Chapin (Ecological Monographs, 61(1), 1991, pg. 1-31). Protocol pers-1"

00020-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The LTER acidic tussock site was set up in 1989. The experimental design is four blocks of 5 x 20 meters plots with randomly assigned treatments within each block. Treatments include control (CT), amended with 10 g per square meter of Nitrogen and 5 g per square meter of phosphorus (NP), simple warming with plastic covered greenhouses (GH), simple warming amended with 10 and 5 g per square meter of nitrogen and phosphorus (GHNP) and 50% shade house with and without 10 and 5 g per square meter of nitrogen and phosphorus added (SH and SHNP). Exclosure plots were setup in July 1996 on extra 5 x 20 meters plots within the four-block design of the 1989 LTER acidic tussock experimental plots. On each plot a 5x10 meter section was fenced with large mesh (4-inch square mesh) and within this fence a 5x5-meter plot was fenced with a small mesh (1/2-inch square mesh). In each block two fenced plots were setup: a plot with no fertilizer and a plot with annual fertilization (NP) treatments of 10 g/m2 Nitrogen (as NH4NO3) and 5 g/m2 Phosphorous (as triple superphosphate). In this biomass harvest only the control, 1989 NP (NP13), GH, GHNP, control small mesh (EX), NP unfenced (NP6), and NP small mesh (EXNP) treatments were sampled. Calculations: Units; Tissue mass data are expressed in g/quadrat (400 cm2). Multiply by 25 to get g/m2. Reference Citations: Shaver, G. R. and F. S. Chapin, III. 1991. Production/biomass relationships and element cycling in contrasting arctic vegetation types. Ecological Monographs 61:1-31. Sampling Description. Biomass quadrats, size 20x20 cm, were taken from Toolik tussock site. Five quadrats were taken from each of four blocks. All aboveground biomass was clipped in 20x20 cm quadrats. Five quadrats were randomly located along line transects in each of four replicate blocks in each treatment. Aboveground biomass is considered 'within' the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Quadrats were sorted within 24 hours into species and then into tissue type. Depending on the harvest, tissue types can be broad categories, i.e. above and below, or more detailed, i.e. inflorescences, new growth, old growth, etc. Leaf area was measured with a LiCor LI-3000A area meter. The samples were dried at 60 degrees C in a drying oven and after several days weighed to nearest milligram. Samples are then returned to Woods Hole for nutrient analysis. Details are given in Shaver and Chapin (Ecological Monographs, 61(1), 1991, pg. 1-31). Protocol pers-1"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Soil frost data is collected in conjunction with snow depth measurements along each snow course. The ground is probed with a ski pole to detect the presence or absence of frost at 2 points adjacent to each of the 10 snow sample points. At the first 2 points for which frost is detected, the soil is excavated and frost thickness is measured. Data from one course are averaged for each collection date."

00022-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This project was designed to investigate the response of plant growth and reproduction to short- and long-term variation in biotic and abiotic environmental variables. Several perennial taxa, including tree (Juniperus monsperma and Pinus edulis), shrub (Larrea tridentata) and bunch grasses (Oryzopsis hymenoides (now Achnaterum hymenoides) and Sporobolus contractus) species, were monitored at 1-3 sites differing in elevation and topography as well as edaphic variables and annual precipitation. The sites represented optimal or marginal/transitional zones for particular species. Demographic measurements were made biannually, after the 'wet' (fall) and 'dry' (spring) seasons. For tree and shrub species, estimates of growth and reproduction were based on branch demography, with ten branch tips from 10-20 individuals per species per site repeatedly measured from 1989-1993.Â  For J. monsperma, P. edulis and L. tridentata, vegetative growth (i.e., branch growth) as well as reproduction were monitored. Additional measurements included needle length for P. edulis and leaf production, leaf size and branchlet production for L. tridentata. For grasses, basal diameter, leaf length and reproduction were monitored for 100 individuals per species per site. This project, SEV006, contains only data on pinon branch demography.Â  Data on other variables and species is contained in SEV024, SEV025, SEV026, SEV027, and SEV028."

Detailed log of alterations/modifications of plant demography data: This portion of the log contains details of all alterations and modifications applied to this file by Michelle Murillo. The file demography.dat was initiated in September 1990 by concatenating individual files into the demography.dat file. A generic header was devised to apply to all individual files. The header reads as such: date season site species station plant# branch# #1 #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #7 #8, and the detailed description of the numbers 1-8 are listed in the documentation section of this file. The individual files were then modified to follow this header, which entailed rearranging of columns (generally the season, site, species, station, plant#, and branch#) and the addition of the date column. As the columns numbered 1-8 did not pertain to all individual files, non-applicables (na) were inserted where necessary. Other alterations included:Â Â Â  1. Juniper 1989: Sepultura Canyon; addition of na's to presence/absence of male or female cones, depending on sex of tree, i.e. if tree was female then na's were inserted in the male column. Goat Draw; same as Sepultura CanyonÂ Â Â  2. juniper 1990: (Sepultura Canyon site has been discontinued) Goat Draw (season 1); orginal file contained x,y and --'s; which were converted to 0 (absence) and 1 (presence) and appropriate na's were inserted, depending on sex of tree Goat Draw (season 2); orginal file contained +'s for presence of cones; which were converted to 1 (presence) and appropriate na's were inserted depending on sex of tree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  NOTE: In 1989 width of branch was measured, and in 1990 this measurement was no longer taken. (The orginal data sheets for 1989-2 are unavailable at the time of archiving, assumption is that this measurement applies to season 2 also ).Â  In 1990 the length of branchlet was measured which was not measured in 1989. (See documentation). Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  NOTE: In 1989 (both seasons) the variable, number of branchlets, was not included. In 1990 the variable was added, but measurements of this variable was sporadic, occuring only in a few plants.Â Â Â  3. grasses 1989/1990: All sites: addition of na's to branch#Error checking was done as follows:Two files, grasses 1990-season 1, and creosote 1990-season 1, had not been entered at the time of concatenation of individual files, and were therefore entered by Michelle Murillo. These two files were error checked by Michelle Murillo by visual checking of original data sheets with the files on 18 December 1990. On 17 December 1990, the expand program was applied to the demography.dat file and placed into the demography.rdb file. The rdb file was then checked for various errors, and the elimination of these errors were completed on 18 December 1990. On 19-20 December 1990, random error checking was conducted by using 'Tables for Statistical Data-Analysis'. One hundred and fifty entries were checked and approximiately 45 percent of the numbers were from 1989-season 2, and because the data sheets were unavailable, the entries were not error checked. On 23 December 1990, visual checking with the original data sheets was conducted for an overall check.File initiated June 1991: MLMseason 1 entered: MLMseason 2 entered: KPMBlack Butte, season 2 entered and error checked, 7 Jan 1992: MLMdata entry complete 25 October 1991:Â  KPMdata error checking completed 8 November 1991:Â  KPM Documentation updated (New people and times added) on 29 Jan 1992 and inserted into data file by Troy Maddux.Â  1992 logÂ Â  Â * Put the 1992 data in the data base on 22 Oct 1992 Troy Maddux.

00024-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Weather data has been collected at Toolik Lake by a Campbell 21x datalogger since June 1988. Sensors that are measured every minute and averaged or totaled every hour include: air temperature and relative humidity at 1 and 5 meters, wind speed at 1 and 5 meters, wind direction at 5 meters, global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, net radiation (Fritschen type), barometric pressure, and unfrozen precipitation. Sensors measured every 10 minutes and averaged every three hours include: soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, and evaporation pan depth and pan water temperature. Net radiation and pan evaporation are only measured during the summer months. The hourly data are in the file 2000DLTLH.DAT, the three hourly data are in 2000DLTLO.DAT, and daily summaries are in 2000DLTLD.DAT. A second Campbell 21x datalogger about 700 meters from the main weather station logs air and soil temperatures and photosynthetically active radiation in the experimental treatment plots. Treatments include greenhouse, shading, and fertilization. In the control plot wind speed and direction, global solar radiation and unfrozen precipitation are also measured. This station is also used as a backup to the main weather station. The full description of the sensors and site is in file SENSORS.DOC. The original data is in file 2000DLTDAT.ZIP which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. Notes: Lake temperature is measured where the lake depth measurement is made. Lake Depth sensor stopped working in December 1998. It was replaced with a temporary 2.5 psi depth sensor for the summer. In August 1999 a 5 psi sensor was installed. See notes under comment variable. Soil temperatures consist of two profiles in a moss dominated plant community. They are within 3 meters of the weather station. Evaporation pan temperature sensor was not placed in the water this summer. Battery lost connection with logger and no data was collected from 24Nov 2000 to June 2001. Sampling Description. None"

A second Campbell 21x datalogger about 700 meters from the main weather station logs air and soil temperatures and photosynthetically active radiation in the experimental treatment plots. Treatments include greenhouse, shading, and fertilization. In the control plot wind speed and direction, global solar radiation and unfrozen precipitation are also measured. This station is also used as a backup to the main weather station. The full description of the sensors and site is in file SENSORS.DOC. The original data is in file 2000DLTDAT.ZIP which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. Notes: Lake temperature is measured where the lake depth measurement is made. Lake Depth sensor stopped working in December 1998. It was replaced with a temporary 2.5 psi depth sensor for the summer. In August 1999 a 5 psi sensor was installed. See notes under comment variable. Soil temperatures consist of two profiles in a moss dominated plant community. They are within 3 meters of the weather station. Evaporation pan temperature sensor was not placed in the water this summer. Battery lost connection with logger and no data was collected from 24Nov 2000 to June 2001. Sampling Description. None"

00025-metadata.xml,Maintenance,/eml:eml/dataset/maintenance,"Â While processing the 1997-98 files, Peter Doran identified an error in the LWRadIn values for the Commonwealth station in 1996-97's data from Julian day 319 of 1996 at 15:45 local time to Â Julian day 27 of 1997 at 9:00 local time. To correct the LWRadIn values during this period the Â values needed to be multiplied by 0.800514. The data manager at INSTAAR did this and provided Â updated versions of the data sets in May, 1999. Â  On August 18, 1999, the data manager added the 1998-1999 data to this dataset. In the process, Â she did some fine-tuning of the data, which included:Â  Â  Â 1. removal of the relative humidity values from November 14, 1996 through December 4, Â 1996, as requested by Peter Doran. Since the temperatures were bad during this period, Â and relative humidity is based on temperature, the RH data needed to be voided as well. Â They had been marked as subjectively voided in the comments field, but needed the Â values removed from the RH field. Â  Â 2. removal of records on 5/20/1994 2:00:00 and 5/20/1994 11:00:00. These contained Â incorrect data. Â  Â 3. removal of SwRadOut values on 12/25/1994 13:00:00, 12/25/1994 13:20:00, and 12/25/1994 13:40:00. These records had very high SwRadOut and no SwRadIn values, so Peter Doran determined that it was best to delete the 3 SwRadOut values. Â  Â 4. removal of ThmIR values of -999.99 from the 1994 data. This was a level 0 campbell code and should not have been in the level 1 data set. Â  Â 5. making the file layout consistent from year to year. This results in many null values being present for periods when certain values were not collected. However, it simplifies combining data from different years. Â  Â 6. making corrections so that the files containing data for a given year started on January 1 at 0:00 and ended on December 31 at 23:45. Up to this point, records for January 1 between 0:00 and 12:45 were appearing in the previous year's file. Â  On August 31, 1999, at the request of Thomas Nylen, more updates were made including: Â  Â 1. removal of wind direction and wind direction standard deviation values for records where Â wind speed = 0; Â  Â 2. removal of all commas from the comments fields, since commas cause spreadsheet Â software packages to add additional columns; Â  Â 3. addition of relative humidity values from Jan 23, 1995 @ 14:20 to Nov 27, 1995 @ 10:20. The task sheet gives no explanation nor data to indicate why it was omitted. The data looks good when plotted, so it was decided to include it. Â  Â 4. addition of ice temperature values (at 20 cm and 1 m depths) from Nov 27, 1995 @ 12:15 to Jan 24, 1996 @ 10:30. Up to this point, the values were omitted from the data column and flagged. Looking at the values before and after this time period, the ice temperature data was also flagged, but the values were left in the data column. The data appears to be continuous across each of these time periods, and it was not logical why one period was omitted, but the before and after values were not. The data between Nov 27, 1995 @ 12:15 and Jan 24, 1996 @ 10:30 was therefore placed back, though flagged. Â  Â 5. addition of wind direction values from Dec 19, 1995 @ 15:15 to Jan 24, 1996 @ 10:15. The task list stated that the arm was rotated 13 degrees on Jan 24. According to Peter Doran, the data should be left, but flagged. Â  Â 6. removal of ThmIR values between 12/19/1995 11:15 and 12/19/1995 13:00. Â  Â 7. updating of SwRadIn and SwRadOut values between Nov 25, 1997 @ 13:00 and Jan 16, 1998 @ 9:45. The wrong multiplier was used for SwRadIn and SwRadOut between Nov 25, 1997 @ 13:00 and Jan 16, 1998 @ 9:45. Two flags for SwRadOut, 01/02/1998 11:30 and 01/02/1998 12:00 were removed with the recalculated values. Â  Â 8. removal of LwRadIn2 and LwRadOut2 values between Jan 1, 1999 and Jan 22, 1999 @ 10:15. These values were bad for the whole dataset. Â  Â 9. removal of 1998-99 IceT20cm values above 0 (above the range limit). Â  Â In May 2000, the 1999-2000 data was posted. In the process, Denise Steigerwald changed the Â layout of the files so that they were sorted by category (air temperatures, humidity, radiation, Â wind etc.) rather than by year. Files containing monthly and daily averages were generated and Â minor adjustments were made to the metadata. Â  Â On May 17, 2000, relative humidity (RH) values were corrected for a systematic error in the measurement created by an instrument manufacturer error. All RH data with air temperatures below freezing were corrected using the vapor pressure over ice (rather than over water which was used initially). The error became quite large for very cold temperatures (the correction could grow to around 30%). The formula used for the correction was: Â  Â RH_corr=RH_orig/((A*temp*temp)+(B*temp)+C) Â  Â where Â RH_corr = corrected relative humidity Â RH_orig = original relative humidity Â temp = air temperature Â  Â A = 4.165E-5 Â B = 9.7E-3 Â C = 1.0 Â  Â For example, with an air temperature of -2.3 and RH_orig of 50.6, the RH_corr will be 51.7. Â  Â Records that showed corrected RH values greater than or equal to 100 were changed to 99.99 and flagged. Â  Â On June 6, 2000, the dataset showing longwave radiation measurements was updated. Thomas Nylen had gone through values recorded before January 22, 1999 and made some changes to these values and their corresponding flags (comments). Many of the fields were originally left blank but have now been assigned an appropriate number. Â In June 2000, summary files were added to the web containing daily and monthly statistics. Â  Â These were generated by creating 'views' of daily and monthly means, minimums, maximums and counts of the records represented in the Oracle database's meteorology tables. Â  Â In April 2003, the LwRadOut2 data were adjusted between 01/20/1999 12:45 PM and 01/23/2003 04:15 PM to account for erroneous dome thermister measurements made by the Eppley precision spectral pyranometer. The problem was identified by Eppley when recalibrating the instrument. The dome and case temperatures should be about the same, Â especially in the winter. The voltage measured by the dome thermister was consistently 9% higher than the case thermister. To correct the problem the dome thermister were divided by 1.09 and the LwRadOut2 values were calculated again using the methods outlined in Procedures for Correcting Eppley Pyrgeometer Data. The revised values were on average 11.2% higher than the previous calculated values. Â  In 2006, metadata was standardized (Chris Gardner and Inigo San Gil) to the EML format. Â  in 2014, metadata was enhanced using the Drupal Ecological Information Management System (Inigo San Gil) Â  In 2015, metadata was checked to conform to new LTER quality demands Â "

00026-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"We are investigating the role of disturbance history, source-sink metapopulation dynamics, and genetic adaptation to different canopy environments in the invasion success of Alliaria petiolata in the New England understory. In these studies, we employ a combination of population-level experiments, metapopulation studies, and landscape-level historical analyses. We have initiated a statewide survey of forested locations to determine the presence and absence of garlic mustard with respect to major pathways of invasion via past and present habitat disturbances. More explicit spatial analyses will test whether past sites of open canopy could have acted as corridors for the spread of invasive populations to present locations. This broad analysis will enable us to evaluate the generality of emerging conclusions from our population-level studies for predicting the broad-scale factors controlling the distribution, pattern and abundance of exotic species. At the population-level, we have begun long term demographic modeling of A. petiolata and experiments to test for habitat-specific natural selection on physiological, phenological, and allocational traits in sites with different canopy structure (edge or understory). In long term demographic analyses, we will use matrix population models to determine the relative contributions of subpopulations in different habitats to forest invasion. In ongoing reciprocal transplant studies, we will asses whether the maternal source habitat of a propagule contributes to its germination and survival in contrasting habitats."

00027-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"An important part of the McMurdo Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) is monitoring of spatial and temporal patterns, and processes that control net primary production (carbon dynamics) in perennial ice-covered lakes. One of the primary losses of carbon fixed by phytoplankton is through respiration, directly by the phytoplankton themselves and secondarily through the metabolic contributions of heterotrophic organisms such as bacterioplankton and protozoa. The coupling of low metabolic activity and supersaturated gases in the water column prohibits a direct measurement of respiration. Therefore, we measure the respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity which drives oxidative phosphorylation, and hence oxygen consumption in all aerobic organisms (Packard 1985). This data set addresses this core area of research and estimates a community-wide respiration rate at specific depths in McMurdo Dry Valley lakes (Hoare, Fryxell and Bonney)."

00027-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Lake water samples were collected at specific depths with a five-liter Niskin bottle during normal LTER limnological sampling. Sub-samples were decanted into three-1 L Nalgene bottles (2-light and 1-amber), two-500 mL amber Nalgene bottles, three-150 mL borosilicate glass bottles, two-20 mL scintillation vials, and one-30 mL serum vial. The two-one liter clear Nalgene bottles were used for the ETS experiment. Depending on the lake and depth at which each analysis was performed, 1000-2000 mL of lake water was filtered through a Whatman 47 mm GF/F filter. The filter was folded in half (organic material inside), placed in a glassine envelope, and stored at 0 degrees Celsius until analysis (&lt;30 min). In an ice bath, the filter was combined with 3 mL of homogenization buffer and homogenized for 90 seconds with a glass/teflon tissue grinder. The mixture was decanted into a cone centrifuge tube; it was centrifuged in the cold for 3 minutes, vortexed for 30 seconds, and centrifuged for another 15 minutes. 0.5 mL of the extract was pipetted supernatant into three 1-cm quartz cuvettes (2 replicate, 1 control) and placed in an ice bath. The control sample was boiled for 10 minutes and cooled in an ice bath. 1.5 mL of substrate solution and 0.5 mL of INT solution was added to each cuvette, vortexed for 30 seconds, and incubated at 1-4C for one hour. The reaction was terminated in the cuvette with 0.5 mL of termination solution. The absorbance was measured at 490 nm with a spectrophotometer. Light absorption by the sample idirectly proportional to the moles of electrons transferred through the electron transport system (ETS). Community ETS (umol O2 L-1 hr-1) was calculated using the following equation: ETS = (AbsR - AbsC) a * b c * t where AbsR is the average absorbance of the replicate samples, AbsC is the absorbance of the control sample, a is ratio of the volume of homogenization buffer to the volume of lake water filtered, b is the ratio of the final volume of reaction mixture in each cuvette to the volume of extract supernatant, c is the extinction coefficient for formazan (31.8 Abs cm-1 umol O2-1), and t is the incubation period. Community ETS was adjusted to ambient lake temperature using the Arrhenius equation: ETSadj = ETS * e^(Ea (( 1 / (CI + 273 K)) - ( 1 / (CA + 273 K))) / R ) where Ea is the energy of activation (15,000 cal mol-1, Q10 = 2.66), CI is the incubation temperature (C), CA is the ambient lake water temperature at specific depth, and R is a gas constant (1.987 cal mol-1 K-1). A first order relationship exists between ETS activity and respiratory capacity in aquatic microorganisms (e.g., Kenner and Ahmed 1975, Christiansen et al. 1980). Our studies have revealed that 44% and 56% of measured ETS activity is from bacterioplankton and phytoplankton, respectively, in Lake Bonney (Takacs and Priscu, unpublished data). Using these relationships, in concert with published respiration:ETS ratios (Packard 1985), we derived a community respiration:ETS ratio of 0.61 for the water column of Lake Bonney. Individual respiration:ETS ratios for bacteria and phytoplankton were computed as 0.513 and 0.097, respectively."

The two-one liter clear Nalgene bottles were used for the ETS experiment. Depending on the lake and depth at which each analysis was performed, 1000-2000 mL of lake water was filtered through a Whatman 47 mm GF/F filter. The filter was folded in half (organic material inside), placed in a glassine envelope, and stored at 0 degrees Celsius until analysis (&lt;30 min). In an ice bath, the filter was combined with 3 mL of homogenization buffer and homogenized for 90 seconds with a glass/teflon tissue grinder. The mixture was decanted into a cone centrifuge tube; it was centrifuged in the cold for 3 minutes, vortexed for 30 seconds, and centrifuged for another 15 minutes. 0.5 mL of the extract was pipetted supernatant into three 1-cm quartz cuvettes (2 replicate, 1 control) and placed in an ice bath. The control sample was boiled for 10 minutes and cooled in an ice bath. 1.5 mL of substrate solution and 0.5 mL of INT solution was added to each cuvette, vortexed for 30 seconds, and incubated at 1-4C for one hour.

Both available N and potentially mineralizable N were greatest following a drought period in 1989, declined during wetter periods that followed and remained relatively stable until another extended drought period. After drought in 1995-6, both forms of soil N increased, indicating the potential for greater NPP following drought and lower potential NPP during periods of normal precipitation."

00028-metadata.xml,Purpose,/eml:eml/dataset/purpose,"This project began as part of a study to identify the interactions between soil inorganic nitrogen supply and El Nino-La Nina oscillations that bring wetter-than-average or drier-than-average (respectively) winter-spring precipitation to the central New Mexico region (El Nino-La Nina Fertilization Experiment). This project was known locally as 'The Fertilizer Study' and was initiated by Dr. Sandra Turner. To test whether soil inorganic N was limiting aboveground net primary production, fertilizer was added to designated plots within a block of study plots. At first, the soil sampling was designed to confirm or establish the actual fertilizer contribution to each site. The amount added was the amount of inorganic N in soils from the fertilized plots minus that in the control plots. The amount in the controls plots was interpreted as being the amount of inorganic N that had not been utilized by the plant/microbial community and was 'available' at that time for utilization in the future. Potentially mineralizable N measurements were performed to determine how the amount of readily mineralizable N was changed by the fertilizer addition; termed a priming effect when the addition of inorganic N results in even greater increases in mineralizable N. Early results from this study were reported at the 1990 Ecological Society of America annual meetings (White et al. 1990). Following the first year's work, measurements of soil available N and potentially mineralizable N were continued. Except in 1990 when a computer hard-drive that contained most of that year's soil N data crashed and the data were not able to be recovered, the period from 1989 until the spring- summer of 1999 was covered by at least one collection per year."
00028-metadata.xml,Supplemental Information,/eml:eml/dataset/additionalInfo,"Additional Information on the Data Collection Period Data collected four times per year (usually January, April, July and October). Sampled one week per season, four seasons per year. Site DescriptionThe fertilizer study was initiated at two locations on the Sevilleta NWR; one on the east side and one on the west side of the refuge. The east side study site was located within a 300m by 300m block on MacKenzie Flats. The vegetation was dominated by black grama and was thought to be a 'typical' black grama desert-grassland. Within that area were 100 ea. 30m by 30m plots (10 plots along the side). The outer 2.5 m of the plot were left as a buffer strip, so the inside 25m by 25m plot constituted the actual sampling unit. When the fertilizer study was no longer active, the plots were sampled to continue the long-term soil record. In 1995, 5 locations along the east 300 m border of the fertilizer study area were established for future soil monitoring. Each of these new sites had soil erosion bridges installed to measure changes in soil microtopography (erosion/deposition). In the methods section are the results of a study that verified that sampling at the 5 new locations gave results comparable to those from the 4 random plots within the fertilizer study area. In 2003, the 5 new locations of 1995 were burned by prescribed fire on 19 June 2003. Additional bridge and soil sites were established within the original fertilizer study area (established in control or untreated plots) and sampled before the prescribed fire to establish similarities to continue the control or untreated soil collections at that area. These new bridge sites are numbered 7196, 7197, 7198, 7199, and 7200.The original study also had a grassland site on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR. This site was west of the Field Station, accessed by entrance at the north gate near Bernardo and following the roadbed of the old highway alignment. This site was dominated by C-3 grasses with C-4 grasses a minor component. Shrubs were primarily 4-wing saltbush. The west side only had room for 61 each 30m by 30m plots. When the fertilizer study was ceased, no further soil collections were made on the west side for long-term study. Method ReferencesDay, Paul R. 1965.

Thus, values given below are based upon application to the 30 x 30 m plot and should be used cautiously. 1989 Protocols In 1989, fertilizer treatments were applied as NH4NO3 in 2 treatment levels with controls (low, high, and no fertilizer). Three plots received 61.8 kg N/ha, three plots received 30.9 kg N/ha, and 3 plots were not fertilized (controls). All of these plots were selected in a random manner. It turned out that plot 7 on the west side was too disturbed to be used, so plot 51 was substituted. On the east side, plot 66 was mistakenly fertilized instead of plot 56, which had been selected, so that plot 66 became the 3rd heavily fertilized plot. Hence the plots used in their respective treatments were as follows: Treatments Â  East sideÂ Â Â  West side ----------Â Â  Â  Â  ----------Â Â Â  ---------- ControlÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  16, 33, 42Â Â Â  16, 33, 42 LowÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  7, 10, 25Â Â Â  19, 25, 51 HighÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1, 26, 66Â Â Â Â  1, 26, 56 The fertilizer was applied in April on the east and west sides. Fertilizer was applied with a cyclone spreader by a person walking 5 equally spaced paths across each plot while cranking the spreader. The light treatment was applied with passes in only one direction, while passes were made in both directions across the plot for the heavy treatments. Soil samples were collected on April 18, 1989, to verify the nitrogen additions and to measure net N mineralization and nitrification potentials. Soil cores (4.2 mm in diameter) were taken to a depth of 20 cm at 4 m intervals along a diagonal from the NE to the SW corner of the plot (starting at the edge of the 2.5 m buffer zone). These cores (15 in all) were placed in the same bag and comprised one sample. The 3 plots represented the sample units (n=3). Plot 66 was not collected until July 4th, when the mistake was identified because plot 56 had no elevated levels of nitrate or ammonium. 1990 Protocols In 1990, it was decided that the number of treatment levels would be reduced to one fertilizer application rate and that the number of replicate treatment plots be increased to 4. Fertilizer was applied in two applications, instead of the single application in 1989, in attempts to reduce 'burning' from the fertilizer. The first application was on March 1, 1990, and the second was April 4, 1990. Over an inch of rain occurred on both the east and west sides between applications. For each application, fertilizer was applied with a cyclone spreader by a person walking 3 evenly spaced passes across each plot in one direction, and then repeating the process in the perpendicular direction. The setting on the cyclone spreader was 3 1/4. The plots used were: Treatments Â  Â  East sideÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  West side ----------Â Â Â Â Â  -------------- Â  Â Â  -------------- ControlÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  24, 34, 43, 48 Â Â  24, 34, 43, 48 HighÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3, 22, 30, 60Â Â Â Â  3, 22, 30, 60 Within each 30m by 30m plot, 3 ea. half-meter-square (1/2 or 0.5 m^2) quadrats were randomly selected for soil sampling within the northwest quarter of the plot (the 12.5 m by 12.5 m portion excluding the 2.5 m buffer). To identify the location of the 0.5 m^2 quadrats, two tape measures were run parallel to each other, one along the top of the plot and the second along the mid-line of the NW quarter. A third tape was run between the two tapes on the edges to locate the long side of the randomly selected 0.5 m^2 quadrats. Along each diagonal, 4 soil cores were taken at equal spacing starting with the corner of the quadrat and ending in the diagonal corner. Soil cores (4.2 mm diameter) were taken to a depth of 20 cm. The 4 cores from the quadrat were placed in the same bag and comprised one sample. Thus, each plot had 3 soil samples, one from each quadrat, with each treatment having 4 plots. Protocols for 1991 through 1994 Starting in 1991 and continuing through 1994, 4 plots were sampled with 3 quadrats in each plot; however, only three soil cores were collected (2 from the opposing corners and one from the middle of the quadrat) per quadrat. As in the other years (except 1989 where only one sample was taken per plot), soils from each quadrat were analyzed separately and later averaged to get the value for the plot (3 replicate soil analyses, one per quadrat, and these values were averaged to get a plot value for each of 4 plots; n=4). Protocols for 1995 to present: Soil Bridges and associated soil collections In 1995, 5 soil bridges were installed about 30 m east of the Fertilizer Plots. The primary function of the soil bridge is to measure small changes in soil microtopography; erosion or deposition. At the time of soil bridge measurements, two soil cores (same dimensions, 4.2 mm diameter to a depth of 20 cm) for initial available N and potentially mineralizable N were collected from vegetated (mostly grass, 2 cores each) and unvegetated (2 cores each) areas that appeared comparable to those areas beneath the soil bridge. The two sample-types (under plants or open soils) were analyzed separately and the 'average' for the bridge was determined by weighting the soil- types by their respective coverages determined beneath the bridge. For example, if vegetation cover was 35% (0.35 of area beneath the bridge had vegetation) and bare soil 65%, the N values for the soil beneath the vegetation were multiplied by 0.35 and summed with the N values for the bare soils multiplied by 0.65. This procedure gave 5 average values for soil N at each collection.+ In the summer of 1998, a study was performed to make direct comparison of the two different collection techniques (collection of soils from fertilizer plots or soils associated with the bridges) and the potential differences the collection method could have on soil nitrogen mineralization potentials. Methods used for comparative study Collection on fertilizer plots (fp): Four plots were randomly selected as per previous methods; 4 each 30 X 30 m plots within a 300 X 300 m study site. Within each plot, three randomly selected 0.5 m^2 quadrats within the 15 X 15 m NW quarter of the plot were selected. Within each 0.5 m^2 quadrat, a soil core (4 cm diameter by 20 cm long) was taken from the NW and SE corners of the plot. Both cores were composited to make one sample from each quadrat. This sampling method gave 3 soil samples for each of four plots, for a total of 12 samples. Collection from the bridge sites: The 5 bridges were equally spaced along the 300 m east border of the fp study area. At each bridge, 2 soil sample cores (4 cm diameter by 20 cm long) were taken from under vegetation cover (under) and 2 from non-vegetative soil surfaces (open). The two cores were composited to give a single soil sample from under and open at each bridge. Analyses of N mineralization potentials: After determining the water holding capacity (WHC; White and McDonnell 1988), a portion of each sample was adjusted to 50% of determined WHC and 5 subsamples were apportioned into plastic cups. Each cup contained approximately 30 g (+/- 0.05 g) dry-weight mineral soil. One subsample of each sample was immediately extracted with 100 ml 2 N KCl for NH4+-N and NO3--N analyses. The remainder of the cups were covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band and incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C. Moisture content was monitored by mass loss and replenished as needed. At days 14, 28, 35, and 42, one subsample of each sample was removed and extracted with KCl for 18 - 24 hours. The clarified KCl was filtered through a Kimwipe and analyzed on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer.Â  Statistical Analysis Fp: Extractable N at each time interval was averaged for the three soil samples from the 0.5 m^2 quadrats per plot to yield a mean value for each plot. The mean values then were used for statistical analysis (n=4). Bridges: The relative cover for under and open was obtained from the most recent bridge measurements (made within 2 weeks of soil collections). Extractable N in each soil sample was multiplied by the respective relative cover, and N conc.-times -cover values for soils collected at each bridge were summed to give a cover-weighted value for each bridge (n=5). The extractable N values for the four fp's were compared to the five bridges over the entire extraction period to determine differences between collection techniques (Factor 1), the effect of extraction time (Factor 2), and their interaction (Factor 1 X 2) at each time interval by analysis of variance. In addition, the variance associated with each collection method was determined and analyzed by analysis of variance to determine if the techniques significantly affected the variance associated with each technique. Results The two collection techniques were not significantly different for N mineralization (P = 0.47). There was no significant incubation time x collection technique interaction (P = 0.87). The bridge method did increase variance slightly, but not significantly (P = 0.114). Net N Mineralization Potentials by different Collection Techniques:FactorÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Â Â  d.f.

Organic matter was determined by loss-upon-ignition from oven-dried samples placed in a muffle furnace and brought to 500 degrees C for 2 hours. Soil Texture and Total N and P.At select times, texture (percent of sand, silt, and clay) was determined by the hydrometer method (Day, 1965). Total nitrogen and phosphorus were determined by Kjeldahl digestion with copper sulfate as catalyst (Schuman et al. 1973) followed by analysis of ammonium by an automated phenolate method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #19-69W) and orthophosphate by an ascorbic acid method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #94-70W).Water-holding capacityWater-holding capacity (WHC) was determine by saturating about a 50 g portion of the sieved soil contained in a funnel with DI water, allowing to saturate for 30 min., and then to drain by gravity for 30 min. The drained soil was transferred to pre-weighed soil tins and dried in an oven at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. The water lost upon drying was the water-holding capacity of the soil sample.Field available N and N mineralization/nitrification potentialsAfter determining water-holding capacity (WHC), a portion of each sample was adjusted to 500f determined WHC and subsamples were apportioned into plastic cups. Each cup contained approximately 30 g dry-weight mineral soil. One subsample of each sample was immediately extracted with 100 ml 2 N KCl (with 5 ppm phenyl mercuric acetate as a preservative) for NH4+-N and NO3--N analyses. The remainder of the cups were covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band, and incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C. The plastic wrap minimized water loss during incubation, yet exchange of CO2 and O2 was sufficient to keep the subsamples aerobic during incubation. Moisture content was monitored by mass loss and replenished as needed. At approximately weekly intervals, one subsample of each sample was removed, 100 ml KCl was added and shaken with the plastic wrap coveringthe top, and allowed to settle for 18-24 h. The clarified KCl was filtered through a Kimwipe and analyzed for NH4+-N and NO3--N+NO2--N on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer (Technicon, Terrytown, NY) as described in White (1986). This procedure gave up to three different measurements for inorganic ammonium and nitrate: The initial extractions (time 0, wetted but not incubated) indicated field available concentrations (their sum gave total field available N); The amount of ammonium and nitrate extracted after 35-day incubation; and The maximum sum of ammonium and nitrate in any extraction up to the 35-day incubation (some samples peaked prior to day 35)."

The mean values then were used for statistical analysis (n=4). Bridges: The relative cover for under and open was obtained from the most recent bridge measurements (made within 2 weeks of soil collections). Extractable N in each soil sample was multiplied by the respective relative cover, and N conc.-times -cover values for soils collected at each bridge were summed to give a cover-weighted value for each bridge (n=5).

In addition, the variance associated with each collection method was determined and analyzed by analysis of variance to determine if the techniques significantly affected the variance associated with each technique. Results The two collection techniques were not significantly different for N mineralization (P = 0.47). There was no significant incubation time x collection technique interaction (P = 0.87).

Organic matter was determined by loss-upon-ignition from oven-dried samples placed in a muffle furnace and brought to 500 degrees C for 2 hours. Soil Texture and Total N and P.At select times, texture (percent of sand, silt, and clay) was determined by the hydrometer method (Day, 1965). Total nitrogen and phosphorus were determined by Kjeldahl digestion with copper sulfate as catalyst (Schuman et al. 1973) followed by analysis of ammonium by an automated phenolate method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #19-69W) and orthophosphate by an ascorbic acid method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #94-70W).Water-holding capacityWater-holding capacity (WHC) was determine by saturating about a 50 g portion of the sieved soil contained in a funnel with DI water, allowing to saturate for 30 min., and then to drain by gravity for 30 min. The drained soil was transferred to pre-weighed soil tins and dried in an oven at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. The water lost upon drying was the water-holding capacity of the soil sample.Field available N and N mineralization/nitrification potentialsAfter determining water-holding capacity (WHC), a portion of each sample was adjusted to 500f determined WHC and subsamples were apportioned into plastic cups. Each cup contained approximately 30 g dry-weight mineral soil. One subsample of each sample was immediately extracted with 100 ml 2 N KCl (with 5 ppm phenyl mercuric acetate as a preservative) for NH4+-N and NO3--N analyses. The remainder of the cups were covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band, and incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C. The plastic wrap minimized water loss during incubation, yet exchange of CO2 and O2 was sufficient to keep the subsamples aerobic during incubation. Moisture content was monitored by mass loss and replenished as needed. At approximately weekly intervals, one subsample of each sample was removed, 100 ml KCl was added and shaken with the plastic wrap coveringthe top, and allowed to settle for 18-24 h. The clarified KCl was filtered through a Kimwipe and analyzed for NH4+-N and NO3--N+NO2--N on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer (Technicon, Terrytown, NY) as described in White (1986). This procedure gave up to three different measurements for inorganic ammonium and nitrate: The initial extractions (time 0, wetted but not incubated) indicated field available concentrations (their sum gave total field available N); The amount of ammonium and nitrate extracted after 35-day incubation; and The maximum sum of ammonium and nitrate in any extraction up to the 35-day incubation (some samples peaked prior to day 35)."

00029-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"SAMPLING DESIGN Samples are collected in acid-washed, deionized water-rinsed, polyethylene bottles, from a small waterfall above the stream gauging station, to avoid contamination from ponded debris or weir construction materials. The normal sampling interval is weekly, with more frequent samples taken at times of increased discharge. At low flow summer (drought) conditions, samples may be taken with a clean polyethylene syringe, from undisturbed standing pools in the stream channel. Daily export values (in g/ha-mo) are derived by multiplying daily streamflow amounts (in mm) for watershed 7, by the concentration of solutes (in mg/L) in the WS-7 sample taken on that day. For periods between samples, the average chemistry of the previous and next discrete sample is used for a daily concentration value. Measured and estimated daily values are summed to produce monthly export, and export divided by total monthly streamflow to produce volume-weighted, average monthly concentrations for streamwater at HBEF WS-7. In June 2013, after careful inter-laboratory comparisons, chemical analyses were transferred from the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies Lab to the USDA Forest Service Lab in Durham, NH. Samples are split into 3 aliquots for different analyses. Monomeric Aluminum is measured on an unfiltered-refrigerated aliquot using an automated Pyrocatechol Violet method. A filtered-refrigerated aliquot is acidified and analyzed for cations and metals using ICP-OES (USEPA 200.7). A filtered-frozen sample is used for measuring NH4 (USEPA 350.1 Rev. 2.0), PO4 (USEPA 365.1 Rev. 2.0), Anions (USEPA 300.1) , DOC (USEPA 450.1) and TDN (High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation with chemiluminescent N detection).

The normal sampling interval is weekly, with more frequent samples taken at times of increased discharge. At low flow summer (drought) conditions, samples may be taken with a clean polyethylene syringe, from undisturbed standing pools in the stream channel. Daily export values (in g/ha-mo) are derived by multiplying daily streamflow amounts (in mm) for watershed 7, by the concentration of solutes (in mg/L) in the WS-7 sample taken on that day. For periods between samples, the average chemistry of the previous and next discrete sample is used for a daily concentration value. Measured and estimated daily values are summed to produce monthly export, and export divided by total monthly streamflow to produce volume-weighted, average monthly concentrations for streamwater at HBEF WS-7.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00031-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Web trapping design: Experimental units were established in a 4 x 4 grid as part of a burn and antelope exclosure experiment. Small mammals were trapped in fireblocks 1, 2, 3, and 4. Each fireblock contains four webs, for a total of 16 webs. Small mammal densities are estimated from recapture data.Within each location four webs were established. Each web contains twelve 100m transects radiating from a central point in a spoke like fashion. Four 'Sherman' traps were placed around this central point. Twelve traps are placed along each of the radiating lines, the first four are placed at 5m intervals, and the remaining eight placed at 10m intervals. Rebar were used to mark the location of trap placement. Each rebar was tagged with a number from 1 to 145, with trap number 1 at the north facing spoke and radiating out to trap number 12, with each spoke following with successive numbers increasing in a clockwise fashion. Trap number 145 includes the four traps placed in the center of the web. Traps were placed adjacent to rebar unless a shaded area could be found within a meter or so along an arc of equal radius from the center. The webs are separated by distances from approx. 100m to 600m. Within each fireblock, each web is marked with a number from 1-4.Trapping times:Each summer was divided into two periods: period 1 and period 2.Mammals were trapped as follows:1991: period 1: NAÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  period 2: September 4 - October 41992: period 1: April 15 - May 8Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  period 2: August 4 - September 171993: period 1: April 6 - 29Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  period 2: September ??Each location was trapped in the same order for each period.The order is as follows:1. Fireblock 12. Fireblock 23. Fireblock 34. Fireblock 4Each trapping session consisted of placing and baiting traps on Monday, then checking the traps at dawn on both Tuesday (night 1), Wednesday (night 2), and Thursday (night 3). The traps were collected on Thursday after being checked for animals. A small handful of rolled oats was placed into each trap, with small amounts placed outside trap door. Animals were removed form closed traps with the aid of plastic bags. They were then identified to species. Weight was determined to the nearest gram using a pesola scale. Body, tail, foot, and ear measurements were taken for Peromyscus. Body and tail measurements were taken for Onychomys, Perognathus, and Reithrodomtomys. All measurments were taken to the nearest millimeter using a plastic ruler. Reproductive status was determined by examination of the genitalia. The animal was also sexed, aged, and marked. Marking was done to each animal on the first nights capture for each individual animal. Data Entry1. Data were entered at Biology Annex using data entry program 'mammal-entry'2. Data were checked for errors by comparing original data sheets with the data entered into the computer.3. After all errors were corrected, a dbf file was created using a Sun machine. (/research/local/mammal/bin/SASmam2dbf filename &gt; filename.dbf) This modifies the comments, leaving out comments noted as 'na'.4. A rdb file was then created using 'arc2rdb filename.dbf &gt; filename.rdb'.5. The rdb file was then checked for errors using 'check &lt; filename.rdb'.6. After errors were corrected, the rdb file was sorted using 'sort filename | uniq -c | page' to check that every entry was unique.7. Duplications were investigated and corrected.8. Dbf and rdb files were then copied to /research/archive/dbwork/vertebrate/ mammal/burnplot9.

The local terrain at both sites is flat or gently sloping Sonoran desert, and the vegetation canopy consists of patchy coverage of desert shrubs and trees. The dominant vegetation species include bursage (Ambrosia deltoidea) and creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), while minor species include palo verde (Parkinsonia microphylla) and saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea). Wind speed and direction, incoming solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation (see table below) have been monitored nearly continuously since the fall of 2010. Each variable is measured every 5 seconds and the average (or total for precipitation and total solar radiation) is saved to a data logger every 10 minutes."

00032-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"introduction: two meteorological measurement stations have been installed in the Central Arizona-Phoenix area. The first station is located at the Lost Dutchman State Park (LDP) in Goldfield, Arizona. This station used an existing tower and was instrumented with new sensors, datalogger, and power system in May 2006. The second station is located at the Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) in Phoenix, Arizona. A new tower was mounted on a concrete pad south of the DBG trails and new sensors were installed in October 2006. These stations have been used to collect meteorological measurements that are inputs to gas and particle dry deposition models. This manual is intended to document the installation, operation, and maintenance procedures for the LDP and DBG meteorological measurement stations. More detailed information can be found in the Campbell Scientific manuals for each product (http: //www.campbellsci.com). site descriptions: the Lost Dutchman State Park (LDP) meteorological station is approximately 55 km east of downtown Phoenix, Arizona, at the base of the Superstition Mountains to the north and east, and bordered by desert and low density residential land to the south and west. The Desert Botanical Garden (DBG) meteorological station is approximately 12 km east of downtown Phoenix, within the city of Phoenix and surrounded by urban industrial, residential, and recreational land. The vegetation canopy at both sites consists of patchy coverage of desert shrubs and trees. measurement sensors: The towers are equipped with sensors to measure wind speed, wind direction, incoming solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. A timestamp and record number saved by the datalogger for each measurement. Each variable is measured every 5 seconds and the average (or total for precipitation and total solar radiation) is saved to the datalogger every ten minutes. maintenance: proper maintenance of the weather station is essential to obtaining valid data. A regular program of inspection and maintenance ensures that equipment is in good operating condition. Calibration, sensor testing, and sensor repairs are done by Campbell Scientific. The maintenance and calibration schedule for the towers and sensors is as follows: tower, enclosure, wiring, and mounting hardware: check for damage during each site visit; replace sensor cables as necessary. Pyranometer: check the level and clean the sensor head at each visit (weekly is recommended by Campbell); calibrate annually. Rain gage: clean the funnel and level the gage monthly; calibrate annually. Anemometer: visually inspect the propeller and wind vane for smooth motion monthly. Temperature/RH Probe: check the filter and radiation shield for contamination monthly; clean semiannually; calibrate annually. Solar Panel: clean the glass semi-annually (or more frequently if it becomes dirty). data collection: data are downloaded manually at approximately 6-month intervals"

00033-metadata.xml,Maintenance,/eml:eml/dataset/maintenance,"Â On September 6, 1999, the data manager added the 1998-1999 data to this dataset. In the process,she did some fine-tuning of the data, which included: Â  Â  Â  Â  1. Addition of Â PAR values between Nov 24, 1997 @ 11:30 and Jan 13, 1998 @ 12:00. Thiswas done at the request of Thomas Nylen. Â  Â  Â  Â  On June 1, 2000, the 1999-2000 data was posted. In the process, Denise Â Steigerwald changed thelayout of the files so that they were sorted by category (ait temperatures, humidity, radiation,wind etc.) rather than by year. Files containing monthly and daily averages were generated andminor adjustments were made to the metadata. Â  Â On June 1, 2000, relative humidity (RH) values were corrected for a systematic error in the measurement created by an instrument manufacturer error. All RH data with air temperatures below freezing Â were corrected using the vapor pressure over ice (rather than over water whichwas used initially). The error became quite large for very cold temperatures (the correction couldgrow to around 30%). The formula used for the correction was: Â  Â  Â  Â  Â RH_corr=RH_orig/((A*temp*temp)+(B*temp)+C) whereÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â RH_corr = corrected relative humidity Â  Â  Â  Â RH_orig = original relative humidityÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â temp = air temperatureÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â A = 4.165E-5 Â  Â  Â  Â B = 9.7E-3 Â  Â  Â  Â C = 1.0 Â  Â For example, with an air temperature of -2.3 and RH_orig of 50.6, the RH_corr will be Â 51.7.Records that showed corrected RH values greater than or equal to 100 were changed to 99.99and flagged. Â  Â  Â Â  Â In June 2000, summary files were added to the web containing daily and monthly statistics.These were generated by creating 'views' of daily and monthly means, Â minimums, maximumsand counts of the records represented in the Oracle database's meteorology tables."

00034-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"LOCATION DESCRIPTION These data were collected at on 373 plots in the valleywide plot network located at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. SAMPLING DESIGN Each transect point was surveyed three times per year. The starting point and path among points differed for each of the three replicates to minimize the effects of visitation path on time of surveying. First round: valley bottom to ridge. Second round: Ridge to valley bottom. Third Round: mix of valley bottom to ridge and vice-versa. The survey began at 05:30 and was completed before 10:00. A 10 minute survey was conducted at each station, commencing 1 minute after arrival at a point. Surveys were conducted under satisfactory weather conditions: good visibility, little or no precipitation, light winds. Birds were recorded at two distances: within 50 meters and at 50 – 100 meters. The species of all birds seen and heard were recorded as well as all individual squirrels and chipmunks seen and heard. The 10-minute count was divided into 3 equal intervals (3 minutes, 20 seconds). Periods were numbered as: 1=0–3:20 min, 2=3:21–6:40 min, 3=6:41–10:00min. Each period was treated as a separate count (i.e., Individuals in the later periods were counted even if they were detected in period 1). New.Record indicates a detection is new for the complete 10-minute count; for example if an individual is detected in the second period and was also detected in the first it received a 0. If it appears for the first time in the second period, it receives a 1. If an individual moves from the outer distance circle (50-100 m) to the 50 m circle during the count, this individual should be marked with a 1 in the New.Record column. If two male birds were detected simultaneously within 100 m at a count, both individuals received a 1 in the Counter.sing column. These data are critical in that they allow comparison with the point count method prior to 2006."

00035-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Permanent plots are a powerful tool for understanding systems over the long term because of the rigorous quantification of patterns in a spatially refined way and because of the comparability of numerous variables measured in the same place. In 1998, 7 plots were surveyed into 3 forests in the study region of the Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES): Oregon Ridge Park (4 plots), Hillsdale Park (1 plot), and Leakin Park (2 plots). In 2003, the same seven plots were re-surveyed and one in Hillsdale Park was added, for a total of eight plots. Plots were surveyed in order to correct for slope and to achieve an accuracy of plot side length to within 0.5 cm. Plots are 1600 m2 with the exception of the Hillsdale plots which are 900 m2. The Hillsdale plots are smaller to fit within the confines of the forest patch. Sites were selected 1) to represent urban and non-urban forests, 2) away from obvious habitat boundaries or edges, 3) with consistent drainage lines within the plot, and 4) with at least 80 % continuous tree canopy. All vegetation layers were sampled in order to characterize the structure and composition of the plant community. A variety of sampling methods were used for the different layers but all layers were quantified with a high level of detail to minimize variation and to best characterize the plot."

00036-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Patterns of biodiversity, such as the increase toward the tropics and the peaked curve during ecological succession, are fundamental phenomena for ecology. Such patterns have multiple, interacting causes, but temperature emerges as a dominant factor across organisms from microbes to trees and mammals, and across terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments. However, there is little consensus on the underlying mechanisms, even as global temperatures increase and the need to predict their effects becomes more pressing. The purpose of this project is to generate and test theory for how temperature impacts biodiversity through its effect on biochemical processes and metabolic rate. A combination of standardized surveys in the field and controlled experiments in the field and laboratory measure diversity of three taxa -- trees, invertebrates, and microbes -- and key biogeochemical processes of decomposition in seven forests distributed along a geographic gradient of increasing temperature from cold temperate to warm tropical. This dataset contains dendrometer data for trees in the five Gentry subplots at each experimental site. These plots were installed by the Enquist Lab and the University of Arizona as part of this macrosystems biodiversity and latitude project supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement DEB#1065836."

00037-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Color is measured four times a year in the seven northern study lakes (Allequash, Big Muskellunge, Crystal, Sparkling, and Trout lakes, unnamed lakes 27-02 [Crystal Bog] and 12-15 [Trout Bog]) in water samples that are filtered in the field through 0.45 um nucleopore membrane filters. A spectrophotometer is used to quantify color in the lab as absorbance (unitless) at 1 nm intervals between the wavelengths of 200 and 800 nm (Note: Prior to August 2008, samples were initially run in 10cm cuvettes. Starting in Aug 2008, samples are initially run in 5cm cuvettes. Absorbance data are considered suspect for values greater than 2. Lakes with suspect data (typically, the bog lakes) are re-analyzed in the 200-400 nm range in 1 cm cuvettes. The data values are linear with respect to cuvette size. I.e, data from the 1cm cuvettes should be multiplied by 5 to be comparable with 5cm cuvette data and multiplied by 10 to be comparable with 10cm cuvette data. Data from 5cm cuvettes should be multiplied by 2 to be comparable with the older 10cm cuvette data. Sampling Frequency: 4 times annually Number of sites: 7"

The samples are surface water, filtered in the field through 0.45u polycarbonate membrane filters. We run a wavelength scan from 800 to 200nm, using a 5cm rectangular quartz cell in a Beckman Coulter Model DU800 spectrophotometer. Any samples that display absorbance values above 2AU are run again from 400 to 200nm using a 1cm quartz cuvette. Inititally the full range of wavelengths were run again and two values may be found in the database even if the original measurement with the large cuvette did not exceed 2AU. The user should discard values above 2AU and use values from the smaller cuvette instead. All values are given as measurements at the path lenth of the employed cuvette and need to be devided by the cuvette length for a comparable value at a pathlength of 1 cm. The single beam Beckman Coulter DU800 spec is blanked first on a sample of DI water. Additional blank values are from a scan run on DI after that blanking as a check and are reported alongside the scans but are not subtracted from the scan values. Protocol Log: 1990 -- we began running color scans, using a 10cm cylindrical cell with a Kontron spectrophotometer. 2001 -- we added scans in a 1cm cell for samples with high absorbance. July 2008 -- changed to Beckman Coulter DU800 spectrophotometer. At same time changed from 10cm to 5cm cell."

These are placed in plastic bag and kept under refrigeration until samples are tested. Two to three samples with a fresh weight of 2 g are removed from each tissue type. These are placed in serum tubes, capped, and incubated at 15°C for 1-2 hours with lab air to determine the respiration rate. The tubes are then purged for 2 minutes with argon, acetylene is injected, and air is injected to give 1% oxygen. Incubations for acetylene reduction are at 15°C for 20-25 hours. Carbon dioxide and ethylene production are measured using a gas chromatograph. Moisture content is calculated after drying the samples 2 days at 70°C. Site 1: elevation is 1065m, average annual temperature 8.9 degree C, average annual precipitation is 229cm. Site 4: elevation is 865m, average annual temperature 9.9 degree C, average annual precipitation is 219cm Sampling frequency: irregular The data are a time series, basically on an annual time step. Regression analysis will be used to test if the rates for species and tissue types changes with time. During any one time the design varies from a split-split plot to a split plot ANOVA.

Andrews Experimental Forest; PO Box 300 Blue River OR 97413 541-822-6336 mark.schulze@oregonstate.edu Principal Investigator The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics. Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources. Data were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest research program, funded by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 08-23380), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and Oregon State University. National Science Foundation: DEB0823380 The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms."

Andrews Experimental Forest; PO Box 300 Blue River OR 97413 541-822-6336 mark.schulze@oregonstate.edu Principal Investigator The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics. Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources. Data were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest research program, funded by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 08-23380), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and Oregon State University. National Science Foundation: DEB0823380 The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms."

00039-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In 1995, a removal study was initiated at the Sevilleta LTER to examine the response of vegetation following the removal of dominant species. Five sites were selected that were dominated by either blue grama (site 1), blue and black grama (site 2), black grama (site 3), black grama and creosote (site 4), or creosote (site 5). A sixth site was later added in the blue grama community along the foothills of the Los Pinos Mountains (site 6). At sites 1, 3, 5, and 6, five 3m x 4m plots had all plants of the dominant species removed; five 3m x 4m plots were controls. At site 2, 5 plots had blue grama removed, 5 plots had black grama removed, and 5 plots were controls. At site 4, 5 plots had black grama removed, 5 plots had creosote removed, and 5 plots were controls. Initial cover prior to removal was estimated by species for each plot. Grass was removed using a shovel to collect above-ground biomass and crowns just below the soil surface. Shrubs were removed using large clippers to collect above-ground biomass to the soil surface. All biomass removed was bagged, dried, and weighed. Plot maintenance or removal of the target dominant species is performed annually or as needed. Rain gauges were installed at each site and the corners of the areas containing each set of plots GPS'd. Plot corners are marked by nails and are flagged periodically to aid identification and minimize foot traffic in the plots. Each northeast nail has a metal tag with site and plot number on it. Erosion bridges (1 m long) were installed in plots 1, 3 and 5 (removals and controls) at sites 1-5. Initial measurements were made in 1996."

Data are entered onto a palmtop using the pre-formatted spreadsheet for ease of entry and transfer to a PC. The procedure is as follows: 1. Locate the metal tag on the northeastern nail and enter the site and plot code into the palmtop. 2. Depending on the treatment, certain species may need to be removed in and around the plot. The removal codes are as follows: RU-Remove BOGR2, RA-Remove BOER4, and RC-Remove LATR2. Do not remove plants from the control (C) and total removal (TR) plots. 3. Thoroughly search each plot and record every species present. This is ideally done by 1-2 people, but a single observer is sufficient. 4. The percent canopy cover of each species in the plot is estimated visually using the following numerical ranges: T = &lt; 0.1% 0.1-0.9% by intervals of 0.1% 1-5% by intervals of 0.5% 5-20% by intervals of 1.0% 20-100% by intervals of 5.0% Cover is estimated for all species as well as litter. Bare ground is calculated by subtracting the total cover of all species from 100%. Cover of less than 0.1% is recorded in the data as 'T' (i.e., trace). It is advisable to re-flag plot corners and perform plot maintenance prior to assessing cover. To maintain the plots, clip any species to be removed from the edges and middle of the plot. Do not re-clip anything from the total removal plots. Laboratory procedures: Biomass removed from plots is dried, sorted by live and dead material, and weighed.

Both available N and potentially mineralizable N were greatest following a drought period in 1989, declined during wetter periods that followed and remained relatively stable until another extended drought period. After drought in 1995-6, both forms of soil N increased, indicating the potential for greater NPP following drought and lower potential NPP during periods of normal precipitation."

00040-metadata.xml,Purpose,/eml:eml/dataset/purpose,"This project began as part of a study to identify the interactions between soil inorganic nitrogen supply and El Nino-La Nina oscillations that bring wetter-than-average or drier-than-average (respectively) winter-spring precipitation to the central New Mexico region (El Nino-La Nina Fertilization Experiment). This project was known locally as 'The Fertilizer Study' and was initiated by Dr. Sandra Turner. To test whether soil inorganic N was limiting aboveground net primary production, fertilizer was added to designated plots within a block of study plots. At first, the soil sampling was designed to confirm or establish the actual fertilizer contribution to each site. The amount added was the amount of inorganic N in soils from the fertilized plots minus that in the control plots. The amount in the controls plots was interpreted as being the amount of inorganic N that had not been utilized by the plant/microbial community and was 'available' at that time for utilization in the future. Potentially mineralizable N measurements were performed to determine how the amount of readily mineralizable N was changed by the fertilizer addition; termed a priming effect when the addition of inorganic N results in even greater increases in mineralizable N. Early results from this study were reported at the 1990 Ecological Society of America annual meetings (White et al. 1990). Following the first year's work, measurements of soil available N and potentially mineralizable N were continued. Except in 1990 when a computer hard-drive that contained most of that year's soil N data crashed and the data were not able to be recovered, the period from 1989 until the spring- summer of 1999 was covered by at least one collection per year."
00040-metadata.xml,Supplemental Information,/eml:eml/dataset/additionalInfo,"Additional Information on the Data Collection Period Data collected four times per year (usually January, April, July and October). Sampled one week per season, four seasons per year. Site DescriptionThe fertilizer study was initiated at two locations on the Sevilleta NWR; one on the east side and one on the west side of the refuge. The east side study site was located within a 300m by 300m block on MacKenzie Flats. The vegetation was dominated by black grama and was thought to be a 'typical' black grama desert-grassland. Within that area were 100 ea. 30m by 30m plots (10 plots along the side). The outer 2.5 m of the plot were left as a buffer strip, so the inside 25m by 25m plot constituted the actual sampling unit. When the fertilizer study was no longer active, the plots were sampled to continue the long-term soil record. In 1995, 5 locations along the east 300 m border of the fertilizer study area were established for future soil monitoring. Each of these new sites had soil erosion bridges installed to measure changes in soil microtopography (erosion/deposition). In the methods section are the results of a study that verified that sampling at the 5 new locations gave results comparable to those from the 4 random plots within the fertilizer study area. In 2003, the 5 new locations of 1995 were burned by prescribed fire on 19 June 2003. Additional bridge and soil sites were established within the original fertilizer study area (established in control or untreated plots) and sampled before the prescribed fire to establish similarities to continue the control or untreated soil collections at that area. These new bridge sites are numbered 7196, 7197, 7198, 7199, and 7200.The original study also had a grassland site on the west side of the Sevilleta NWR. This site was west of the Field Station, accessed by entrance at the north gate near Bernardo and following the roadbed of the old highway alignment. This site was dominated by C-3 grasses with C-4 grasses a minor component. Shrubs were primarily 4-wing saltbush. The west side only had room for 61 each 30m by 30m plots. When the fertilizer study was ceased, no further soil collections were made on the west side for long-term study. Method ReferencesDay, Paul R. 1965.

00040-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Each 30m by 30m plot was given a number at the beginning of the study. Before each year's fertilizer application or collection, plots were chosen by selection of random numbers from a table or by using a phone book and using the last 2 digits of the phone numbers. Plots that were used in prior years were excluded from future use. The outer 2.5 m of each plot were left as a buffer strip, so the inside 25m by 25m plot constituted the actual sampling unit.It is not known if the fertilizer was applied to the 30 x 30 m plot or only to the 25 x 25 m plot excluding the buffer. Thus, values given below are based upon application to the 30 x 30 m plot and should be used cautiously. 1989 Protocols In 1989, fertilizer treatments were applied as NH4NO3 in 2 treatment levels with controls (low, high, and no fertilizer). Three plots received 61.8 kg N/ha, three plots received 30.9 kg N/ha, and 3 plots were not fertilized (controls). All of these plots were selected in a random manner. It turned out that plot 7 on the west side was too disturbed to be used, so plot 51 was substituted. On the east side, plot 66 was mistakenly fertilized instead of plot 56, which had been selected, so that plot 66 became the 3rd heavily fertilized plot. Hence the plots used in their respective treatments were as follows: Treatments Â  East sideÂ Â Â  West side ----------Â Â  Â  Â  ----------Â Â Â  ---------- ControlÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  16, 33, 42Â Â Â  16, 33, 42 LowÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  7, 10, 25Â Â Â  19, 25, 51 HighÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1, 26, 66Â Â Â Â  1, 26, 56 The fertilizer was applied in April on the east and west sides. Fertilizer was applied with a cyclone spreader by a person walking 5 equally spaced paths across each plot while cranking the spreader. The light treatment was applied with passes in only one direction, while passes were made in both directions across the plot for the heavy treatments. Soil samples were collected on April 18, 1989, to verify the nitrogen additions and to measure net N mineralization and nitrification potentials. Soil cores (4.2 mm in diameter) were taken to a depth of 20 cm at 4 m intervals along a diagonal from the NE to the SW corner of the plot (starting at the edge of the 2.5 m buffer zone). These cores (15 in all) were placed in the same bag and comprised one sample. The 3 plots represented the sample units (n=3). Plot 66 was not collected until July 4th, when the mistake was identified because plot 56 had no elevated levels of nitrate or ammonium. 1990 Protocols In 1990, it was decided that the number of treatment levels would be reduced to one fertilizer application rate and that the number of replicate treatment plots be increased to 4. Fertilizer was applied in two applications, instead of the single application in 1989, in attempts to reduce 'burning' from the fertilizer. The first application was on March 1, 1990, and the second was April 4, 1990. Over an inch of rain occurred on both the east and west sides between applications. For each application, fertilizer was applied with a cyclone spreader by a person walking 3 evenly spaced passes across each plot in one direction, and then repeating the process in the perpendicular direction. The setting on the cyclone spreader was 3 1/4. The plots used were: Treatments Â  Â  East sideÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  West side ----------Â Â Â Â Â  -------------- Â  Â Â  -------------- ControlÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  24, 34, 43, 48 Â Â  24, 34, 43, 48 HighÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3, 22, 30, 60Â Â Â Â  3, 22, 30, 60 Within each 30m by 30m plot, 3 ea. half-meter-square (1/2 or 0.5 m^2) quadrats were randomly selected for soil sampling within the northwest quarter of the plot (the 12.5 m by 12.5 m portion excluding the 2.5 m buffer). To identify the location of the 0.5 m^2 quadrats, two tape measures were run parallel to each other, one along the top of the plot and the second along the mid-line of the NW quarter. A third tape was run between the two tapes on the edges to locate the long side of the randomly selected 0.5 m^2 quadrats. Along each diagonal, 4 soil cores were taken at equal spacing starting with the corner of the quadrat and ending in the diagonal corner. Soil cores (4.2 mm diameter) were taken to a depth of 20 cm. The 4 cores from the quadrat were placed in the same bag and comprised one sample. Thus, each plot had 3 soil samples, one from each quadrat, with each treatment having 4 plots. Protocols for 1991 through 1994 Starting in 1991 and continuing through 1994, 4 plots were sampled with 3 quadrats in each plot; however, only three soil cores were collected (2 from the opposing corners and one from the middle of the quadrat) per quadrat. As in the other years (except 1989 where only one sample was taken per plot), soils from each quadrat were analyzed separately and later averaged to get the value for the plot (3 replicate soil analyses, one per quadrat, and these values were averaged to get a plot value for each of 4 plots; n=4). Protocols for 1995 to present: Soil Bridges and associated soil collections In 1995, 5 soil bridges were installed about 30 m east of the Fertilizer Plots. The primary function of the soil bridge is to measure small changes in soil microtopography; erosion or deposition. At the time of soil bridge measurements, two soil cores (same dimensions, 4.2 mm diameter to a depth of 20 cm) for initial available N and potentially mineralizable N were collected from vegetated (mostly grass, 2 cores each) and unvegetated (2 cores each) areas that appeared comparable to those areas beneath the soil bridge. The two sample-types (under plants or open soils) were analyzed separately and the 'average' for the bridge was determined by weighting the soil- types by their respective coverages determined beneath the bridge. For example, if vegetation cover was 35% (0.35 of area beneath the bridge had vegetation) and bare soil 65%, the N values for the soil beneath the vegetation were multiplied by 0.35 and summed with the N values for the bare soils multiplied by 0.65. This procedure gave 5 average values for soil N at each collection.+ In the summer of 1998, a study was performed to make direct comparison of the two different collection techniques (collection of soils from fertilizer plots or soils associated with the bridges) and the potential differences the collection method could have on soil nitrogen mineralization potentials. Methods used for comparative study Collection on fertilizer plots (fp): Four plots were randomly selected as per previous methods; 4 each 30 X 30 m plots within a 300 X 300 m study site. Within each plot, three randomly selected 0.5 m^2 quadrats within the 15 X 15 m NW quarter of the plot were selected. Within each 0.5 m^2 quadrat, a soil core (4 cm diameter by 20 cm long) was taken from the NW and SE corners of the plot. Both cores were composited to make one sample from each quadrat. This sampling method gave 3 soil samples for each of four plots, for a total of 12 samples. Collection from the bridge sites: The 5 bridges were equally spaced along the 300 m east border of the fp study area. At each bridge, 2 soil sample cores (4 cm diameter by 20 cm long) were taken from under vegetation cover (under) and 2 from non-vegetative soil surfaces (open). The two cores were composited to give a single soil sample from under and open at each bridge. Analyses of N mineralization potentials: After determining the water holding capacity (WHC; White and McDonnell 1988), a portion of each sample was adjusted to 50% of determined WHC and 5 subsamples were apportioned into plastic cups. Each cup contained approximately 30 g (+/- 0.05 g) dry-weight mineral soil. One subsample of each sample was immediately extracted with 100 ml 2 N KCl for NH4+-N and NO3--N analyses. The remainder of the cups were covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band and incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C. Moisture content was monitored by mass loss and replenished as needed. At days 14, 28, 35, and 42, one subsample of each sample was removed and extracted with KCl for 18 - 24 hours. The clarified KCl was filtered through a Kimwipe and analyzed on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer.Â  Statistical Analysis Fp: Extractable N at each time interval was averaged for the three soil samples from the 0.5 m^2 quadrats per plot to yield a mean value for each plot. The mean values then were used for statistical analysis (n=4). Bridges: The relative cover for under and open was obtained from the most recent bridge measurements (made within 2 weeks of soil collections). Extractable N in each soil sample was multiplied by the respective relative cover, and N conc.-times -cover values for soils collected at each bridge were summed to give a cover-weighted value for each bridge (n=5). The extractable N values for the four fp's were compared to the five bridges over the entire extraction period to determine differences between collection techniques (Factor 1), the effect of extraction time (Factor 2), and their interaction (Factor 1 X 2) at each time interval by analysis of variance. In addition, the variance associated with each collection method was determined and analyzed by analysis of variance to determine if the techniques significantly affected the variance associated with each technique. Results The two collection techniques were not significantly different for N mineralization (P = 0.47). There was no significant incubation time x collection technique interaction (P = 0.87). The bridge method did increase variance slightly, but not significantly (P = 0.114). Net N Mineralization Potentials by different Collection Techniques:FactorÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Â Â  d.f.

Organic matter was determined by loss-upon-ignition from oven-dried samples placed in a muffle furnace and brought to 500 degrees C for 2 hours. Soil Texture and Total N and P.At select times, texture (percent of sand, silt, and clay) was determined by the hydrometer method (Day, 1965). Total nitrogen and phosphorus were determined by Kjeldahl digestion with copper sulfate as catalyst (Schuman et al. 1973) followed by analysis of ammonium by an automated phenolate method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #19-69W) and orthophosphate by an ascorbic acid method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #94-70W).Water-holding capacityWater-holding capacity (WHC) was determine by saturating about a 50 g portion of the sieved soil contained in a funnel with DI water, allowing to saturate for 30 min., and then to drain by gravity for 30 min. The drained soil was transferred to pre-weighed soil tins and dried in an oven at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. The water lost upon drying was the water-holding capacity of the soil sample.Field available N and N mineralization/nitrification potentialsAfter determining water-holding capacity (WHC), a portion of each sample was adjusted to 500f determined WHC and subsamples were apportioned into plastic cups. Each cup contained approximately 30 g dry-weight mineral soil. One subsample of each sample was immediately extracted with 100 ml 2 N KCl (with 5 ppm phenyl mercuric acetate as a preservative) for NH4+-N and NO3--N analyses. The remainder of the cups were covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band, and incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C. The plastic wrap minimized water loss during incubation, yet exchange of CO2 and O2 was sufficient to keep the subsamples aerobic during incubation. Moisture content was monitored by mass loss and replenished as needed. At approximately weekly intervals, one subsample of each sample was removed, 100 ml KCl was added and shaken with the plastic wrap coveringthe top, and allowed to settle for 18-24 h. The clarified KCl was filtered through a Kimwipe and analyzed for NH4+-N and NO3--N+NO2--N on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer (Technicon, Terrytown, NY) as described in White (1986). This procedure gave up to three different measurements for inorganic ammonium and nitrate: The initial extractions (time 0, wetted but not incubated) indicated field available concentrations (their sum gave total field available N); The amount of ammonium and nitrate extracted after 35-day incubation; and The maximum sum of ammonium and nitrate in any extraction up to the 35-day incubation (some samples peaked prior to day 35)."

The remainder of the cups were covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band and incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C. Moisture content was monitored by mass loss and replenished as needed. At days 14, 28, 35, and 42, one subsample of each sample was removed and extracted with KCl for 18 - 24 hours. The clarified KCl was filtered through a Kimwipe and analyzed on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer.Â  Statistical Analysis Fp: Extractable N at each time interval was averaged for the three soil samples from the 0.5 m^2 quadrats per plot to yield a mean value for each plot. The mean values then were used for statistical analysis (n=4). Bridges: The relative cover for under and open was obtained from the most recent bridge measurements (made within 2 weeks of soil collections). Extractable N in each soil sample was multiplied by the respective relative cover, and N conc.-times -cover values for soils collected at each bridge were summed to give a cover-weighted value for each bridge (n=5). The extractable N values for the four fp's were compared to the five bridges over the entire extraction period to determine differences between collection techniques (Factor 1), the effect of extraction time (Factor 2), and their interaction (Factor 1 X 2) at each time interval by analysis of variance. In addition, the variance associated with each collection method was determined and analyzed by analysis of variance to determine if the techniques significantly affected the variance associated with each technique. Results The two collection techniques were not significantly different for N mineralization (P = 0.47). There was no significant incubation time x collection technique interaction (P = 0.87). The bridge method did increase variance slightly, but not significantly (P = 0.114). Net N Mineralization Potentials by different Collection Techniques:FactorÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Â Â  d.f.

Organic matter was determined by loss-upon-ignition from oven-dried samples placed in a muffle furnace and brought to 500 degrees C for 2 hours. Soil Texture and Total N and P.At select times, texture (percent of sand, silt, and clay) was determined by the hydrometer method (Day, 1965). Total nitrogen and phosphorus were determined by Kjeldahl digestion with copper sulfate as catalyst (Schuman et al. 1973) followed by analysis of ammonium by an automated phenolate method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #19-69W) and orthophosphate by an ascorbic acid method (Technicon AutoAnalyzer Industrial Method #94-70W).Water-holding capacityWater-holding capacity (WHC) was determine by saturating about a 50 g portion of the sieved soil contained in a funnel with DI water, allowing to saturate for 30 min., and then to drain by gravity for 30 min. The drained soil was transferred to pre-weighed soil tins and dried in an oven at 105 degrees C for 24 hours. The water lost upon drying was the water-holding capacity of the soil sample.Field available N and N mineralization/nitrification potentialsAfter determining water-holding capacity (WHC), a portion of each sample was adjusted to 500f determined WHC and subsamples were apportioned into plastic cups. Each cup contained approximately 30 g dry-weight mineral soil. One subsample of each sample was immediately extracted with 100 ml 2 N KCl (with 5 ppm phenyl mercuric acetate as a preservative) for NH4+-N and NO3--N analyses. The remainder of the cups were covered with plastic wrap, sealed with a rubber band, and incubated in the dark at 20 degrees C. The plastic wrap minimized water loss during incubation, yet exchange of CO2 and O2 was sufficient to keep the subsamples aerobic during incubation. Moisture content was monitored by mass loss and replenished as needed. At approximately weekly intervals, one subsample of each sample was removed, 100 ml KCl was added and shaken with the plastic wrap coveringthe top, and allowed to settle for 18-24 h. The clarified KCl was filtered through a Kimwipe and analyzed for NH4+-N and NO3--N+NO2--N on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer (Technicon, Terrytown, NY) as described in White (1986). This procedure gave up to three different measurements for inorganic ammonium and nitrate: The initial extractions (time 0, wetted but not incubated) indicated field available concentrations (their sum gave total field available N); The amount of ammonium and nitrate extracted after 35-day incubation; and The maximum sum of ammonium and nitrate in any extraction up to the 35-day incubation (some samples peaked prior to day 35)."

These slides will be analyzed by size class and major taxon (diatoms, dinoflagellates, etc.) with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a fully motorized stage and Apotome imaging workstation for automated processing, 3-D reconstruction and extended-field focus. Microplankton samples (500 mL; glutaraldehyde and acid Lugols preserved) will be enumerated and sized with the Zeiss Axiovert system (inverted DIC mode) or with a newly acquired Flow Cytometer And Microscope (FlowCAM) system (Sieracki et al. 1998). Particle silhouettes are acquired in the FlowCAM’s optical sensing volume using frame-grabbing technology. Imaging software then estimates equivalent spherical diameters (ESD) and normalized particle size distributions (log ESD vs. log size; ~1000 particles/analysis). For each plankton group or size category, measured biovolumes will be converted to cellular C using the equations of Verity et al. (1992) and Menden-Deur & Lessard (2000).

00041-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"General Methods Samples for nanoplankton analyses (20-50 mL) will be preserved (2 mL, 10% paraformaldehyde), stained with the fluorochromes proflavin (25 µL, 0.033% w/v) and DAPI (50 µg mL-1), filtered onto 0.8-µm black polycarbonate filters, and mounted onto glass slides. These slides will be analyzed by size class and major taxon (diatoms, dinoflagellates, etc.) with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a fully motorized stage and Apotome imaging workstation for automated processing, 3-D reconstruction and extended-field focus. Microplankton samples (500 mL; glutaraldehyde and acid Lugols preserved) will be enumerated and sized with the Zeiss Axiovert system (inverted DIC mode) or with a newly acquired Flow Cytometer And Microscope (FlowCAM) system (Sieracki et al. 1998). Particle silhouettes are acquired in the FlowCAM’s optical sensing volume using frame-grabbing technology. Imaging software then estimates equivalent spherical diameters (ESD) and normalized particle size distributions (log ESD vs. log size; ~1000 particles/analysis). For each plankton group or size category, measured biovolumes will be converted to cellular C using the equations of Verity et al. (1992) and Menden-Deur & Lessard (2000).

00043-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Climate change has resulted in major changes in the phenology of some species but not others. Long-term field observational records provide the best assessment of these changes, but geographic and taxonomic biases limit their utility. Plant specimens in herbaria have been hypothesized to provide a wealth of additional data for studying phenological responses to climatic change. However, no study to our knowledge has comprehensively addressed whether herbarium data are accurate measures of phenological response, and thus applicable to addressing such questions. We compared flowering phenology determined from field observations (years 1852-1858; 1875; 1878-1908; 2003-2006; 2011-2013) and herbarium records (1852-2013) of 20 species from New England, USA. Earliest flowering date estimated from herbarium records faithfully reflected field observations of first flowering date and substantially increased the sampling range across climatic conditions. Additionally, although most species demonstrated a response to inter-annual temperature variation, long-term temporal changes in phenological response were not detectable. Our findings support the use of herbarium records for understanding plant phenological responses to changes in temperature, and also importantly establish a new use of herbarium collections: inferring primary phenological cueing mechanisms of individual species (e.g., temperature, winter chilling, photoperiod). These latter data are lacking from most investigations of phenological change, but are vital for understanding differential responses of individual species to ongoing climate change."

00045-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"During the 1994-1995 field season, the Lake Vanda meteorological station was constructed near the mouth of the Onyx River. The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 20 minutes between November 24, 1994 and December 30, 1994, every hour between December 30, 1994 and November 21, 1995, and every 15 minutes thereafter. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval. Station was relocated after it was blown away in 2004. Â Onyx River temperature (thermistor) ceased then, as seen in the data record,Â  Season 1994/95 Notes filesÂ vaa94501 through vaa94503.dat 1) Day of year is one day greater than it should be (i.e. first day should be 328) 2) Downward-pointing pyranometer is wired and running but not mounted properly, ignore. 3) Wind speeds &lt; threshold (0.9 m/s) zeroed. Data should be flaggedÂ  file vaa94504.dat 1) Day of year fixed 2) Downward-pointing pyranometer running okay. 3) Collected data at 16:08 4) Moved position of river thermistor to closer location on Jan 20. 5) Keypad changes made to vaa945-1 did not get transfered to .doc file. Therefore, new file loaded with claus that zeros wind Season 1995/96 Notes Report by Gayle Dana. File vaa95001.dat 1) Moved position of river thermistor to closer location on Jan 20. 2) Keypad changes made to vaa945-1 did not get transfered to .doc file.

The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 20 minutes between November 24, 1994 and December 30, 1994, every hour between December 30, 1994 and November 21, 1995, and every 15 minutes thereafter. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval. Station was relocated after it was blown away in 2004.

00045-metadata.xml,Maintenance,/eml:eml/dataset/maintenance,"On September 9, 1999, the data manager added the 1998-1999 data to this dataset. In the process,at the Â request of Thomas Nylen, she did some fine-tuning of the data. Revisions included: Â  Â 1. Removal and flagging of WDir and WDirStd values on Nov 25, 1994 @ 9:20. Since windspeed was zero (0), Â it made no sense to have values for wind direction. Â  Â 2. Addition of PAR values between Dec 30, 1994 @ 17:00 and Jan 20, 1995 @ 15:00. Â  Â On June 1, 2000, the 1999-2000 data was posted. In the process, Denise Steigerwald changed thelayout of Â the files so that they were sorted by category (air temperatures, humidity, radiation,wind etc.) rather than by year. Â Files containing monthly and daily averages were generated andminor adjustments were made to the metadata. Â  Â On June 1, 2000, relative humidity (RH) values were corrected for a systematic error in themeasurement created Â by an instrument manufacturer error. All RH data with air temperaturesbelow freezing were corrected using the vapor pressure over ice (rather than over water which was used initially). The error became quite large for very Â cold temperatures (the correction could grow to around 30%). The formula used for the correction was: Â  Â RH_corr=RH_orig/((A*temp*temp)+(B*temp)+C) Â  Â where Â  Â RH_corr = corrected relative humidity Â RH_orig = original relative humidity Â temp = air temperature Â A = 4.165E-5 Â B = 9.7E-3 Â C = 1.0 Â  Â For example, with an air temperature of -2.3 and RH_orig of 50.6, the RH_corr will be 51.7.Records that Â showed corrected RH values greater tha n or equal to 100 were changed to 99.99and flagged.Â  Â  Â In June 2000, summary files were added to the web containing daily and monthly statistics.These were Â generated by creating 'views' of daily and monthly means, minimums, maximums and counts of the records represented in the Oracle database's meteorology tables. Â  In 2006, metadata was offered in EML format, the specification adopted by the LTER Network. (Gradner, San Gil) Â  In 2014, Metadata was ported to the Drupal Ecological Information Management system (DEIMS, San Gil) Â  In 2015, derivated data (daily amdn monthly averages) was given identifiers and included formally in the MCMLTER data catalog Â  Â  Â "

What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The followingÂ questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence ofÂ shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? Â  2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and Â long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? 4) Do small mammals interact with other herbivore and granivore consumers enough to affect the species composition and abundanceâ€™s of other consumers such as ants and grasshoppers?"

Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots, each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the top to the north. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters. A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points.

The site is subject to intensive research activity, including assessments of net primary productivity, phenology, and pollinator diversity, amongst other projects.  It is the site of the unburned black grama (GU) component of the Burn NPP study. On August 4, 2009, a lightning-initiated fire began on the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. By August 5, 2009, the fire had reached the Five Points Black Grama site.  Portions of this site were burned, but not the entirety.  See individual projects for further information on the effects of the burn.   -106.736 -106.736 34.3331 34.3331 1615 1615 meter"

Rio Salado Grassland & Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites. Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site because the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location Met Station 44.The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.  After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a 'T' in the road at the power lines.  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.  -106.927 -106.927 34.296 34.296 1503 1503 meter"

Â Other plots that are missing from the Grassland Site in the spring are BLOCK 2 PLOT 3 TRT C, BLOCK 3 PLOT 3 TRT R, and BLOCK 4 PLOT 2 TRT C. All plots are present for the fall, but several data points are missing. - Removed Species, Comments, and Per fields. Â Tape field was changed to ID#. If there were no observations made in the previously named Tape field, observations from the Per field were moved to the new ID# field. Â EC field was added and NA was recorded in this field for this year and any comments made were put in this field. Â Date MM/DD/YY field was changed to just DATE. Other changes in the fields include PLT to PLOT, BLK to BLOCK, SPECIES to SD, COV to COVER, and HT to DEPTH. - All quads for this year originally had AD recorded as the soil disturbance seen. Â This is an unknown code. The comments field contained actual soil disturbance codes. Â AD was removed and replaced with the soil disturbance codes found in the comments field. - Negative values in the depth field were given their absolute Â value. - Several quads contained AB for soil disturbance. Â This is an unknown code. AB was changed to AH, arthropod hole, because 1996 data had AB also and stated it was an arthropod burrow. Â We currently use AH to identify all arthropod holes. Also, â€˜originally ABâ€™ was recorded in the EC field for these data points. A few quads had RT, an unknown code, recorded for soil disturbance. Â Changed RT to UD and â€˜originally RTâ€™ was recorded in the EC field. Â Any similar corrections were dealt with in the same manner. - Any data points that had a zero value in cover field were categorized Â SD, which is used when there is no soil disturbance present, and the depth field was given a zero value. - Any empty cells were filled in with either a period for missing data or an NA for not applicable. - Terri Koontz 07/14/03 Â - Modified metadata to correct format. - Terri Koontz 07/21/03 Â - Spring Field Season Changes For Grass Site BLOCK 2 PLOT 1 TRT L, there were two observations for most quads that had different dates (05/02/95, 05/03/95, and 05/04/95).

Chlorophyll a and taxon-specific pigments (chlorophylls and carotenoids) are qualitatively and quantitatively characterized in the lab onshore by several size fractions (< 1µm to > 20µm) utilizing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The samples analyzed within the CCE region are used to develop a metric for phytoplankton community structure that can be used to monitor its state and changes thereof over time."

00048-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. Before 2011, For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations an datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database. ADAPS deprecated in favor of Aquarius software in 2012. Similar procedure is used in Aquarius to convert and curate the data. Metadata was enhanced in 2013 and 2014 by Inigo San Gil"

00048-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Campbell CR10 dataloggers were used to record stream stage, water temperature, and conductivity in a network of stream gages. Stage is monitored with pressure transducers; PSS-1 and PS-2 models form Paroscientific Corporation, and Accubars from Sutron Corporation. The pressure transducers measure the backpressure in orifice lines set into or above controls in the stream channel. In addition, some of the sites monitor water temperature and conductivity with either USGS minimonitor probes, or Campbell temperature/conductivity probes. Ratings are developed for the stage/discharge relationship at each site by measuring streamflow with current meters or portable flumes, according to standard USGS methods. Datum corrections to the stage are determined by periodically surveying the elevation of the orifice line to the control and nearby reference marks. Calibrations for the temperature and conductivity are assessed by measuring these parameters with portable field meters while simultaneously noting the readings from the gage probes. Data is downloaded into Campbell storage modules, and retrieved into pcs. From there, the data is sent to a USGS computer, where time discrepancies are resolved, and the data is loaded into ADAPS, a database system developed in the USGS for maintaining and processing water data. A determination for each site as to when the stream was flowing and when it was not is made. For water temperature and conductivity, bad data is deleted. Variable shifts are determined based on field calibration measurements, and other indicators. The shifts are applied to the remaining good data inside of ADAPS. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. Cases of water temperature below reasonable values are set to lower limits. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into the ORACLE and the McMurdo database. Before 2011, For stage/discharge, bad data is deleted. Survey data is reviewed to compute weir elevations an datum corrections. A rating curve is developed graphically, based on available data, and entered into ADAPS. All applicable shifts and datum corrections are entered into ADAPS. All corrections and ratings are run against the good stage data to compute the discharge at each recording interval. The data is pulled out of ADAPS, and reformatted for input into ORACLE. A quality code is assigned to every value. The resulting data is uploaded into ORACLE and the McMurdo database. ADAPS deprecated in favor of Aquarius software in 2012. Similar procedure is used in Aquarius to convert and curate the data. Metadata was enhanced in 2013 and 2014 by Inigo San Gil"

00048-metadata.xml,Maintenance,/eml:eml/dataset/maintenance,"The 'discrete_stream_gauge' table was created by Harry House in early 1994. It was first stored in an INGRES database, but was converted to ORACLE format in early 1996. Modifications were generally made each year after the initial creation in the early part of the year. It was transferred to INSTAAR in late 1997, where it was stored in a Microsoft Access database, and presented on the web in ascii, comma delimited files. In October, 1999 Mike Gooseff submitted the 1997-98 data to Denise Steigerwald (the data manager) in ascii, comma delimited files. In order to prepare the files for use in an Oracle database as well as a geographic information system, Denise created a field for 'strmgageid' (stream gage id), converted any time fields of 24:00 to 0:00 on the following day, combined the date and time fields into one date/time field, and separated the data into separate files for each station. Data which was previously presented according to decade collected is now presented according to location, and contains records from the start date of monitoring for a given stream gage. The resulting files are available through the links provided above. In order to make the data more relational and useful in Oracle and ArcInfo, and generate links between different data and metadata fields, a dataset code was added to these files. New codes for the COMMENTS column were created in 2005 after a meeting between the stream team and the information manager (Chris Gardner). These comments were added to stream data that were worked up after that point - they usually appear in the data around the 2003 season. 2013 - Added metadata to comply with Network requirements. Inigo San Gil. 2014, moved to the Drupal Ecological Information Management System"

Thus volume calculations within the ice cover represent volumes of liquid water as if the ice was melted.Â  Â  Third order polynomial equations were fit to the area vs. depth data both from Schmok's report and from the digitized map data, using SigmaPlot's curve fitting routine. However, since the contour data are already a 'best-fit' of measured depth data, and contour intervals are relatively small, it was decided to linearly interpolate the depth:area relationships for depths between the measured depth contours, at 0.5m intervals.

There are 15 LTTG research sites currently monitored for litterfall and 8 additional sites where litterfall data was collected but the are no longer active. Three litter trays are placed randomly within each of the plots . Litter trays are 1 m x 1 m wooden frames constructed of 1' x 4' boards with fine screen stapled to the bottom side. Litter is collected in the spring as soon after snowmelt as possible (usually in May). Secondary growth (wood) material is separated from all other plant litter (leaf, flowers, bracts, etc.) and placed in labeled paper bags separately by tray. Litter collections are removed to the lab and dried in ovens at 65 deg C for at least 48 hours. Each sample is then weighed to the nearest 0.1 grams."

00052-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"SAMPLING DESIGN Samples are collected in acid-washed, deionized water-rinsed, polyethylene bottles, from a small waterfall above the stream gauging station, to avoid contamination from ponded debris or weir construction materials. The normal sampling interval is weekly, with more frequent samples taken at times of increased discharge. At low flow summer (drought) conditions, samples may be taken with a clean polyethylene syringe, from undisturbed standing pools in the stream channel. Daily export values (in g/ha-mo) are derived by multiplying daily streamflow amounts (in mm) for watershed 8, by the concentration of solutes (in mg/L) in the WS-8 sample taken on that day. For periods between samples, the average chemistry of the previous and next discrete sample is used for a daily concentration value. Measured and estimated daily values are summed to produce monthly export, and export divided by total monthly streamflow to produce volume-weighted, average monthly concentrations for streamwater at HBEF WS-8. In June 2013, after careful inter-laboratory comparisons, chemical analyses were transferred from the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies Lab to the USDA Forest Service Lab in Durham, NH. Samples are split into 3 aliquots for different analyses. Monomeric Aluminum is measured on an unfiltered-refrigerated aliquot using an automated Pyrocatechol Violet method. A filtered-refrigerated aliquot is acidified and analyzed for cations and metals using ICP-OES (USEPA 200.7). A filtered-frozen sample is used for measuring NH4 (USEPA 350.1 Rev. 2.0), PO4 (USEPA 365.1 Rev. 2.0), Anions (USEPA 300.1) , DOC (USEPA 450.1) and TDN (High Temperature Catalytic Oxidation with chemiluminescent N detection).

00052-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"SAMPLING DESIGN Samples are collected in acid-washed, deionized water-rinsed, polyethylene bottles, from a small waterfall above the stream gauging station, to avoid contamination from ponded debris or weir construction materials. The normal sampling interval is weekly, with more frequent samples taken at times of increased discharge. At low flow summer (drought) conditions, samples may be taken with a clean polyethylene syringe, from undisturbed standing pools in the stream channel. Daily export values (in g/ha-mo) are derived by multiplying daily streamflow amounts (in mm) for watershed 8, by the concentration of solutes (in mg/L) in the WS-8 sample taken on that day. For periods between samples, the average chemistry of the previous and next discrete sample is used for a daily concentration value. Measured and estimated daily values are summed to produce monthly export, and export divided by total monthly streamflow to produce volume-weighted, average monthly concentrations for streamwater at HBEF WS-8.

Bacterial production is determined by the incorporation of 14C labeled Leucine (Simon and Azam 1989) in triplicate water samples incubated in the dark at in situ temperature for 1-3 hours (typically 2 hrs). Water samples are vacuum filtered through 0.22 um Millapore GS cellulose nitrate filters. Samples are extracted with 5mL of 5% TCA for 5 minutes, rinsed with additional TCA, and air dried in mini-scintillation vials. Following the addition of 1 mL cellosolve (ethylene glycol monoethyl ether), filters are left to dissolve overnight. Scinti-safe scintillation cocktail (4 mL) is then added to each vial and samples are counted at Toolik Field Station on a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR) .Calculations of bacterial productivity assume that the Internal Dilution (ID) of leucine is 1, but studies show it may range from 1-2 (Kirchman 1993). Some published data from these LTER files have used an ID value different than 1; in those studies, the ID value used is stated in the article.1. Simon, M., and F. Azam. 1989.

00055-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"A Campbell CR10x data logger, in the LTER Toolik Moist Non-acidic Tussock Experimental plots (block 2), is used to monitor weather and soil temperatures. Sensors in the control and greenhouse plots include: air temperature and relative humidity. These sensors are read every minute and averaged or totaled every hour. Two profiles of soil temperature are measured per treatment plot with copper/constantan thermocouple wires (TC) installed at depths of 0,10, 20, and 40 cm in inter-tussock areas. The following label codes are used: CT = control, GH = greenhouses, NP = fertilized, GHF= greenhouse fertilized, plus a 1 or a 2 for the profile number. All soil sensors are read every 15 minutes and averaged every 3 hours. Hourly, three hourly and daily summaries are in files yyDLMNTH.DAT, yyDLMNTO.DAT, and yyDLMNTD.DAT respectively, where yy is the year in which the data are collected. The original data are in file yyDLMNTDAT.ZIP which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. CALCULATIONS Variable Formula DAYS: JULIAN + (HOUR/2400) VAPOR PRESS 3M: If Air Temp &amp;gt; 0 then (RH /100) * 6.1121 *exp(17.368 * AIR TEMP /(238.88 + AIR TEMP )) If Air Temp &amp;lt; 0 then (RH /100) * 6.1121 *exp(17.966 * AIR TEMP /(238.88 + AIR TEMP )) (Buck 1981). Reference Citations: Buck, A.L.. 1981 New equations for computing vapor pressure and enhancement factor. Journal of Applied Meteorology 20:1527-1532. Notes: The covers on greenhouses are removed every fall and reinstalled every spring. Missing values are indicated by #N/A. Greenhouse air Temperature/RH sensor was not added until Jun15,2000. May 2006 Battery wire corroded and logger lost power. Attached battery but the program in the storage module had an error. The temp/rh instruction did not have a multiplier of 0.1 and offset of -40. Corrected the temperature in the spreadsheet but the RH was all at 100 since the program changes any value above 100 to 100. 13-Ju-l2006 Program corrected but the power wire for the Greenhouse probe was not connected. 27-Apr-2007 Downloaded the storage module. Wires were chewed and the logger had lost power. Reconnected the power multiplexer and Temp/RH. Could not get the Greenhouse Temperature /RH to work. 8-Jun-2008 Replaced GH temperature/RH sensor. 11-Jun-2009 Battery problems. Running only on solar panel so there is no data when sun is low . 24-Jul-2009 Sic Sic made a nest in the battery box and chewed lots of wires. 7-Aug-2009 Repaired wires for most sensor. 11-Aug-2009 Put GH temp/RH back on after repairing the wires. 13-Aug-2009 The GH temp/RH went out."

00055-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"A Campbell CR10x data logger, in the LTER Toolik Moist Non-acidic Tussock Experimental plots (block 2), is used to monitor weather and soil temperatures. Sensors in the control and greenhouse plots include: air temperature and relative humidity. These sensors are read every minute and averaged or totaled every hour. Two profiles of soil temperature are measured per treatment plot with copper/constantan thermocouple wires (TC) installed at depths of 0,10, 20, and 40 cm in inter-tussock areas. The following label codes are used: CT = control, GH = greenhouses, NP = fertilized, GHF= greenhouse fertilized, plus a 1 or a 2 for the profile number. All soil sensors are read every 15 minutes and averaged every 3 hours. Hourly, three hourly and daily summaries are in files yyDLMNTH.DAT, yyDLMNTO.DAT, and yyDLMNTD.DAT respectively, where yy is the year in which the data are collected. The original data are in file yyDLMNTDAT.ZIP which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA.

Notes: The covers on greenhouses are removed every fall and reinstalled every spring. Missing values are indicated by #N/A. Greenhouse air Temperature/RH sensor was not added until Jun15,2000. May 2006 Battery wire corroded and logger lost power. Attached battery but the program in the storage module had an error. The temp/rh instruction did not have a multiplier of 0.1 and offset of -40. Corrected the temperature in the spreadsheet but the RH was all at 100 since the program changes any value above 100 to 100. 13-Ju-l2006 Program corrected but the power wire for the Greenhouse probe was not connected. 27-Apr-2007 Downloaded the storage module. Wires were chewed and the logger had lost power. Reconnected the power multiplexer and Temp/RH. Could not get the Greenhouse Temperature /RH to work. 8-Jun-2008 Replaced GH temperature/RH sensor. 11-Jun-2009 Battery problems. Running only on solar panel so there is no data when sun is low . 24-Jul-2009 Sic Sic made a nest in the battery box and chewed lots of wires. 7-Aug-2009 Repaired wires for most sensor. 11-Aug-2009 Put GH temp/RH back on after repairing the wires. 13-Aug-2009 The GH temp/RH went out."

00056-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We deployed three eddy covariance towers with identical instrumentation across a burn severity gradient (Rocha and Shaver 2009). The three sites (i.e. Severe burn, Moderate burn, and Unburned) were 40 km to the west of the nearest road and were selected during a helicopter survey of the southern area of the Anaktuvuk River Fire scar in late May 2008 (Figure 1; Table 1). Because the fire had burned through September of the previous year, initial deployment of flux towers occurred prior to any significant vegetative regrowth, and our sampling campaign captured the full 2008 growing season (June 1-August 28). Each site was equipped with a Campbell ScientificÂ® CR5000 datalogger that recorded data from micrometeorological instrumentation located on a stainless steel tripod (CM110; Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA) at a height of 2.6 m. Data were stored on a 2 Gb PCMCIA card and downloaded every two to three weeks. Power for the datalogger and instrumentation was located 15 m to the east or west of the tower and consisted of a south-facing solar panel and two 12 V 80 amp-hour batteries enclosed in a polyethylene box. Towers ran continuously through the summer of 2008 with the exception of the severe burn site, which was damaged by a bear during the last week of August. The towers have been in operation since June 2008. Environmental data were recorded as half hour averages. Net radiation was monitored with a NRLITE net radiometer (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA). Incoming and reflected solar and longwave radiation were measured with a CNR-1 Radiometer (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA), while incoming and reflected Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) were measured with a silicon quantum sensor (LI-COR; Lincoln, NE, USA). Air temperature and relative humidity was measured with an HMP45C-L sensor (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA) enclosed in a naturally aspirated radiation shield, while precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525; Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA). Volumetric water content at a depth of 2.5 cm was measured with two reflectometers (CS616; Campbell Scientfic; Logan Utah, USA), soil temperature at a depth of 2 and 6 cm was measured with two averaging soil thermocouples (TCAV-L; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA), and soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm was measured with four soil heat flux plates (HFP01; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA). Measurements of the soil environment were recorded on separate CR1000 dataloggers at the severely and moderately burned sites. Turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 were determined by the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi et al. 1988). Half hourly CO2 and H2O fluxes were calculated as the covariance between the turbulent departures from the mean of the 10 Hz vertical wind speed measured with a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA) and the CO2 and H2O mixing ratio measured with an open path InfraRed Gas Analyzer (IRGA; LI7500; LI-COR; Lincoln, NE, USA). Fluxes were processed using EdiRe software (University of Edinburgh; Moncrieff et al. 1997) and reported using the meteorological sign convention where negative NEE indicates carbon uptake and positive NEE indicates carbon loss from the ecosystem. Ten Hz data were despiked, rotated to the mean wind streamlines, and corrected for the density effect due to sensible heat transfer (i.e. WPL correction; Webb et al. 1980). Turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat captured 78 to 80% of the available energy at each of the sites, which is consistent with energy budget closure observed for other eddy covariance studies (Wilson et al. 2002). The severely burned site consists of a largely absent moss layer (&lt;5% of ground cover) with mineral soil exposed in 10% of area surrounding tower. Recovering and dead tussocks [Eriophorum spp.] formed the dominant canopy cover with burnt duff (60% of ground cover) and few other species ( Cloudberry [Rubus chamaemorus L.], Labrador tea [Ledum palustre L.]) comprising the inter-tussock area. 70% of scorched tussocks recovered from the fire after the first growing season.

00056-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We deployed three eddy covariance towers with identical instrumentation across a burn severity gradient (Rocha and Shaver 2009). The three sites (i.e. Severe burn, Moderate burn, and Unburned) were 40 km to the west of the nearest road and were selected during a helicopter survey of the southern area of the Anaktuvuk River Fire scar in late May 2008 (Figure 1; Table 1). Because the fire had burned through September of the previous year, initial deployment of flux towers occurred prior to any significant vegetative regrowth, and our sampling campaign captured the full 2008 growing season (June 1-August 28). Each site was equipped with a Campbell ScientificÂ® CR5000 datalogger that recorded data from micrometeorological instrumentation located on a stainless steel tripod (CM110; Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA) at a height of 2.6 m. Data were stored on a 2 Gb PCMCIA card and downloaded every two to three weeks. Power for the datalogger and instrumentation was located 15 m to the east or west of the tower and consisted of a south-facing solar panel and two 12 V 80 amp-hour batteries enclosed in a polyethylene box. Towers ran continuously through the summer of 2008 with the exception of the severe burn site, which was damaged by a bear during the last week of August. The towers have been in operation since June 2008. Environmental data were recorded as half hour averages. Net radiation was monitored with a NRLITE net radiometer (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA). Incoming and reflected solar and longwave radiation were measured with a CNR-1 Radiometer (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA), while incoming and reflected Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) were measured with a silicon quantum sensor (LI-COR; Lincoln, NE, USA). Air temperature and relative humidity was measured with an HMP45C-L sensor (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA) enclosed in a naturally aspirated radiation shield, while precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525; Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA). Volumetric water content at a depth of 2.5 cm was measured with two reflectometers (CS616; Campbell Scientfic; Logan Utah, USA), soil temperature at a depth of 2 and 6 cm was measured with two averaging soil thermocouples (TCAV-L; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA), and soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm was measured with four soil heat flux plates (HFP01; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA). Measurements of the soil environment were recorded on separate CR1000 dataloggers at the severely and moderately burned sites. Turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 were determined by the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi et al. 1988). Half hourly CO2 and H2O fluxes were calculated as the covariance between the turbulent departures from the mean of the 10 Hz vertical wind speed measured with a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA) and the CO2 and H2O mixing ratio measured with an open path InfraRed Gas Analyzer (IRGA; LI7500; LI-COR; Lincoln, NE, USA). Fluxes were processed using EdiRe software (University of Edinburgh; Moncrieff et al. 1997) and reported using the meteorological sign convention where negative NEE indicates carbon uptake and positive NEE indicates carbon loss from the ecosystem. Ten Hz data were despiked, rotated to the mean wind streamlines, and corrected for the density effect due to sensible heat transfer (i.e. WPL correction; Webb et al. 1980). Turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat captured 78 to 80% of the available energy at each of the sites, which is consistent with energy budget closure observed for other eddy covariance studies (Wilson et al. 2002). The severely burned site consists of a largely absent moss layer (&lt;5% of ground cover) with mineral soil exposed in 10% of area surrounding tower. Recovering and dead tussocks [Eriophorum spp.] formed the dominant canopy cover with burnt duff (60% of ground cover) and few other species ( Cloudberry [Rubus chamaemorus L.], Labrador tea [Ledum palustre L.]) comprising the inter-tussock area. 70% of scorched tussocks recovered from the fire after the first growing season.

The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Cinder Pipe, a storm drain outlet to the main stem of Spring Branch just off Cinder Road in Timonium, Maryland. The area draining the pipe is about 39 ha and is 8% forested and 22% impervious. Watershed information was taken from delineations created with USGS StreamStats at http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/maryland.html Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a suburban catchment. Theme keywords: stream, watershed, temperature, suburban, Baltimore Ecosystem Study Coordinates: Lat/Long 39.4408 (39 26 27) -76.6097 (-76 36 35)"

00059-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The experiment is the LTER nutrient by warming factorial treatments, which has 4 randomized blocks (Shaver et al.?). We randomly collected 3 individual ramets of Betula nana from each treatment within each block. The most recent 15 years of growth were analyzed for each ramet. Stems were cut and cross-sections made by hand with a razor blade. Ages were determined by staining the sections with 1% phloroglucinol in 20% HCl and counting the growth rings using a compound light microscope at 100x magnification. Stems were separated into different age classes trying to get at least one piece with same age on both ends for each age class. Lengths and weights of pooled segments for a given age class were determined after drying samples at 70 degrees C for 48 hours. Because no external bud scars were usually visible, the boundary between age classes of stems usually could not be known with certainty. The lengths and weights of stem pieces that overlapped one year boundary were assigned half to one age and half to the next. Lengths and weights of pieces that overlapped more than one age class were assigned to the different age classes by dividing by one less than the number of years covered, and assigning half that amount to the two end pieces and the whole amount to intervening years, to avoid a bias toward the end pieces. When the end of the piece was the bottom of a branch, and therefore that boundary was known with certainty, the piece was divided by x.5, where x is one less than the number of years that the piece overlapped. Half that amount was assigned to the upper part of the segment, where the boundary was not known with certainty, while the whole amount was assigned to the other year classes covered by that piece, including the oldest piece. These procedures avoided a bias in assigning weight and length disproportionately to the years where a cut was made. Betula nana makes two types of stem segments, short shoots and long shoots. Long shoots could be aged by making stem cross-sections, but short shoots could not because they have so little secondary growth. However, the maximum age of short shoots is one year less than the long shoot to which they are attached. Short shoot weight and length was assigned by dividing the total weight or length by the maximum age of those shoots and assigning that to each year class up to that age. Short shoots occasionally convert to long shoots, in which case they put on secondary growth and behave like a long shoot from then on (but obviously the stem segments covering the period of short shoot growth do not increase in length). These conversions from short to long shoots were classified separately in the data table. Notes: Betula nana rep 1 from block 3 was excluded because it was diseased. No other data is missing. Data in columns with stippled headings were measured data, other columns are calculated from that data.

00059-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The experiment is the LTER nutrient by warming factorial treatments, which has 4 randomized blocks (Shaver et al.?). We randomly collected 3 individual ramets of Betula nana from each treatment within each block. The most recent 15 years of growth were analyzed for each ramet. Stems were cut and cross-sections made by hand with a razor blade. Ages were determined by staining the sections with 1% phloroglucinol in 20% HCl and counting the growth rings using a compound light microscope at 100x magnification. Stems were separated into different age classes trying to get at least one piece with same age on both ends for each age class. Lengths and weights of pooled segments for a given age class were determined after drying samples at 70 degrees C for 48 hours. Because no external bud scars were usually visible, the boundary between age classes of stems usually could not be known with certainty. The lengths and weights of stem pieces that overlapped one year boundary were assigned half to one age and half to the next. Lengths and weights of pieces that overlapped more than one age class were assigned to the different age classes by dividing by one less than the number of years covered, and assigning half that amount to the two end pieces and the whole amount to intervening years, to avoid a bias toward the end pieces. When the end of the piece was the bottom of a branch, and therefore that boundary was known with certainty, the piece was divided by x.5, where x is one less than the number of years that the piece overlapped. Half that amount was assigned to the upper part of the segment, where the boundary was not known with certainty, while the whole amount was assigned to the other year classes covered by that piece, including the oldest piece. These procedures avoided a bias in assigning weight and length disproportionately to the years where a cut was made. Betula nana makes two types of stem segments, short shoots and long shoots. Long shoots could be aged by making stem cross-sections, but short shoots could not because they have so little secondary growth. However, the maximum age of short shoots is one year less than the long shoot to which they are attached. Short shoot weight and length was assigned by dividing the total weight or length by the maximum age of those shoots and assigning that to each year class up to that age. Short shoots occasionally convert to long shoots, in which case they put on secondary growth and behave like a long shoot from then on (but obviously the stem segments covering the period of short shoot growth do not increase in length). These conversions from short to long shoots were classified separately in the data table. Notes: Betula nana rep 1 from block 3 was excluded because it was diseased. No other data is missing. Data in columns with stippled headings were measured data, other columns are calculated from that data. Data from pieces that were overlapping age classes but were not conversions are entered in measured data columns as additions onto the original numbers (e.g. the formula shows =x+y+z).

00060-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"General Methods At approximately half of the locations sampled on twelve quarterly cruises by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) from January 1994 through November 1996, samples were taken to estimate the biomass of phytoplankton ≥ 8 μm, defined as chlorophyll retained on a membrane filter of this nominal pore diameter (filter type). On these cruises, samples were routinely taken from several depths with closing water bottles on a rosette with a CTD, and the seston from each bottle retained on a GF/F glass fiber was extracted for chlorophyll, determined fluorometrically. From each of the shallowest ten of these water bottles (representing samples from the surface to approximately 100 m or shallower), an additional 140 ml sample was withdrawn; these were combined and filtered through the 8 pm membrane filter, which was then extracted and analyzed as were the ten GF/F filters representing the same sampled depths. Biomasses of chlorophyll per unit volume were then integrated to 100 m for both the total phytoplankton (GF/F filters, ten samples integrated algebraically) and the ≥ 8 μm phytoplankton (membrane filter, one physically integrated sample) to give biomass in mg chlorophyll. m-2. The biomass of cells <8 μm was calculated as the difference between total and ≥ 8 μm chlorophyll, although this procedure means that <8 μm chlorophyll is not an independent variable for statistical analysis. In a few cases, the measured biomass of ≥ 8 μm cells as chlorophyll exceeded that of total chlorophyll, presumably due to subsampling or analytical variability. In these cases, the biomass of large cells was taken to be 100% that of the total."

00061-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"This section contains specific methods for this dataset. Thirty vibracores were collected across Hog Island Bay, VA spanning the barrier island-lagoon-mainland marsh platform complex. Cores were retrieved in 7.6 cm diameter aluminum core liners, split, photographed, logged, and sampled for grain-size and micro-fossil analysis.  X-ray radiographs were made at selected sections in the cores. Grain-size distributions were determined using standard sieving and pipetting techniques at 0.5 phi intervals (Folk 1980).  Initially, samples were wet sieved through a 62 micrometer stainless steel sieve to separate the sand and mud fractions.  The coarse fraction was then fractioned by agitation for 15 min with a standard sieve shaking apparatus.  The weight of each fraction was determined gravimetrically to 0.0001 g.  The distribution of the fine fraction was determined using standard pipetting techniques.  Cumulative weight-frequency graphs were made for each sample and the graphic mean, median, sorting, skewness and kurtosis were determined. Organic matter in percentage by weight was also determined. (from Oertel et al. 1989. Marine Geology 88:303-318 in reference to similar vibracore samples taken in Cobb Island Bay at sites CI, LC, and MC)"

Thirty vibracores were collected across Hog Island Bay, VA spanning the barrier island-lagoon-mainland marsh platform complex. Cores were retrieved in 7.6 cm diameter aluminum core liners, split, photographed, logged, and sampled for grain-size and micro-fossil analysis.  X-ray radiographs were made at selected sections in the cores. Grain-size distributions were determined using standard sieving and pipetting techniques at 0.5 phi intervals (Folk 1980).  Initially, samples were wet sieved through a 62 micrometer stainless steel sieve to separate the sand and mud fractions.  The coarse fraction was then fractioned by agitation for 15 min with a standard sieve shaking apparatus.  The weight of each fraction was determined gravimetrically to 0.0001 g.  The distribution of the fine fraction was determined using standard pipetting techniques.  Cumulative weight-frequency graphs were made for each sample and the graphic mean, median, sorting, skewness and kurtosis were determined.

00062-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The Mt. Fleming meteorological station was added to the McMurdo Dry Valley network in the 1995-1996 field season. It was established on the shore of Mt. Fleming in Victoria Valley, one of the largest lakes in the dry valleys, recently discovered to have a 19 m ice cover over a hypersaline brine of undetermined depth. The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 15 minutes. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval.

00065-metadata.xml,Supplemental Information,/eml:eml/dataset/additionalInfo,"Grassland: The sampling locations for the grassland habitat are located along the road between Black Butte and 5-Points. Stations are numbered as follows, from north to south: 146, 147, 140, 141 142, 143, 144 and 145. All stakes are locatedÂ  on the east side of the road. As one drives south from Black Butte, Station #138 (changed to 146 in the spring of 1995 because old tag lost) is located 1.2 miles south of the road intersection immediately east of Black Butte. Stations are then located at 0.5 mile intervals. There are eight total stations.Creosote: The sampling locations for the creosote shrubland are located on or near the road that runs along the north rim ofÂ  Palo Duro Canyon (east and west of 5-points). Stakes are numbered from #130 through #137, and are located on the north side of the road. Stake locations are as follows: #130 West of 5-points at Pipeline Road; mileage = 0.0 #131 Heading east, site is on road; mileage = 0.3 #132 Heading east, site is on road; mileage = 0.6 #133 Turn south on 'Neck Road', site is on road (stake is on west side of road); mileage = 1.0 from # 130 #134 Return to main east-west read, turn east and proceed to intersection of road coming from north (the 'common garden' road). Keep going east 0.1 mile, and look for flagged stake on south side of road. Sample point is 200 meters south of road near the tall 'A-100' rebar post of the rodent trapping web. #135 At 5-points, in the center of the triangle formed by the three main roads. Flagged stake is on the east-west road, north side. Sample point is 50 meters north of road. Zero odometer here for next two stations. #136 Proceed east on road 0.3 miles from #135. Flagged stake in on north side of road, and sample point is 50 meters north of road. #137 Proceed east on road 0.7 miles from # 135. Flagged stake is on north side of road. Sample point is on road.Pinyon-Juniper: Sample locations are in Goat Draw. All sample points are off the main road, on high ground to one side or the other. Flagged stakes mark parking positions on road, and flagged, numbered stakes mark sampling points. Stations are numbered from #121 in the lower canyon to #129 in the upper canyon. There are nine total staions (eight regular stations and one station at the Goat Draw well site). Odometer is zeroed at sign-in box near entrance gate. Stake locations are as follows: #121 Mileage = 0.7 Sample location is on hill to west. #122 Mileage = 1.3 Goat Draw Well. Sample location is on small hill west of well near house ruins. #123 Mileage = 1.7 Sample location is on hill to west. #124 Mileage = 2.2 Sample location is on hill to west. #125 Mileage = 2.7 Sample location is on hill to west. #126 Mileage = 3.35 Sample location is to the east of road on ridgetop. #127 Mileage = 3.7 Sample location is on top of hill by road. #128 Mileage = 4.3 Sample location is at Meteorological Station approximately 150 meters to the west. #129 Mileage = 4.7 Sample location is on hill to north (right side of road).

00065-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data was collected from 1991 through 1997.Â  Each habitat was sampled on a single morning in winter, spring, summer, and fall, totalling three sampling efforts per year per site. Sampling was done in the last two weeks of February, May, August, and December.Â  Year-to-year variation likely affected bird patterns relative to the schedule, but these dates generally enabled an accurate sampling of species richness and abundance. Weather permitting, each of the three habitats were surveyed over three consecutive days.Â  Unseasonable conditions, windy mornings (7+ mph), and rain were avoided. Bird densities were sampled using a Variable Circular Plot Census technique. There were eight sampling locations in each of the three habitat types. (However, the sampling design did not include replication, and, therefore, estimates of density should be considered tentative.)Â  At each sampling location the observer stood at a stake for nine minutes and scanned for bird activity. All individuals seen and/or heard within a 200 meter radius were recorded.Â  For each bird observation these variables were recorded: species ID (according to the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU)), estimated distance from sampling location in meters, cardinal direction, and detection mode (sight or sound). The observer also tallied individuals flying over a sample area and included these in the data. Additional birds observed while travelling between sampling locations were noted but not included in the data set.Â  Finally, weather conditions at the beginning and end of each daily sample were recorded. This included an estimate of wind speed (mph) and cloud cover (using an eight-point scale: 0 (clear) to 8 (completely overcast)), and a measurement of temperature."

00066-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"Don Juan Pond is located in the west end of the Wright Valley. It is wedged between the Asgard Range and the Dias. On the west end there is a small tributary and a feature that has been described as a rock glacier. Don Juan Pond is a shallow (i.e. flat bottom) hyper-saline pond. The salinity is high enough that it doesn't freeze even in winter. Therefore, unlike other lakes and ponds in the dry valleys, it has no ice cover. It has been described as a groundwater discharge zone. The dominant ions in solution are calcium and chloride. The area around Don Juan Pond is covered with sodium chloride and calcium chloride salts that have been precipitated as the water evaporated. Area and volume of Don Juan Pond varies over time. According to the USGS topo map published in 1977, the area was approximately 0.25 sq. km. However, in recent years the size of the pond has shrunk considerably. The pond has changed over the past 5 years although this is mostly anecdotal. The maximum depth in 93-94 was described as 'a foot deep.' In Jan 97, it was approximately 10cm deep; in Dec 98 the pond was almost dry everywhere except for an area 10's of sq meters. Most of the water that was left was restricted to depressions around large boulders in the pond.

00067-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Native vegetation is the key resource upon which rangelands are built, and restoring rangeland ecosystems are one of the most critical challenges facing rangeland managers today. This experimental fire research project, in collaboration with the USFWS and the Sevilleta LTER, is intended to provide FWS and other land managers of southwestern grasslands and rangelands with information about vegetation recovery following fire under different seasonal conditions and burning treatments. This experimental research will enable the FWS to more effectively set project objectives for prescribed burning on the Sevilleta NWR to benefit not only wildlife habitat, but to better align the timing and intensity of fire to benefit the reestablishment of the dominant native grama grasses Bouteloua eriopoda and B. gracilis. Since its creation in 1973, management has been devoted to restoring the Sevilleta NWR to the natural conditions that might have been seen around the turn of the century. The Sevilleta NWR is an ideal place for research because climatic conditions, plant species composition and net primary production following wildfire have been well documented by the Sevilleta LTER. Additional experimental research is needed, however, to better inform managers about the timing and use of fire as an ecosystem restoration and management tool. Data collection and analysis will be continued by the Sevilleta LTER beyond the requested funding period."

00068-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"SAMPLING DESIGN Each stream was sampled at 100m intervals, from the confluence with the main Hubbard Brook, to the first running water, typically at the top of each watershed. Major side channels for 2nd and 3rd-order streams were also sampled at 100m intervals to first running water. Each of the major tributary watersheds was sampled in one day. Some watersheds were relatively simple, so that several similar streams could be sampled in one day. Other watersheds had a variety of branching patterns and rugged terrain that took an entire day to cover. Coverage is more complete (750 samples in the fall vs 650 in the spring) in the fall survey for 2 reasons: 1) streams gradually dried up in the late spring, early summer survey as leaf-out progressed; 2) streams tended to wet-up in the fall after deciduous leaf abscission. Thus, the distance to first running water was often extended in the second survey. All the major perennial streams in the HBEF Valley were included. There were a number of stream channels that were not sampled because they were dry. These evidently were ephemeral tributaries that contained water only briefly during snowmelt runoff and following heavy rain events. SAMPLE SITE LOCATION Samples were taken at 100m intervals determined by walking up the channels with a hip-chain in the first survey. On reaches with a sinusoidal pattern, the straight-line distance between samples sites could be much shorter than 100m. Labeled, polypropylene flags were inserted in the stream bank at each site along with a tape streamer for quick identification during the second round. Locations were determined using a hand-held GPS receiver (Garmen Vista). Elevations were taken from a USGS DEM provided in Terrain Navigator mapping software. Sample sites could be roughly located by the branching pattern of the systematic watershed and site numbering system (see data Format next), but this could be highly inaccurate because no system was found that could number forked channels as to direction left/right, or east/west, etc. SCOPE OF WORK Samples were collected in the spring after snowmelt and again in the fall before winter snowfall. The initial plan was to reduce the two collection periods to a minimum of a few weeks each to provide near-instantaneous ‘snap-shots’ of biogeochemical conditions throughout the Valley. However, this proved to be impossible, given the logistics involved in sampling nearly simultaneously all the major tributaries to Hubbard Brook. As a result, each time period extended to almost 2 months. There were no heavy rains and resultant high stream flows on days when samples were collected. Thus, we have some confidence that hydrologic conditions were not radically different between streams during each survey. Furthermore, our long-term data from the gauged watersheds indicates that the relationship between stream flow and solute concentration is relatively weak for most solutes, even across 5 orders of magnitude increases in flow. Spring snowmelt in 2001 proceeded remarkably gradually and without any rain-augmented high flows. There were no heavy rain events in the fall of 2001, prior to our collection, and a permanent snow pack did not develop until after we had finished. ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL The chemical measurements were made at HBEF in the RS Pierce Ecosystems Laboratory (N. Woodstock, NH), or at the Cary Institute of Ecosystems Studies Analytical Laboratory (Millbrook, NY), or at the US Forest Service Laboratory (Durham, NH). Analytical protocols and estimates of accuracy and precision are described in detail by Buso et al. (2000). Quality control procedures used as a standard for the long-term Hubbard Brook chemical data were applied to these data as well. DATA PROTOCOL The main Hubbard Brook (HB) watershed was labeled #88. The tributary watersheds (WS-) were numbered by the approximate distance in meters, divided by 10, upstream from the Rte 3 bridge over HB (starting point of the survey). For example, WS-70 (Mirror Lake outlet stream) enters HB at about 700m above Rte 3; WS-1305 (Lost Brook) enters HB about 13 km upstream of Rte 3. Larger branches on 4th order streams were given separate watershed labels: e.g. WS-868 (Canyon Brook) branched into 868 (east fork) and 869 (west fork). The decision to choose the main stem at a fork was based on an estimate of observed flow and not the base map. Sample sites were numbered starting at site 0 (a few meters above the entry point of the tributary to the main Hubbard Brook) and increased upstream at 100m intervals: e.g. WS-392, Site 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. Branches on tributaries were numbered according to the distance along the 100m interval: e.g., WS-392 branches at 1530m above HB, giving rise to site number 15.30. Additional sample sites on these branches were numbered by 100m intervals from the point of branching: e.g., in WS-392, we collected three more samples up branch 15.30, at sites numbered 15.31, 15.32, and 15.33. While obviously flawed from the standpoint of perfect fractal nomenclature, this was an on-the-fly decision that allowed for quick identification of bottles and corresponding field notes. The main Hubbard Brook (preset as WS-88) was sampled just upstream of each tributary and these sites were labeled with the tributary watershed number: e.g. WS-88, Site-1074 was the main HB sample taken just above the main stem of Kineo Brook (WS-1074).

00068-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"SAMPLING DESIGN Each stream was sampled at 100m intervals, from the confluence with the main Hubbard Brook, to the first running water, typically at the top of each watershed. Major side channels for 2nd and 3rd-order streams were also sampled at 100m intervals to first running water. Each of the major tributary watersheds was sampled in one day. Some watersheds were relatively simple, so that several similar streams could be sampled in one day. Other watersheds had a variety of branching patterns and rugged terrain that took an entire day to cover. Coverage is more complete (750 samples in the fall vs 650 in the spring) in the fall survey for 2 reasons: 1) streams gradually dried up in the late spring, early summer survey as leaf-out progressed; 2) streams tended to wet-up in the fall after deciduous leaf abscission. Thus, the distance to first running water was often extended in the second survey. All the major perennial streams in the HBEF Valley were included. There were a number of stream channels that were not sampled because they were dry. These evidently were ephemeral tributaries that contained water only briefly during snowmelt runoff and following heavy rain events. SAMPLE SITE LOCATION Samples were taken at 100m intervals determined by walking up the channels with a hip-chain in the first survey. On reaches with a sinusoidal pattern, the straight-line distance between samples sites could be much shorter than 100m. Labeled, polypropylene flags were inserted in the stream bank at each site along with a tape streamer for quick identification during the second round. Locations were determined using a hand-held GPS receiver (Garmen Vista). Elevations were taken from a USGS DEM provided in Terrain Navigator mapping software. Sample sites could be roughly located by the branching pattern of the systematic watershed and site numbering system (see data Format next), but this could be highly inaccurate because no system was found that could number forked channels as to direction left/right, or east/west, etc. SCOPE OF WORK Samples were collected in the spring after snowmelt and again in the fall before winter snowfall. The initial plan was to reduce the two collection periods to a minimum of a few weeks each to provide near-instantaneous ‘snap-shots’ of biogeochemical conditions throughout the Valley. However, this proved to be impossible, given the logistics involved in sampling nearly simultaneously all the major tributaries to Hubbard Brook. As a result, each time period extended to almost 2 months. There were no heavy rains and resultant high stream flows on days when samples were collected. Thus, we have some confidence that hydrologic conditions were not radically different between streams during each survey. Furthermore, our long-term data from the gauged watersheds indicates that the relationship between stream flow and solute concentration is relatively weak for most solutes, even across 5 orders of magnitude increases in flow. Spring snowmelt in 2001 proceeded remarkably gradually and without any rain-augmented high flows. There were no heavy rain events in the fall of 2001, prior to our collection, and a permanent snow pack did not develop until after we had finished.

Cores were taken from 6 different locations in the backbarrier on the south end of Metompkin island, with varying along- and cross-shore distances. The core sites are labelled MA-MF (eg: Metompkin core A, Metompkin core B, etc.), and each has an associated set of latitude and longitude coordinates showing the location where the core was taken. Included is the data for the percent organic matter, measured at 5cm intervals in the core, via loss-on-ignition experiments. Also included is the data for the percent sand, measured at 10cm intervals in the core, using a LS 13 320 particle analyzer."

00073-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Study Plot Soil Metadata Participants Peter Groffman, Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies Richard V. Pouyat, U.S. Forest Service Introduction The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has established a network of long-term permanent biogeochemical study plots. These plots will provide long-term data on vegetation, soil and hydrologic processes in the key ecosystem types within the urban ecosystem. The current network of study plots includes eight forest plots, chosen to represent the range of forest conditions in the area, and four grass plots. These plots are complemented by a network of 200 less intensive study plots located across the Baltimore metropolitan area. See Baltimore's Vegetation Structure And Its Ability To Remove Air Pollutants And Sequester Carbon Dioxide, online: http://beslter.org/frame4-page_3b_02.html . Plots are currently instrumented with lysimeters (drainage and tension) to sample soil solution chemistry, time domain reflectometry probes to measure soil moisture, dataloggers to measure and record soil temperature and trace gas flux chambers to measure the flux of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and methane from soil to the atmosphere. Measurements of in situ nitrogen mineralization, nitrification and denitrification were made at approximately monthly intervals from Fall 1998 - Fall 2000. Detailed vegetation characterization (all layers) was done in summer 1998. Data from these plots has been published in Groffman et al. (2006, 2009), Groffman and Pouyat (2009) and Savva et al. (2010). Plot Locations and Characterizations In November of 1998 four rural, forested plots were established at Oregon Ridge Park in Baltimore County northeast of the Gwynns Falls Watershed. Oregon Ridge Park contains Pond Branch, the forested reference watershed for BES. Two of these four plots are located on the top of a slope; the other two are located midway up the slope. In June of 2010 measurements at the mid-slope sites on Pond Branch were discontinued. Monuments and equipment remain at the two plots. These plots were replaced with two lowland riparian plots; Oregon upper riparian and Oregon lower riparian. Each riparian sites has four 5 cm by 1-2.5 meter depth slotted wells laid perpendicular to the stream, four tension lysimeters at 10 cm depth, five time domain reflectometry probes, and four trace gas flux chambers in the two dominant microtopographic features of the riparian zones - high spots (hummocks) and low spots (hollows). Four urban, forested plots were established in November 1998, two at Leakin Park and two adjacent to Hillsdale Park in west Baltimore City in the Gwynns Falls. One of the plots in Hillsdale Park was abandoned in 2004 due to continued vandalism. In May 1999 two grass, lawn plots were established at McDonogh School in Baltimore County west of the city in the Gwynns Falls. One of these plots is an extremely low intensity management area (mowed once or twice a year) and one is in a low intensity management area (frequent mowing, no fertilizer or herbicide use). In 2009, the McDonogh plots were abandoned due to management changes at the school. Two grass lawn plots were established on the campus of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in fall 2000. One of these plots is in a medium intensity management area (frequent mowing, moderate applications of fertilizer and herbicides) and one is in a high intensity management area (frequent mowing, high applications of fertilizer and herbicides).

The lawn plots had chambers identical to those used by Bowden et al. (1990) installed flush with the soil surface to allow mowing. These (three per plot, at least 5 m apart and at least 5 m from the plot boundary) consisted of 28.7-cm diameter (ID) by 4.0-cm high polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders which were placed on permanently installed PVC base rings immediately prior to measurement. From 1998 through September 2007, the forest plots had the chambers described by Goldman et al. (1995), constructed from 16.5 cm wide by 20 cm long pieces of PVC pipe fitted with a septum and an air-tight well cap. These chambers were placed 4 cm into the soil and had a total volume of 2 L. Beginning in September 2007, the Bowden et al. (1990) chambers, which are used at many research sites across the world, were installed at the forest sites. A brief period of side by side measurements suggested that the Bowden chambers produce lower gas fluxes than the Goldman chambers. The replacement dates for chambers at different sites are: -Leakin 1 September 2007 -Leakin 2 Septemeber 2007 -Hillsdale 1 Sept 2007 -Oregon Ridge Upper 1 November 2007 -Oregon Ridge Upper 2 November 2007 -Oregon Ridge Middle 1 September 2007 -Oregon Ridge Middle 2 September 2007 At 0, 10, 20 and 30 min following placement of the chamber on the base or installation of the well cap, 9-mL gas samples were collected from gas sampling ports in the center of the chamber top by syringe. Samples were injected into 9 mL evacuated glass vials sealed with septa and aluminum rings. Samples were sent to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (CIES) for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. Concentrations of CO2 and N2O are measured on a GC equipped with thermal conductivity and electron capture detectors aligned in sequence. Concentrations of CH4 are measured on a GC equipped with a flame ionization detector. Samples and standards are introduced into this GC via syringe and sample loop. Fluxes were calculated from the linear rate of change in gas concentration, the chamber internal volume and soil surface area. Spike standards are processed along with each batch of flux samples. These standards are generated by filling sample vials from a standard tank in the field laboratory in Baltimore and then processing these samples along with samples taken from flux chambers in the field. Percent recoveries of the trip standards are used to correct flux values for leakage or gas absorption that may occur between sampling and analysis. Exceptionally low recoveries for N2O (traced to a change in septa manufacture) led to loss of flux data for this gas for several dates from 2007 - 2009.

Fluxes were calculated from the linear rate of change in gas concentration, the chamber internal volume and soil surface area. Spike standards are processed along with each batch of flux samples. These standards are generated by filling sample vials from a standard tank in the field laboratory in Baltimore and then processing these samples along with samples taken from flux chambers in the field. Percent recoveries of the trip standards are used to correct flux values for leakage or gas absorption that may occur between sampling and analysis. Exceptionally low recoveries for N2O (traced to a change in septa manufacture) led to loss of flux data for this gas for several dates from 2007 - 2009."

00074-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Water column samples are collected along an estuarine salinity gradient as part of our monitoring surveys of the Parker River estuary each spring and late summer (typically high vs low freshwater input). Samples are filtered, and stored frozen for later pigment analyses by HPLC. Pigment data are then analyzed by CHEMTAX, calibrated to a matrix of pigment ratios based on taxonomy and enumeration of selected subsamples by microspcopy. Data are presented in terms of chlorophyll a concentrations partitionaed among the major phytoplankton groups as determined by CHEMTAX. For 2003-2006, sampling stations along the Plum Island Sound-Parker River were at fixed geographic locations at specific 'Bends' in the river. In 2008, we began sampling the water column in salinity space rather than at specific geographic locations along the river. This sampling approach was adopted in order to follow particular water masses in this macrotidal estuary. In practical terms, it means that sampling locations, or stations, are not static. Therefore, we have mapped the 11 sampling locations (latitude and longitude are logged at each station) from each transect along the mainstem of the estuary, so each station may be placed along the river (to the nearest 0.5km) as well as in salinity space. We have also used the km marker to assign the sampling locations from each survey to one of four bounding boxes : the Sound (Plum Island Sound; EST-PR-SoundBND) which encompasses approximatly the first 9.5 km or the transect, with Okm at the mouth of the sound; the Lower Parker River (EST-PR-LowerParkerBND) , ~9.5 - 14.5 km; the Middle Parker River (EST-PRMiddleParkerBND), ~14.5 - 18.75 km, and the Upper Parker River (EST-PR-UpperParker BND)., ~18.75 to 24.25 km (the Parker R. Dam)."

Therefore, we have mapped the 11 sampling locations (latitude and longitude are logged at each station) from each transect along the mainstem of the estuary, so each station may be placed along the river (to the nearest 0.5km) as well as in salinity space. We have also used the km marker to assign the sampling locations from each survey to one of four bounding boxes : the Sound (Plum Island Sound; EST-PR-SoundBND) which encompasses approximatly the first 9.5 km or the transect, with Okm at the mouth of the sound; the Lower Parker River (EST-PR-LowerParkerBND) , ~9.5 - 14.5 km; the Middle Parker River (EST-PRMiddleParkerBND), ~14.5 - 18.75 km, and the Upper Parker River (EST-PR-UpperParker BND)., ~18.75 to 24.25 km (the Parker R. Dam). HPLC and Chem Tax analyses are performed by the HPLC Photopigment Analysis Facility at the University of South Carolina, under the direction of Dr. James Pinckney. The procedure is similar to the standard method for filtering water samples for Chl a analysis by fluorometry or spectrophotometry. For HPLC analysis, the approach is to collect as much material as possible to provide high resolution of all the algal groups present and facilitate the confirmation of pigment identities by comparisons with absorption spectra for authentic standards. The basic filtration steps are as follows: 1. Collect water (2 gallons for IBYC, Nelson, Station 24, Station 22 and 1 gallon for Stations 20, 18, 16, 12, 8, 4, 0) in a clean container. Keep the water cool and in the dark during transport and short-term storage (an insulated cooler with a little ice works well). The time from collection to filtration should be less than 3 hours. There will be a whole water sample filtered as described below, need 2 replicates or 2 filters per station. There will also be a < 20 um sample which is whole water prescreened through 20 um nitex where the filtrate will then be filtered as described below, need 2 replicates or 2 filters per station. 2. Using square-ended forceps (to prevent poking a hole in the filter), place a single Whatman GF/F filter (2.5cm) onto a Gelman filter funnel. Make sure the funnel forms a tight seal with the base. 3. The filter funnel should be attached to a vacuum system. We use a home-made PVC manifold that holds several funnels, and each funnel has a valve to open/close the vacuum. The manifold is attached to heavy-walled tygon tubing and a large vacuum flask (5 gallon glass water bottle). A second hose runs from the carboy to the vacuum pump. Use a moderate vacuum for the filtrations (ca. 100 to 200 mm Hg, or <7 in. Hg vac). 4. Open the vacuum and pour in a pre-measured amount (using a clean graduated cylinder) of sample water. This is the tricky part. You may have to use trial and error to determine how much water you can filter before the filter clogs. Samples closer to the mouth of Plum Island Sound will require larger volumes (500-1000ml) than samples up the Parker River (150-700ml) depending upon season and discharge. Filter water samples in duplicate, then pool the two filters for HPLC analyses. Be sure to record the total volume of water filtered for each duplicate sample. 5. Using square-tipped forceps, gently fold the filter in half, with the side containing the sample on the inside of the fold. Remove the filter, keeping it folded, and place the filter between two sheets of tissue paper (we use paper towels). Gently press the filter with your thumb to remove excess water from the filter. (Excess water in the filter reduces the extraction efficiency of the acetone solvent). 6. Label the outside of a small piece of aluminum foil (a square piece with dimensions of 5 x 5 cm) with the sample identification number. Use a black sharpie pen and make sure the ink dries (sharpie ink will destroy the pigment analysis….and the filters are magnets for sharpie ink!) 7. Place the duplicate filters together (keeping them folded in half) onto the foil and fold the foil so that the label appears on the outside. Make sure the filter is completely covered by the foil wrapper. Bend the edges of the foil to make sure the filter is sealed within the foil. Place the foil in a freezer (the colder the better). Transport to MBL in small ChemTax cooler box with ice pack. Keep the sample completely frozen and in the dark until you are ready to conduct the HPLC analysis. Samples can be stored for as long as 1 year at -80 C. 8. Fill out ChemTax Transect data sheet with information about samples. 9. For shipping t othe USC lab, the samples should be sent Express Overnight in a styrofoam cooler filled with dry ice. Fill any empty space with newspaper. Please let the lab know when you are shipping so that thety can be on the lookout for the shipment. Plan shipments to avoid weekend delays. NOTES and COMMENTS The initial pigment ratios used by ChemTax were based on published values for estuarine populations (Roy et al. 2011; Schlüter et al., 2000) selected to fit results of microscopy of a subset of duplicate samples (David Borkman, URI) from the Parker River estuary. Microscopy was important in both defining the groups and for qualitative evaluation of ChemTax. At PIE, the chlorophyll a apportioned to the combined category 'Diatoms &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Chrysophytes' is largely diatom chlorophyll. We are continuing the comparisons between CHEMTAX and microscopy, which may lead to further refinements to the calibration.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

These will form part of a network of observatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interaction with the global system.In support of these objectives, a 3m eddy covariance station was established on a low ridge adjacent to Imnavait Creek, Alaska. This station has been continuously monitoring carbon dioxide, water vapor, energy fluxes and various micrometeorological variables."

00076-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected.This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold&#039;s decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the &#039;Burba&#039; correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters forÂ previously flagged dataÂ including &#039;-9999&#039;. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn&#039;t available will sometimes have various flag strings in use.Â This will standardize everything to &#039;NaN&#039;.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.See the file IC_1991_Metadata_2007.csv for data collection statistics.

00076-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected.This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold&#039;s decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the &#039;Burba&#039; correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters forÂ previously flagged dataÂ including &#039;-9999&#039;. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn&#039;t available will sometimes have various flag strings in use.Â This will standardize everything to &#039;NaN&#039;.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.See the file IC_1991_Metadata_2007.csv for data collection statistics.

00077-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"These data describe the abundance of common mobile macro invertebrates and macroalgae located at SBC LTER long-term kelp removal experiment sites. The number of individuals of approximately 50 taxa are recorded in 40 m x 2 m transects in each plot. Large algae and large mobile invertebrates are enumerated within selected 20 m2sub-sections on each 40 m x 2 m transect and small algae and small invertebrates are enumerated in six permanent 1 m2quadrats positioned uniformly along the 40 m x 2 m transect. The kelp removal experiment was initiated in 2008 at selected reef sites along the mainland coast of the Santa Barbara Channel. The following three giant kelp manipulations are maintained in sampling plots at each site: Control:Macrocystis pyriferais left intact in a 2000 m2plot. Annual removal:Macrocystis pyriferais removed from an adjacent 2000 m2plot once each winter and allowed to re-colonize over the course of the year. Continuous removal:Macrocystis pyriferais removed from a 200 m2area within the 2000 m2plot on each sampling date."

As in many temperate regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs. Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.

00078-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Initial tree circumferences and diameters were measured at 1.25 m above the ground, and stainless steel dendrometer bands are then fitted to the trees at this height. Each dendrometer band has two small holes punched in the band, around the point at which the band begins to overlap itself. A stainless steel spring holds the band snugly around the tree. The distance between the two holes is measured with a digital caliper at least once annually, in late October or November, and the annual increase in tree circumference is calculated by subtracting the reading during the previous autumn from the current reading. This circumference increase is converted to a diameter increase, with the assumption that the tree is circular in cross-section. Allometric equations (see data set HF 069-16) are used to calculate a dry aboveground biomass estimate for each tree in each year, from the diameter at 1.25 m. Carbon is assumed to form 50% of dry aboveground biomass. Cicrular plots of 6 m radius were established at distances of 50, 100, 150 and 200 m from the Harvard Forest Hemlock eddy flux tower in March 2001, along transects with compass bearings from 180 to 315 degrees, by 15 degree increments. Tree diameters within the plots were measured and dendrometer bands were fitted to all trees greater than 15 cm diameter at breast height. Dendrometer band measurements to calculate circumferential increase were made several times per year during 2001 and 2002 and once to twice annually thereafter. Tree mortality was also noted. Near the Little Prospect Hill (LPH) flux tower, circular plots of 6 m radius were established at distances of 50, 100, and 150 m from the flux tower in March 2002, along transects with compass bearings of 195 to 330 degrees. Plots with a larger radius of 9 m were established at 200 m, 300 m and later 400 m along the same transects. (Plots at greater distances were larger owing to larger tree sizes and lower stem density at these distances.) In late 2003, new plots were established along a transect at a 345 degree compass bearing from the tower, and measurements were discontinued on plots with 195 and 210 degree compass bearings from the tower. This change was made because examination of eddy flux data from 2002 and 2003 showed that valid carbon exchange measurements could not be obtained with wind directions below 215 degrees, and since aboveground biomass estimates were designed primarily for comparison with eddy flux measurements, biomass increments at 195 and 210 degrees were not useful. Dendrometer band installation and measurements at plots near the LPH tower was similar to those at hemlock."

00080-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Q/A-Q/C from 2009 to Present Beginning in 2009, Data were imported into Matlab as raw DAT files. Using Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) data toolbox created by GCE Information Manager Wade Sheldon, data were plotted and examined for irregularities. To assist in flagging irregular data, 'bounds' were created for the data. If data exceeded these pre-defined bounds, then the data were flagged for further scrutiny. Note that flagged data does not necessarily mean the data is bad, just that it exceeds 'normal' values and should be examined further. The following criteria were used to flag data: airtemp – If temperature >40°C or <-40°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-30°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilt05 – If temperature >40°C or <-30°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-20°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilt20 – If temperature >40°C or <-20°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-10°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilt50 – If temperature >40°C or <-20°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-15°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilmois – If soil moisture >0.7 or <0.01, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if soil moisture >0.6 or <0.05, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) Overall Field Collection Method All variables are collected with a Campbell Scientific, Inc. automated data logger - Model CR10. Air temperature and relative humidity sensors (Campbell Model 207) are exposed approximately 1.3 m above the forest floor. Soil temperature sensors are buried at 5 cm, 20 cm, and 50 cm below the soil-leaf litter interface by inserting sensor into the undisturbed sidewall of a small pit. Soil temperatures were originally collected with Model 107 thermistor sensors, later replaced with thermocouples constructed from 18 gage copper-constantan wire. Soil temperature sensors at 50 cm were added October, 2000. Water content measurements at the Top (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) and Bottom (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) commenced March 1999. Stored data are copied from the logger approximately every 14-30 days. After 2001, relative humidity, air temperature, and soil temperature manual observations were discontinued.

If discrepancies of >2 degrees C occur, the thermometer is replaced. Following this, if the discrepancy continues, the sensor is replaced. Soil Temperature: Soil temperatures recorded using thermocouples wired to a datalogger are compared to readings taken using a REOTEMP soil thermometer. Because these measurements cannot be taken in exactly the same location, identical temperatures are not expected. If the thermometer readings are consistently higher or lower at one location than the thermocouple measurement, the thermocouple is replaced. 1991-08-01 2015-12-31 CWT Study Site WS18 -- Watershed 18, North Carolina, USA.

00080-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Q/A-Q/C from 2009 to Present Beginning in 2009, Data were imported into Matlab as raw DAT files. Using Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) data toolbox created by GCE Information Manager Wade Sheldon, data were plotted and examined for irregularities. To assist in flagging irregular data, 'bounds' were created for the data. If data exceeded these pre-defined bounds, then the data were flagged for further scrutiny. Note that flagged data does not necessarily mean the data is bad, just that it exceeds 'normal' values and should be examined further. The following criteria were used to flag data: airtemp – If temperature >40°C or <-40°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-30°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilt05 – If temperature >40°C or <-30°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-20°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilt20 – If temperature >40°C or <-20°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-10°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilt50 – If temperature >40°C or <-20°C, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if temperature >30°C or <-15°C, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) soilmois – If soil moisture >0.7 or <0.01, then flagged as 'I' (Impossible); if soil moisture >0.6 or <0.05, then flagged as 'Q' (Questionable) Overall Field Collection Method All variables are collected with a Campbell Scientific, Inc. automated data logger - Model CR10. Air temperature and relative humidity sensors (Campbell Model 207) are exposed approximately 1.3 m above the forest floor. Soil temperature sensors are buried at 5 cm, 20 cm, and 50 cm below the soil-leaf litter interface by inserting sensor into the undisturbed sidewall of a small pit. Soil temperatures were originally collected with Model 107 thermistor sensors, later replaced with thermocouples constructed from 18 gage copper-constantan wire. Soil temperature sensors at 50 cm were added October, 2000. Water content measurements at the Top (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) and Bottom (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) commenced March 1999. Stored data are copied from the logger approximately every 14-30 days. After 2001, relative humidity, air temperature, and soil temperature manual observations were discontinued.

If discrepancies of >2 degrees C occur, the thermometer is replaced. Following this, if the discrepancy continues, the sensor is replaced. Soil Temperature: Soil temperatures recorded using thermocouples wired to a datalogger are compared to readings taken using a REOTEMP soil thermometer. Because these measurements cannot be taken in exactly the same location, identical temperatures are not expected. If the thermometer readings are consistently higher or lower at one location than the thermocouple measurement, the thermocouple is replaced. 1991-08-01 2015-12-31 CWT Study Site WS18 -- Watershed 18, North Carolina, USA.

The current interdisciplinary research integrates ecological and socioeconomic components across 54,000 km2 of the southern Appalachian Mountains, a biogeophysical and socioeconomic region in which evolutionary and historical processes converge (Whittaker 1956, Markusen 1987, Barnes 1991, Kretzschmar et al. 1993, Bailey 1996). Our research objective in 2002-2008 is to advance scientific understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years. Our guiding hypothesis is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to socioeconomic and biogeophysical conditions with consequences that cascade through ecosystems.

Bottles were rinsed three times and filled from the bottom, overflowing three volumes while taking care not to entrain any bubbles. Samples were fixed with MnCl2 and NaOH/NaI and stored at room temperature for up to 3 days prior to analysis. Four replicate 10 ml iodate standards were run every 3-4 days.

00082-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Lichens fix carbon dioxide from the air to build biomass. Crustose and foliose lichens grow as nearly flat, circular disks. While smaller lichens grow slowly, but with small, steady increases in radial growth rates, larger lichens grow more quickly, with radial velocities that remain roughly constant over the lifetime of an individual. These basic features follow directly from a novel mathematical model based on the diffusion of carbon dioxide around a lichen, and its absorption by the thallus. Smaller lichens fix carbon dioxide across the entire thallus, but larger lichens fix carbon dioxide disproportionately at edges. Because local edges remain the primary source of carbon as a lichen grows ever larger, radial growth rates remain constant. Predicted growth dynamics depend on four measurable parameters, and tests of the model against data suggest the model provides an accurate, robust, and universal framework for understanding the growth dynamics of lichens in nature."

A 0.0 m contour is based on a shoreline survey of the frozen moat, and therefore is closer to piezometric water level than to top surface of floating permanent ice. Deeper contours are based on piezometric water level. Thus volume calculations within the ice cover represent volumes of liquid water as if the ice was melted.Â  Â  Third order polynomial equations were fit to the area vs. depth data both from Schmok's report and from the digitized map data, using SigmaPlot's curve fitting routine. However, since the contour data are already a 'best-fit' of measured depth data, and contour intervals are relatively small, it was decided to linearly interpolate the depth:area Â relationships for depths between the measured depth contours, at 0.5m intervals. Volume was Â calculated for each 0.5m increment as a truncated cone Â (V=(h/3)*(A1+A2+sqrt(A1*A2))."

Twenty-five evenly spaced holes within the plot were sampled for each point frame for which the height and species was recorded for each leaf, stem, or plant that intersected the pin when lowered perpendicular to the ground. Non-woody species were grouped into functional groups (e.g. forb, graminoid, moss) and not identified to species. Stem diameter and the length of gramminoid blades were also recorded."

00084-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We preferentially selected tall shrub canopies dominated either by Betula nana or Salix pulchra, that is canopies that were greater than 75 cm height. Care was taken to select fairly uniform canopies, that is avoiding the edge of a shrub stand or areas where the canopy had a large gaps, suggesting the area may have been disturbed. We used point frames constructed from a 1.1 m x 1.1 m aluminum square with holes in each corner to accomodate steel rod posts used as the legs of the point frame. In this way, the frame could rest upon the four leg posts that had been hammered into the ground and remain adjustable in each corner. The frame had a level on each side, and great care was taken to ensure that the frame was (a) unable to be pushed deeper into the ground and, (b) level on all four sides prior to taking measurements. These factors were important to the measurement to have accurate data regarding the distance from the frame and the overall height of each point sampled in the canopy. The aluminum frame had numbered, regularly spaced holes on two opposite sides in order to accomodate a metal bar that could be placed across the frame and locked into place. [These holes on the frame are the row numbers.] The bar that was placed across the frame similarly had numbered, evenly spaced holes in order to accomodate a pin--a long (100-200cm) metal rod with a diameter of ~3.175 mm. [The holes on this bar are the pin hole numbers.] Measurements were only ever taken from odd row numbers, and alternated even/odd pin hole numbers with each row; in this way, for every plot 25 evenly spaced locations were sampled covering an area of one square meter. The length of the pin was marked every half-centimeter so that the distance could be read easily. Measurements were made by lowering the pin through a pin hole and, once encountering a leaf or stem, recording the following: row#, pin hole#, hit#, and the species hit. If the object hit was not a leaf, the plant tissue was noted; the diameter of each stem hit was estimated in millimeters, and the length of every graminoid blade hit was recorded from the point at which it was hit to the tip. As the primary species of interest for this project were for a select number of species (B. nana, S. pulchra, S. glauca, S. reticulata, V. uliginosum, V. vitis, L. palustre), species that were not the target of interest were classified as functional groups--e.g. graminoid spp., forb, moss. The last pin-hit recorded for each pin hole was always at the &quot;soil&quot; which was considered to be the transition between the green and brown plant material, often in a mossy layer. These data can be used in conjunction with the other data collected from these same plots--leaf area index, light and A-Ci response curves of shoots taken at different segments of the canopy."

00086-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Plot location was chosen based on dominate vegetation type (T or W). The tussock tundra plots are located near the Moist Acidic Tundra plots characterized by Shaver and Chapin (1991). The wet sedge plots are located near the outlet of Toolik Lake; all plots have been used by the Arctic LTER project at Toolik Lake. In wet sedge tundra, three 1 m2-sized plots were positioned randomly in each of two treatments of block 2 of the LTER wet sedge scheme (outlet site), control and N+P-fertilized , respectively, in 2000. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N at one of three different dates of the summer season 2001. In moist acidic tussock tundra six 1 m2 sized plots were positioned in three of the &quot;X&quot; (=extra&quot;) blocks of the LTER scheme, in 2001, inside an area extending 5 m from the boardwalks and, positioning plots so that similar area shares between tussocks and intertussock areas was achieved. In each of the three X blocks two 1m2-sized plots were established. The whole 5 m area of the X blocks extending from the board walks was divided into two halfs, each containing one of the 1m2 sized plots. One half was set aside as the control and the other half was designated to be fertilized. Fertilization with a Hoagland solution (see protocol) started in late summer 2001, and was repeated annually after that , early in the summer season. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N of the summer season 2002; all three pairs were labelled as closely together in time as logistically possible. 1. Dissolved Gas Sampling Description: Using soil sampling needles and a 60 mL syringe, we pulled 40 mL of bubble-free water out of the ground. We then pulled 20 mL of ambient air and vigorously shook the syringe for 2-3 minutes. After the shaking period, the gases in the headspace should be in equilibrium with the dissolved gas content. We transfered ~10-15 mL of the headspace air into a nylong, airtight syringe. The syringes were returned to the laboratory at the Toolik Field Station and were ran on a Shimadzu model 14A gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) to determine CO2 and CH4 gas pressure, respectively. The sample chromatogram peak area was converted to concentration based on a standard curve (Kling et al. 2000). 2. Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) Sampling Description: Using soil sampling needles and a 60 mL syringe, we pulled 20 mL of bubble-free water out of the ground. The water was transferred into a 20 mL serum bottles capped with aluminum capped teflon septa. We added 0.2 mL of Mercuric Chloride to preserve the sample. Samples were returned to the University of Michigan, the samples were acidified to convert all inorganic carbon to carbon dioxide, and the dissolved carbon dioxide was ran on a Shimadzu model 14A gas chromatograph using a TCD detector (Stainton 1973).

A spectrophotometer is used to quantify color in the lab as absorbance (unitless) at 1 nm intervals between the wavelengths of 200 and 800 nm (Note: Prior to August 2008, samples were initially run in 10cm cuvettes. Starting in Aug 2008, samples are initially run in 5cm cuvettes. Absorbance data are considered suspect for values greater than 2. Lakes with suspect data (typically, the bog lakes) are re-analyzed in the 200-400 nm range in 1 cm cuvettes. The data values are linear with respect to cuvette size. I.e, data from the 1cm cuvettes should be multiplied by 5 to be comparable with 5cm cuvette data and multiplied by 10 to be comparable with 10cm cuvette data. Data from 5cm cuvettes should be multiplied by 2 to be comparable with the older 10cm cuvette data. Sampling Frequency: 4 times annually Number of sites: 7"

The samples are surface water, filtered in the field through 0.45u polycarbonate membrane filters. We run a wavelength scan from 800 to 200nm, using a 5cm rectangular quartz cell in a Beckman Coulter Model DU800 spectrophotometer. Any samples that display absorbance values above 2AU are run again from 400 to 200nm using a 1cm quartz cuvette. Inititally the full range of wavelengths were run again and two values may be found in the database even if the original measurement with the large cuvette did not exceed 2AU. The user should discard values above 2AU and use values from the smaller cuvette instead. All values are given as measurements at the path lenth of the employed cuvette and need to be devided by the cuvette length for a comparable value at a pathlength of 1 cm. The single beam Beckman Coulter DU800 spec is blanked first on a sample of DI water. Additional blank values are from a scan run on DI after that blanking as a check and are reported alongside the scans but are not subtracted from the scan values. Protocol Log: 1990 -- we began running color scans, using a 10cm cylindrical cell with a Kontron spectrophotometer. 2001 -- we added scans in a 1cm cell for samples with high absorbance. July 2008 -- changed to Beckman Coulter DU800 spectrophotometer. At same time changed from 10cm to 5cm cell."

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

00088-metadata.xml,Project Description,/eml:eml/dataset/project,"Plum Island Ecosystems Long-Term Ecological Research (PIE LTER) Program Anne Giblin The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7488 agiblin@mbl.edu Lead PI Hap Garritt The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7485 pie_im@mbl.edu Information Manager The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER is an integrated research, education and outreach program whose goal is to develop a predictive understanding of the long-term response of watershed and estuarine ecosystems at the land-sea interface to changes in climate, land use and sea level. The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

00089-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design/Sampling Description: Weather data at Toolik Lake has been collected by the Arctic LTER since June 1988. The station is located about 50 meters south of the lake&#039;s edge in a sedge/moss (Tomenthypnum nitens-Carex bigelowii) vegetation. Sensors that are measured every minute and averaged or totaled every hour include: air temperature and relative humidity at 1 and 5 meters, wind speed at 1 and 5 meters, wind direction at 5 meters, global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, barometric pressure, and precipitation. Sensors measured every 10 minutes and averaged every three hours include: soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, and evaporation pan depth and pan water temperature. Pan evaporation are only measured during the summer months. The hourly data are in the file yyyyDLTLH.DAT, the three hourly data are in yyyyDLTLO.DAT, and daily summaries are in yyyyDLTLD.DAT. A second datalogger about 700 meters from the main weather station logs air and soil temperatures and photosynthetically active radiation in the experimental treatment plots. Treatments include greenhouse, shading, and fertilization. In the control plot wind speed and direction, global solar radiation and unfrozen precipitation are also measured. This station is also used as a backup to the main weather station. The full description of the sensors and site is in file SENSORS.DOC. The original data is in file yyyyDLTDAT.ZIP which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. NOTES AND COMMENTS: Lake temperature is measured at the lake depth measurement. Soil temperatures consist of two profiles in a moss dominated plant community. They are within 3 meters of the weather station. . See additional notes under Comments variable Data was lost during the winter of (2005-2006 31Dec05 â€“ 20Apr06) when a storage module filled up."

00090-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Metadata for BES site - Stream Temperature: Baisman Run (BARN): In the Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, BES) we use the watershed approach to evaluate integrated ecosystem function. The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Baisman Run at Ivy Hill Road. This is a 381 ha, 80% forested watershed with unsewered residential land use in the headwaters. A detailed description of this site is posted at: http://md.water.usgs.gov/BES/01589352/ Streamflow data for this site are posted at: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/md/nwis/nwisman?site_no=01589352 Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a forested/reference catchment. Theme keywords: stream, watershed, temperature, forested, reference, Baltimore Ecosystem Study Coordinates: Lat/Long 39.4795 (39 28 46) (-)76.6780 (-76 40 41) Review process for BES stream temperature data: Raw data were recorded and logged every 2-minutes using HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001. Data are exported into Microsoft Excel documents. Then organized by site and by month Each month's data were entered into a pivot table in Microsoft Excel and daily means and counts of daily data points were calculated. Plots were graphed of sites with close geographic proximity on the same graph to illustrate possible outlier data. Missing and odd data were flagged, and notes taken from the field visits are provided where applicable."

00091-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In 1988 and 1990, the U.S. Geological Survey, Lawrence, KS, drilled 35 wells at 16 sites within the N04D watershed at the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area. The wells range in depth from about 2 to 13 meters, and are nested to include wells completed in alluvium/colluvium near the N04D drainage and in two Permian-aged limestone’s. These sites comprise four transects running approximately east-west across the drainage, and occupy the lower 10% of the surface area of the watershed. The geology of the area is characterized by patchy, near-stream alluvium/colluvium which overlies bedrock, composed of thin (1-2 meter) limestones alternating with thicker (2-4 meter) shales. The limestones are fractured, and records of water levels in the wells show that in some parts of the watershed water levels are nearly constant, while in others they respond noticeably to precipitation events. Beginning in 1991, water samples for inorganic chemical analysis have been collected every four to six weeks by bailing wells to remove 1-2 well volumes. A bailed sample is then filtered through 0.45µ membrane filters by gravity feed. One 50-mL aliquot is reserved for alkalinity determination by titration with 0.02 N H2SO4. One 250-mL LDPE bottle is filled with 250 mL of sample and 5 mL of concentrated HNO3 for cation analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Na, K, Ca, Mg). One 250-mL LDPE bottle is filled to the brim for anion analysis by ion chromatography (Cl, SO4, NO3). The latter two samples are stored on ice and later in a refrigerator. Anion determination is completed within 1 to 3 days of collection."

00092-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"We use metacommunity simulations to understand how local and regional community assembly dynamics influence the regional biodiversity patterns that we observe in the McMurdo Dry Valleys ecosystem. A metacommunity refers to a network of communities in an ecosystem that are connected to one another by the dispersal of biota among sites. For example, ponds in the McMurdo Dry Valleys share common diatom species that are likely dispersed among neighboring ponds by wind. We have written a metacommunity model for the R programming language (MCSim,Â Sokol et al. 2015) to explore what biodiversity patterns look like for different metacommunity connectivity scenarios. This gives us the opportunity to model alternative hypotheses and explore how biodiversity metrics, such as beta-diversity, can be expected to respond to changing ecosystem connectivity for different sets of assumptions about the underlying dynamics that could potentially control biodiversity in the Dry Valleys.Â "

00092-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field Sample Analysis and Model Approach We are parameterizing metacommunity simulations by using observational data collected across various MCM core experiments to characterize local habitat characteristics and the composition of biotic communities in aquatic and terrestrial habitats. For example, we have modeled different metacommunity scenariosÂ based on the diatom communities observed in microbial mats sampled in ponds on Ross Island and in the McMurdo Dry Valleys (observational data described inÂ Sakaeva et al. 2016). For each pond, we have measured a suite of environmental variables (e.g., pH, conductivity, nutrient concentrations) and recorded GPS locations. Similar to the modeling approach described by Sokol et al. (2015), we use the pond GPS coordinates to create a network of ponds in 2-dimensional space for the metacommunity simulations. We use the first axis of a principal component analysis (PCA) of pond environmental variables to create a composite environmentalÂ variable, used to characterize the local habitat at each pond in a simulation scenario. Diatom counts from cores collected from microbial mats from each pond wereÂ used to set the initial metacommunity conditions for all simulation scenarios. Similarly, we are also using this approach to understand the importance of connectivityÂ for biodiversity data collected in nematode and soil bacteria studies at the MCM LTER.Â  Â  Modeling code used: MCSim for the R statistical language.

00093-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Patterns of biodiversity, such as the increase toward the tropics and the peaked curve during ecological succession, are fundamental phenomena for ecology. Such patterns have multiple, interacting causes, but temperature emerges as a dominant factor across organisms from microbes to trees and mammals, and across terrestrial, marine, and freshwater environments. However, there is little consensus on the underlying mechanisms, even as global temperatures increase and the need to predict their effects becomes more pressing. The purpose of this project is to generate and test theory for how temperature impacts biodiversity through its effect on biochemical processes and metabolic rate. A combination of standardized surveys in the field and controlled experiments in the field and laboratory measure diversity of three taxa -- trees, invertebrates, and microbes -- and key biogeochemical processes of decomposition in seven forests distributed along a geographic gradient of increasing temperature from cold temperate to warm tropical. This data set captures abundance of OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) sampled for in forest soils at the original six sampling sites (HJ Andrews, Niwot, Harvard Forest, Coweeta, Luquillo, Barro Colorado Island) plus the new site set up by the Enquist Lab at Mt. Bigelow near Tucson, AZ. This data represents abundance of 16S (bacteria) genes in soil samples processed by the University of Oklahoma Institute for Environmental Genomics as part of a macrosystems biodiversity and latitude project supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement DEB#1065836."

00093-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"An array of 21 1m2 subplots was used to sample leaf litter invertebrates and soil microbes at each experimental site. The subplots were directed 1m, 10m, 50m, 100m and 200m from a central subplot where the '1m' plots shared an edge with the central subplot. The leaf litter and litter soil interface were sifted and placed in berlese funnel extractors for 48 hours, with litter invertebrates extracted into 95% ethanol. Within each 1m2 plot, 9 soil cores (2cm diameter, ~8cm depth) were taken with all 9 pooled and mixed. The Genetics Lab then analyzed the soil samples as follows: To determine the biodiversity of microbial communities, three genes targeting different taxonomic groups with different taxonomic resolutions were sequenced: The first of these are the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes for determining the biodiversity of bacteria and archaea. All of the target genes were amplified and sequenced to a great depth using Illumina MiSeq. An average of 64K sequence reads were obtained for the 16S gene. The numbers of OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) obtained varied considerably (1.6-5.8 times) based on different sequence similarity thresholds. Such sequencing efforts appear to be reasonably sufficient to estimate the diversity of the microbial communities examined, at least for the dominant populations, as indicated by rarefaction analysis, which showed that the rarefaction curves approached to saturation at different cutoffs for the three target genes."

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

Input values and wind alignment looks good.Â  No ultrasonic at site, but station is still programed for measurement. 2. GPS: 78.10115, 163.78778 3. Station maintenance on 11/28/2012: power off to add additional 100 amp hr battery and new style regulator. SwappedÂ  Omni antenna for Yagi antenna. Swapped SM at 13:45. 4. Post-processing: Processed with telemetry data. Delete first line of data. One line missing data from station visit 11/28/2012 at 13:30, multiple repetitive lines of data were deleted between 1/3/13 and 1/9/13, no missing data during this period. Â  Notes 2013 - Basagic Â  1. Station visit on 11/21/2013 at 12:45 by Basagic, Cronin, and Doran. Datalogger date and time are correct. Input values and wind alignment looks good. No ultrasonic at site, but station is still programed for measurement. Â  2. Station maintenance on 11/21/2013: Swapped up facing pyranometer (old: PY28370; new: PY28169) at 13:45. swapped down facing pyranometer (old: PY18656; new PY23250) at 13:15, and quantum (old: Q9916, new:Q30803) at 13:30.Â  Â  3. Post-processing: Processed with telemetry data. Delete last line of data in SM01. No sonic ranger, all data flagged as missing. One line of missing data on August 30, 2013 (242) at 19:30. Air pressure data looks suspect. Winter battery low was 12.2v.Â  Â  On Oct 2014, Inigo splitted the GADM tables into MISM and GADM to reflect the different locations of the data streams.

Bacterial production is determined by the incorporation of 14C labeled Leucine (Simon and Azam 1989) in triplicate water samples incubated in the dark at in situ temperature for 1-3 hours (typically 2 hrs). Water samples are vacuum filtered through 0.22 um Millapore GS cellulose nitrate filters. Samples are extracted with 5mL of 5% TCA for 5 minutes, rinsed with additional TCA, and air dried in mini-scintillation vials. Following the addition of 1 mL cellosolve (ethylene glycol monoethyl ether), filters are left to dissolve overnight. Scinti-safe scintillation cocktail (4 mL) is then added to each vial and samples are counted at Toolik Field Station on a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR) .Calculations of bacterial productivity assume that the Internal Dilution (ID) of leucine is 1, but studies show it may range from 1-2 (Kirchman 1993). Some published data from these LTER files have used an ID value different than 1; in those studies, the ID value used is stated in the article.1. Simon, M., and F. Azam. 1989.

Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column."

00098-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Weather data has been collected at Toolik Lake (68 degrees 38&#039;N, 149 degrees 36&#039;W) by a Campbell 21x datatlogger since June 1988. Sensors that are measured every minute and averaged or totaled every hour include; air temperature and relative humidity at 1 and 5 meters, wind speed at 1 and 5 meters, wind direction at 5 meters, global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, net radiation (Fritschen type), barometric pressure, and unfrozen precipitation. Sensors measured every 10 minutes and averaged every three hours include; soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, and evaporation pan depth and pan water temperature. Net radiation and pan evaporation are only measured during the summer months. The hourly data are in the file 91DLTLH.DAT, the three hourly data are in 91DLTLO.DAT, and daily summaries are in 91DLTLD.DAT. A second Campbell 21x datalogger about 700 meters from the main weather station logs air and soil temperatures and photosynthetically active radiation in the experimental treatment plots. Treatments include greenhouse, shading, and fertilization. In the control plot wind speed and direction, global solar radiation and unfrozen precipitation are also measured. This station is also used as a backup to the main weather station. The full description of the sensors and site is in file SENSORS.DOC. The original data is in file 91DLTDAT.ZIP, which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. Notes: Wind speed less than .447 is considered calm. The datalogger stopped collecting data during winter of 1990-91. Data from January to April are estimated from a nearby station, the Tussock station.

00099-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This drying and warming experiment addresses the following questions: 1) Does ecosystem drying, warming and permafrost thaw cause a net release or uptake of C from the ecosystem to the atmosphere?, 2) Does the decomposition of old C that comprises the bulk of the soil C pool influence ecosystem C loss? 3) How do drying and warmign affect plant communities and ecosystem properties? We are answering these questions using a combined warming and drying experiment (DryPEHR), which is situated with the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project and located in an upland tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. Warming treatment here refers to growing season air temperature warming (~1C) using open top chambers (OTC) combined with soil 'warming' using snow fences during the snow covered months. Drying is achieve using an automated pumping system that lowers the water table in the dry plots. Soil warming began in 2008; OTCs and drying in 2011. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was measured using a specialized handheld camera at individual plots throughout the 2011-2015 growing seasons."

'NIR' refers to reflected near infrared light and 'vis' refers to reflected visible light. A correction factor (NDVI_correction) was applied to data processed before 2015 because changed to Pixelwrench software in 2015 increased NDVI values by approximately 0.309. We determined this offset by processing pre-2015 images using 2015 software and by processing 2015 images using pre-2015 software. There was no seasonal bias in this offset. We decided to correct pre-2015 NDVI values so that future data would not have to be corrected. Corrected NDVI values were at this site were also found to be similar to NDVI from MODIS for this site and so we feel this correction is justified. LAB: No specific lab methods recorded.
