00000-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Ammonia volatilization was measured at three sites in the Chihuahuan Desert of southern New Mexico, U.S.A. In dry soils, ammonia volatilization ranged from 9 to 11 micrograms of nitrogen per square meter per day, but rates increased to 95 micrograms of nitrogen per square meter per day in a shrubland site after an experimental addition of water. Ammonia volatilization also increased with experimental additions of NH4Cl and decreased with additions of sucrose. Competition by nitrifiers for available NH4+ had little effect on NH3 volatilization: N-Serve, added to inhibit nitrification, decreased NH3 volatilization in a grassland site and had little effect at other sites. We suggest that NH3 volatilization is controlled by the rate of mineralization of NH4+ from soil organic matter, and mineralization is stimulated by rainfall. Overall rates of NH3 volatilization from undisturbed desert ecosystems appear to be much lower than those reported for rangeland and agricultural soils. Data set shows ammonia volatilization from the grassland soils at the base of Mount Summerford in response to a variety of experimental treatments chosen to elucidate the processes controlling the volatilization rate. Ammonia is collected in weak acid in scintillation vials placed inside PVC chambers in the field. The rate of ammonia volatilization per unit area (ugN/m2/day) is found by multiplying the concentration in the acid by 1250."

The experimental plots were established at three sites along the desert Long Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) transect that crosses the alluvial piedmont of Mount Summerford in the Dona Ana Mountains. One site was located in a grassland dominated by Bouteloua eriopoda in the upper reaches of the piedmont. A second site was in a mid-slope position in a shrubland dominated by Larrea tridentata, an invasive desert species. The third site was located in an ephemeral dry lake, or playa, dominated by Panicum obtusum, at the base of the piedmont."

Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

Water and N-serve were applied as in 1988. C2H2 was applied by covering these tubes with a PVC cap and injecting 30 ml C2H2 into the headspace through a rubber septum. The volume was chosen to greatly exceed the 10 Pa level, which is found, in short-term exposures, to cause a persistent inhibition of nitrification in soils (Berg et al., 1982; Hyman and Wood, 1985). The syringe was pumped several times to ensure mixing of the C2H2 into the soil pore space. After 10 min the cap was removed, and all tubes were allowed to equilibrate in the field for 24 h.

When the detecting stations are 50 miles apart, estimated strike locations are usually within 1/2 to 1 kilometer of the actual location.

Instrument locations were first geocoded using the station descriptions from each network. Daily measurements were then aggregated to bi-weekly periods (maxium of all maxima and minimum of all minima during each period) to match the temporal resolution of MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites designed for global monitoring of key biophysical parameters including vegetation. Tables with aggregated temperature were then joined to the shapefile of meteorological stations. Spatial interpolation Temperature was gridded in two steps. First, I converted actual observations into hypothetical air temperature near land surface at 0 m above sea level (ASL) by applying a 6.5 K/km environmental lapse rate, which is the international standard set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Second, I used Geostatistical Analyst, the ArcGIS 9.1 extensio and performed ordinary kriging to produce a horizontal temperature distribution at 0 ASL. Standard Error maps were also produced along with temperature surfaces that were all rasterized to a 250 meter resolution grid. Final grids were created by using a digital elevation model (DEM) resampled to 250 meters and inverting the environmental lapse rate to the previously interpolated temperature surface. Temporal aggregations Biweekly temperature surfaces were aggregated to monthly time step (again maxium of the corresponding two maxima and minimum of the two minima).

00003-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Benthic primary production in Florida Bay is mainly driven by mangroves, seagrass, peryphiton, and macroalgae. The nutrient dynamics and salinity regimes at Florida Bay are strongly influenced by marine waters from the Gulf of Mexico, oceanic waters from the Atlantic Ocean and fresh waters from the Everglades creating a complex estuary with oligohaline ecotones. Marine and groundwater are sources of P and are expected to decline with increased freshwater inflow (Childers et al. 2006a; Price et al. 2006). The Taylor Slough ecotone, (TS/Ph), which flows into the Bay, is characterized by small tidal influence and clear seasonal variability in water source and quality (Davis et al. 2003; Sutula et al. 2001), receives P from shallow groundwater inputs (Price et al. 2006).Therefore the amount of freshwater inputs from the Everglades will affect salinity, water residence times, and the sources, availability, and flux of organic and inorganic nutrients on Florida Bay. As a consequence gradients of N and P concentrations are characteristic in the Bay with expected low concentration of P and high N on the fresh water end, contrasting with higher levels of P and lower of N towards the marine section of the Bay. This gradient in P concentrations is expected to reflect in differences in both primary production and biomass along the TS/Ph ecotone. One of the Everglades LTER scientist general hypothesis is 'that increasing inputs of freshwater will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone' (LTER program). In this context we expect to have a differential production of calcareous macroalgae along the TS-Ph transect which reflect the P gradient with low productivity towards the fresh water influenced sites close to the Everglades increasing towards the marine section of the Bay. We document the primary production of calcareous green macroalgae along the TS-Ph transect including three contrasting environments at Florida Bay. The transect include site TS-Ph 9 located near Duck Key in oligotrophic northeastern Florida Bay; TS-Ph 10 is located near Bob Allen Keys in the oligotrophic center Florida Bay and TS-Ph 11 is located near Sprigger Bank at the western open boundary between Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico.In order to survey the temporal and spatial variability in production of calcareous marine macroalgae, a monitoring survey was started in 2007 on the three TS-Ph transect. In each site 3 hazard selected quadrats were sampled for biomass, CaCO3 production and species ID, and abundance using Braun Blanquet Index. Surveys are conducted bimonthly.Results show a significant difference on production with a high abundance and biomass at Sprigger Bank (Ts-Ph11) compared with lower values at Bob Allan Key and Duck Key. Seasonal changes show a higher production in summer compared with winter periods. The long term trend shows a decline on production in Sprigger Bank. Thalli CaCO3 content has a linear relation with biomass (carbon content) indicating a constant relationship between CaCO3 fixation and algae size-biomass. As a general trend we document a higher calcareous green macroalgae production towards the marine sites, consistent with the fact that the TS-Ph transect shows an enhanced productivity in the TS/Ph toward the marine end of the Bay (Fourqurean et al., 1992). A decline in calcareous green macroalgae at Sprigger Bank is reported based on 4 years of survey, which might have consequences on sand production for this site, moreover this will eventually change the sediment characteristics of this site. Our long term data set is a base line that will allow us detect potential changes in CaCO3 fixation by calcareous green macroalgae as a consequence of predicted acidification of the oceans."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00004-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"We collected monthly observations of water microbial characteristics from each of the FCE LTER sites beginning in February 2001. Bacteria counts using DAPI epifluorescence, heterotrophic bacteria production with tritiated Thymidine uptake, and algal energetics and chl a using the PAM fluorometer were determined from each of the water samples. Bacteria counts in Shark River Slough in the freshwater end of the transect revealed highest bacteria numbers upon marsh rewetting after the dry down. The highest overall count of bacteria was found at the most freshwater point adjacent to the perimeter of the water conservation area but only in March of 2001. Peak numbers of bacteria in the saline end of Shark River transect occurred in December and July. There is some evidence that these higher bacteria numbers in the SR transect are associated with higher salinities. Highest bacteria counts along the Taylor slough transect were observed at the mouth of the Taylor River with peak counts in the wet season in October. Bacteria densities also increased from the eastern to western end of the transect in Florida Bay. Heterotrophic bacterial production did not relate closely bacteria numbers and exhibited highest numbers in the dry season. There was no discernible relationship between salinity and bacteria production as seen in bacteria numbers. Monthly observations using PAM fluorometry revealed that brown algae was the greatest contribution to the algal chal a pool and this relationship was consistent across all FCE LTER sites. Converse to the pattern of bacteria abundance along the Shark River transect, there was evidence that algal biomass decreases from freshwater to estuary. In the Shark River, algal energetics increased from marsh to estuary as well as in the panhandle region of the Taylor River transect. From these observations we conclude the behavior of the microbial loop and interactions generated between functional guilds is highly variable along individual transects and between the Shark River and Taylor River transect. Wet dry season dynamics partially explain temporal variability in microbial dynamics along the individual transects yet responses were unique for each section of the transect as freshwater versus estuarine versus Bay. Relationships between salinity and microbial parameters in this case, were not easily discerned but were more consistent within the two river transects than between river transects."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

The network includes monthly sampling at stations in Rookery Bay, Estero Bay, Pine Island Sound, Florida Bay, Whitewater Bay, the Shark Slough estuaries, Biscayne Bay, Southwest Florida Shelf, and the Ten Thousand Islands. Florida International University shall provide a Quality Assurance (QA) Program for the network to ensure that the data generated are accurate, representative of actual conditions, and that a quantifiable measure of confidence can be established.No information at this timeBiscayne Bay, Florida Bay & Whitewater Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, and Marco-Pine Island Sound are sampled monthly, while the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Southwest Florida Shelf are sampled quarterly.-81.615-80.37525.9324.8672002-10-012006-09-30Microbial dynamics and DOM cycling in FCE LTER sitesJosephBoyerSoutheast Environmental Research CenterAssociate DirectorSoutheast Environmental Research CenterFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkOE 148MiamiFL33199USA305-348-4076305-348-4096boyerj@fiu.eduLead Principal InvestigatorMicrobial Surveys, At all LTER sites we quantify phytoplankton biomass and productivity by coupling PAR measurements with pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry. In this technique, a rapid series of high frequency flashes permits measurement of the absorption cross section of Photosystem II (quantum yield), the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, the level of photochemical quenching, and the concentration of chlorophyll a. At these same sites we enumerate bacteria using DAPI epifluorescent microscopy and determine bacterial productivity using 3H-thymidine uptake experiments. We compare algal:bacterial biomass and productivity as well as grazing rates in an effort to characterize the microbial loop.DOM Bioavailability Assays: We conduct biomass leaching experiments (abiotic) to characterize the DOM generated by specific sources. Results of such end-member experiments are then applied in the field. We conduct bioavailability assays on ambient and leached DOM using 16 day incubations. We quantified loss of the DOM (DOC, DON) fraction as well as the chemical characteristics. The assays are designed to quantify the effect of nutrient additions on DOM degradation and are conducted with an ambient control. Shark River Surveys: Biannual sampling events of the Shark River estuary in the Everglades were performed in March 2001 and ended October 2002. Surveys were conducted at slack low and high tide along the salinity gradient. In addition samples were collected at a central station in the river over a 48 hour period. Variables measured included temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, total organic nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus, total organic carbon, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, turbidity, and light extinction. Algal energetics (as quantum yield) and chlorophyll a concentrations for major phytoplankton guilds (green algae, brown algae, and cyanobacteria) were quantified using a PhytoPAM fluorometer. Bacteria were quantified by direct counts using DAPI; 3H-thymidine uptake was used to measure bacterial production.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

The network includes monthly sampling at stations in Rookery Bay, Estero Bay, Pine Island Sound, Florida Bay, Whitewater Bay, the Shark Slough estuaries, Biscayne Bay, Southwest Florida Shelf, and the Ten Thousand Islands. Florida International University shall provide a Quality Assurance (QA) Program for the network to ensure that the data generated are accurate, representative of actual conditions, and that a quantifiable measure of confidence can be established.No information at this timeBiscayne Bay, Florida Bay & Whitewater Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, and Marco-Pine Island Sound are sampled monthly, while the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and the Southwest Florida Shelf are sampled quarterly.-81.615-80.37525.9324.8672002-10-012006-09-30Microbial dynamics and DOM cycling in FCE LTER sitesJosephBoyerSoutheast Environmental Research CenterAssociate DirectorSoutheast Environmental Research CenterFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkOE 148MiamiFL33199USA305-348-4076305-348-4096boyerj@fiu.eduLead Principal InvestigatorMicrobial Surveys, At all LTER sites we quantify phytoplankton biomass and productivity by coupling PAR measurements with pulse amplitude modulated fluorometry. In this technique, a rapid series of high frequency flashes permits measurement of the absorption cross section of Photosystem II (quantum yield), the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, the level of photochemical quenching, and the concentration of chlorophyll a. At these same sites we enumerate bacteria using DAPI epifluorescent microscopy and determine bacterial productivity using 3H-thymidine uptake experiments. We compare algal:bacterial biomass and productivity as well as grazing rates in an effort to characterize the microbial loop.DOM Bioavailability Assays: We conduct biomass leaching experiments (abiotic) to characterize the DOM generated by specific sources. Results of such end-member experiments are then applied in the field. We conduct bioavailability assays on ambient and leached DOM using 16 day incubations. We quantified loss of the DOM (DOC, DON) fraction as well as the chemical characteristics. The assays are designed to quantify the effect of nutrient additions on DOM degradation and are conducted with an ambient control. Shark River Surveys: Biannual sampling events of the Shark River estuary in the Everglades were performed in March 2001 and ended October 2002. Surveys were conducted at slack low and high tide along the salinity gradient. In addition samples were collected at a central station in the river over a 48 hour period. Variables measured included temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, total organic nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus, total organic carbon, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, turbidity, and light extinction. Algal energetics (as quantum yield) and chlorophyll a concentrations for major phytoplankton guilds (green algae, brown algae, and cyanobacteria) were quantified using a PhytoPAM fluorometer. Bacteria were quantified by direct counts using DAPI; 3H-thymidine uptake was used to measure bacterial production.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Fifteen 9.8 cm2 cores were removed from the floating periphyton mat and composited into a single sample. Percent aerial cover of floating periphyton was estimated visually in the field. Data are presented in terms of grams dry and ash-free dry mass per area. Total phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon concentration in the periphyton mat is also presented on a dry weight basis. This is part of a continuous data collection to test the hypothesis that phosphorus and nitrogen limit productivity at the upstream and downstream ends, respectively, of the FCE transects. Conclusions await longer-term data collection."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed. Data Acknowledgment Policy: Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use. Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned: Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project.

Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed. Data Acknowledgment Policy: Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use. Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned: Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project.

00008-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data PoliciesObjectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System.

The experiement consisted of a factorial combination of four treatments with two replicates: (control (no resource addition), water (W), nitrogen (N), and nitrogen plus water (NW) additions. The eight cells of the design were contiguous plots of area 1 ha each, randomly assigned within the two blocks. Water and nitrogen fertilizer were applied from 1970 to 1974. Water was applied to maintain soil water potential at a depth of 10 cm between 0 and -.08 MPa from 1 May to 1 September (Lauenroth et al. 1978). Soil water was checked daily and, if needed, water was added at night with sprinklers. The amount of water added per year ranged from 458mm to 707 mm (Lauenroth at el. 1978). Nitrogen fertilizer (330 g/kg nitrogen as ammonium nitrate) was added to maintain a difference between the treatment and control plots of at least 50 kg/ha of soil mineral nitrogen (NO3 – and NH4+). This resulted in addition of 50-100 kg/ha of nitrogen to the nitrogen treatment plots in each of the four years. Water and nitrogen additions were stopped in 1974 and since then, the plots have been unaltered. The plots have been protected from grazing since 1968. Belowground biomass was sampled by removing a 2.2 cm diameter x 30 cm deep core from the soil immediately underneath each plant. Cores were taken from 32 individuales of each species on each plot of only one replicate of the historical treatment area. One transect was formed diagonally across each 1-ha historical treatment plot, and individual plants were chosen along the transect in a stratified, random manner at 16 locations. Root cores from two individual plants at each of the 16 locations were compositied to provide enough root material for each sample. The belowground plant material was separated from the soil with flotation method of Lauenroth and Whitman (1971), using a 0.5-mm sieve to catch fine roots. Roots were separated from culms or stem bases and all parts were dired at 55 and weighed. The roots and stem bases were milled to pass through no. 40 (0.5 mm) mesh and subsamples were ashed at 550 C."

00011-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Classification of Landsat TM Data Classification refers to several statistical techniques (or algorithms) used to sort and group data into discrete classes which can be uniquely identified. Classification algorithms are routinely used to reduce the large volume of data present in a typical TM (or other sensor) dataset to several classes that are meaningful to the investigator. There are two major types of classification algorithm applied to remotely sensed data: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised classification algorithms (such as ISODATA) cluster data according to several user-defined statistical parameters in an iterative fashion until either some percentage of pixels remain unchanged or a maximum number of iterations has been performed. This method of classification is most useful when no previous knowledge or ground truth data of an area is available. The classes determined by the algorithm still require land cover identification by an experienced analyst however, which can be a significant disadvantage to the method. The unsupervised classification technique is used for portions of the CAP LTER region for which limited ancillary data (land use, aerial photographs, zoning maps) are available (essentially the region outside of Maricopa County). Twenty (or more) classes are determined for each TM scene using the ISODATA algorithm, and these classes are assigned a land cover category on the basis of spectral signature, vegetation density, and geologic setting. These land cover classifications are considered to be preliminary pending detailed verification by ground truthing. Supervised classification algorithms rely on user-defined training regions that represent pure samples of a particular class (such as asphalt ). Several different types of supervised classification algorithms exist, but the major types are minimum distance, parallelpiped, and maximum likelihood. Minimum distance algorithms calculate a mean value in spectral space for each training region, and then compare each image pixel value to these means. The image pixel is assigned to whatever class mean it is closest in value to. The parallelpiped algorithm constructs a class volume in data space to further constrain the identification of data points as a given class. Maximum likelihood algorithms assume a Gaussian distribution of pixel values within each training class and tend to be somewhat more accurate in regions of high surficial variability. Image pixels that fall within some standard deviation of the training class mean are assigned to that class. This method has the added advantage of weighting such that image pixels are less likely to be classified as covers with low probability of occurrence in the scene. Maximum likelihood supervised classification is used for regions that have good ground truth data available, such as the Phoenix metro region. Verification of Classification Accuracy The accuracy of any classification must be assessed prior to use in scientific analysis. Accuracy assessment involves the collection of ground truth data for the classified scene. This is done by establishing a number of test pixels within the image for which the actual ground cover is determined by field inspection, use of aerial photographs, or use of some other dataset. An overall classification accuracy is then determined by dividing the number of test pixels correctly classified by the number of total test pixels. Assessment of accuracy for the CAP LTER study area is not straightforward as the major dataset available for comparison is the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) Land Use Map.

00011-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Classification of Landsat TM Data Classification refers to several statistical techniques (or algorithms) used to sort and group data into discrete classes which can be uniquely identified. Classification algorithms are routinely used to reduce the large volume of data present in a typical TM (or other sensor) dataset to several classes that are meaningful to the investigator. There are two major types of classification algorithm applied to remotely sensed data: unsupervised and supervised. Unsupervised classification algorithms (such as ISODATA) cluster data according to several user-defined statistical parameters in an iterative fashion until either some percentage of pixels remain unchanged or a maximum number of iterations has been performed. This method of classification is most useful when no previous knowledge or ground truth data of an area is available. The classes determined by the algorithm still require land cover identification by an experienced analyst however, which can be a significant disadvantage to the method. The unsupervised classification technique is used for portions of the CAP LTER region for which limited ancillary data (land use, aerial photographs, zoning maps) are available (essentially the region outside of Maricopa County). Twenty (or more) classes are determined for each TM scene using the ISODATA algorithm, and these classes are assigned a land cover category on the basis of spectral signature, vegetation density, and geologic setting. These land cover classifications are considered to be preliminary pending detailed verification by ground truthing. Supervised classification algorithms rely on user-defined training regions that represent pure samples of a particular class (such as asphalt ). Several different types of supervised classification algorithms exist, but the major types are minimum distance, parallelpiped, and maximum likelihood. Minimum distance algorithms calculate a mean value in spectral space for each training region, and then compare each image pixel value to these means. The image pixel is assigned to whatever class mean it is closest in value to. The parallelpiped algorithm constructs a class volume in data space to further constrain the identification of data points as a given class. Maximum likelihood algorithms assume a Gaussian distribution of pixel values within each training class and tend to be somewhat more accurate in regions of high surficial variability. Image pixels that fall within some standard deviation of the training class mean are assigned to that class. This method has the added advantage of weighting such that image pixels are less likely to be classified as covers with low probability of occurrence in the scene. Maximum likelihood supervised classification is used for regions that have good ground truth data available, such as the Phoenix metro region. Verification of Classification Accuracy The accuracy of any classification must be assessed prior to use in scientific analysis. Accuracy assessment involves the collection of ground truth data for the classified scene. This is done by establishing a number of test pixels within the image for which the actual ground cover is determined by field inspection, use of aerial photographs, or use of some other dataset. An overall classification accuracy is then determined by dividing the number of test pixels correctly classified by the number of total test pixels. Assessment of accuracy for the CAP LTER study area is not straightforward as the major dataset available for comparison is the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) Land Use Map. Land use can be thought of as the purpose to which a particular area is devoted, such industrial or recreational use. Use of the MAG dataset for comparison with classified TM data requires interpretation of the land cover types in terms of possible land uses, which is complicated as several land covers may be associated with the same land use category. For example, the institutional MAG land use category corresponds to the asphalt+concrete+soil+/-metal roofs, asphalt+concrete+soil+/-metal roofs+/-grass, and concrete+grass+/-woody veg.+/-asphalt land cover classes. Land use is the primary data format used by the various LTER researchers, so a fairly simple categorization scheme was defined for use in LTER studies. Overall accuracy of the TM classification is 71%, a value which is typical for TM data.

This will provide multiyear increments for spatial change models and overlap with U.S. census information. Datasets for Land Cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) are produced on a regular schedule as appropriate remote sensing scenes become available. Land cover type, the primary product of remote-sensing classification, is a fundamental data set for nearly every aspect of the CAP LTER project. Already, it has been used to derive surface cover, aid in biological surveys, plan future science initiatives, and help define the patch typology of the system. The pilot project is currently using 1993 Landsat TM multispectral data to test and refine classification schemes for the urban, desert, and fringe regional of the CAP LTER. These classes, once accurately defined and field checked, will be form the basis of the LTER's patch typology and serve as a past baseline on the ground cover inventory of the Phoenix metropolitan area. To examine the temporal effects of urban growth and its impact on the desert ecology, it is critical to have data extending both into the past as well as the future. Past remote-sensing data is needed for patch and change modeling. It will take advantage of spatial patterns prior to large influxes of population and the subsequent change from agriculturally dominated to urban-dominated land cover. Data collected in the future will also provide a monitoring and projecting ability for the science team. More importantly, these data can be used to direct new and alter existing field projects within the CAP LTER. Because this data product will be constantly changing as urban growth continues, it is important to monitor and analyze these changes, as well as link them to land use and socioeconomic change. By expanding the remote-sensing analysis and data archive for the CAP LTER project we can extend the land cover classification to form a 60-year historic land cover inventory for Phoenix. This will provide the basis for multithematic, multitemporal, and multispatial scale research. Some research questions critical to the LTER science objectives which can be answered with the expansion of the data, both past and future, are: What is the distribution and variability of land cover classes in the Valley over time? How do these distributions change over time and by urban location? Are there single or multiple sequences? How do these changes relate to population expansion? What is the effect of this change on remote sensing, ecological, land use, and land value theoretical models? Can growth and economical change be monitored precisely with future data and how well can trends be identified based on projections of past data? Is growth happening in geologically metastable areas such as alluvial fans and potential floodplains? Research involves parcel and metropolitan level classification.

00013-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"With the exception of heteromyids, eg kangaroo rats and pocket mice, most small rodents in shortgrass steppe are omnivorous. Depending on season, arthropods (insects and arachnids) make up 40-85% of the diet of grasshopper mice and thirteen-lined ground squirrels, the most widespread rodents in northern shortgrass steppe. Small mammals are among the most important predators of ground-dwelling macroarthropods and herbivorous insects provide a direct resource link between weather and plant production. Understanding temporal variability in the abundance of arthropods is central to determining the mechanisms that drive small rodent populations. At present, there are no long-term studies of arthropods in shortgrass steppe, despite the important role that these taxa play in grassland food webs. Beginning in 1998, we implemented field protocols to track changes in relative abundance of terrestrial macroarthropods in grassland and shrub-dominated habitats of shortgrass steppe. Sampling was conducted on the six trapping webs (three upland prairie, three lowland saltbush) where we studied rodent populations, and was conducted approximately monthly from May-September (4-5 sessions/year). Ground-dwelling macroarthropods were sampled on each web using pitfall traps, set in one four-by-five grid, with 10 m between traps. Traps consisted of plastic cups (90-mm diameter, 120 mm deep), including a plastic funnel (90-mm diameter), buried flush with the ground surface. Traps were shaded with wooden covers held in place with nails; traps could be closed when not operational by nailing the cover flush to the ground. Traps were usually open for 4 consecutive days (ie 80 trap-days) during a trapping session. On the 4th day, captured arthropods were removed from the traps, identified and released. All arthropods were identified to the ordinal level; beetles (Coleoptera), crickets (Orthoptera), true bugs (Hemiptera) and spiders were identified to the familial level; and a few taxa, eg tenebrionid beetles, were identified to species. We also recorded any reptiles and amphibians captured. The number of individuals of each taxa captured per 100 trap-days was used as an index of relative abundance, with adjustments made for traps that were flooded or disturbed by cattle or for changes to the number of days that traps were open (range 4-7 days). We sampled grasshoppers by counting the numbers flushed from 0.78-m2 circular plots (hoops) placed on each web. Hoops were set out on the day that pitfall traps were opened and were surveyed on the day that traps were closed. A technician used a wooden lath to flush and count all grasshoppers from each hoop. Grasshoppers were not identified to species. Surveys were conducted in 1998, then were discontinued until 2002. In 1998 and from 2002-2005, nine hoops were sampled on each web. Beginning in 2006, we sampled a total of 20 hoops on each web."

00015-metadata.xml,Supplemental Information,/eml:eml/dataset/additionalInfo,"In the spring of 1982, as part of the establishment of the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in southern New Mexico, a 135 ha portion of a 1500 ha, internally drained, watershed was exclosed from grazing by domestic livestock. Prior to exclosure the watershed, as well as the rest of the Jornada basin, had been moderately to heavily grazed for the past 100 years. Concurrent with grazing, the vegetation had undergone a dramatic change from desert grassland, with an almost continuous cover of C4 perennial grasses, to isolated patches of the original grassland in a mosaic with desert shrub dominated plant communities (Buffington and Herbel, 1965). The exclosure lies along a northeast facing piedmont slope at the base of a steep isolated mountain peak, and covers a variety of component landforms from the foot of the mountain to the basin floor. The northeast side of the exclosure is immediately upslope of the College Playa located near the NMSU College Ranch. Three parallel transects (2.7 km in length) run from the middle of the College Playa up into the foot of Mt. Summerford. The Control transect is to the west, the Treatment transect on the east side of the Control transect, and the Alternate Control to the east of the Treatment transect. Each transect is 30 meters wide with a 45 meter buffer zone between each transect. The Treatment transect was treated annually until 1987 with NHNO3 in a concentration equal to 10g N/m2. The station markers at 30 meter intervals along each transect."

Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed. Data Acknowledgment Policy: Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use. Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned: Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project.

00015-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"*Roots were collected from areas on the watershed adjacent to the study transects. The roots were gently washed to remove adhering soil particles, then dried to a constant mass at 50 C. Roots were collected from species that comprise more than 10% of the vegetative cover. Between one and three root segments of the woody sub-shrub, Gutierrezia sarothrae, and the most common summer herbaceous annual, Baileya multiradiata, were tethered with fine wire attached to an aluminum tag labeled with the identity code and intial mass. Approximately 1 g of roots fo each species: black grama grass (Bouteloua eriopoda), fluff grass (Erioneuron pulchellum) and the grass from the dry lake basin (Panicum obtusum), were placed in each 12 cm X 12 cm fiberglass mesh bag (mesh size=1mm). We made 960 bundles of G. sarothrae roots and 960 bags of E. pulchellum roots. There were 160 bags or root bundles of the other species. Each bundle or bag was attached to a unique number tag connected to a 30 cm wire. Teh study was deisgned for the retrieval fo 8 units of each species from each watershed location and each transect on ten sample dates. Roots were buried in short trenches (3 m long) separated by approximately 3 m between trenches. Each bag or root bundle was separated from others in a trench by a minimum of 50 cm. The trenches were located at the appoximate mid-section of the fertilized transect of the basin slope and 80 bundles were buried in the mid-section of the un-fertilized transect of the basin slope. The roots of P. obtusum were placed in the dry lake basin, the roots of B. eriopoda were placed in the black grama grasss zone at teh top of the watershed, and the roots of B. multiradiata were placed in teh basin slope. Roots of G. sarothrae and E. pulchellum were placed in all vegetation zones because these species occur in all the zones on the watershed. The other species are restricted to one zone, and although B. multiradiata occurs in four zones, its highest abundance is in the basin slope zone. At all sites, roots and root bags were buried at 5-10 cm soil depth. Eight samples of each species were retrieved after 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months in the field. The sequence of removal was determined by drawing numbers from the remaining bags at random. Although this study was designed for 48 months duration, parts of teh study had to be terminated early. At 42 months the trenches were completely and carefully excavated and the remaining material recovered. We were unable to retrieve complete samples of roots except for G. sarothrae. The small number of root samples that were collected in month 42 were pooled by site and treatment in order to obtain sufficient material for the chemical analyses. After retrieval, roots were removed from the bags, gently washed in distilled water to remove adhering soil particles and dried to a constant mass at 50C. After the final dry mass measurement, the roots were ground in a laboratory mill equipped with a 1 mm screen. An exponential decay model was used to estimate the mass loss rate: X/Xo = ln -kt where X = mass remaining at time t (months), Xo = original weight, ln is the natural logarithm and k is the decomposition constant (Olson 1963). For the analysis of total nitrogen, sub-samples of ground roots were treated by Kjeldahl digestion in a block digestor. Ammonium nitrogen was analyzed by an automated salicylate procedure in a Scientific Instruments autoanalyzer (Fisher et al. 1987). Three organic matter fractions (water and non-polar solubles, acid solubles, and acid insolubles) were analyzed in the remaining root material. Non polar and water soluble substances were extracted using dichloromethane followed by hot (100 C) water (McGlaugherty et al. 1984). Acid soluble fiber, which was largely holocellulose, was separted from acid-soluble fiber (largely lignin and suberin) using a two-stage digestion in sulfuric acid (Effland 1977).

00016-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"By studying vegetation leafing phenology and its coupling with climate along the urban-rural gradient in Phoenix metropolitan region, USA, we elucidated the degree of urbanization-induced transformations of phenology and primary productivity. In this study we used time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spatially interpolated rainfall. Our analyses were stratified by major land covers and dominant soil texture. We also assessed time scales at which NDVI responds most strongly to climatic factors. No distinctive patterns in phenology were found along the urban-rural gradient; however some important generalities were confirmed. Agricultural and urban developments introduce growth multimodality, which is not attributable to desert but customarily found in riparian ecosystems of the area. Despite the existence of summer flush of growth in the desert its signal is not detected by de-noised satellite data. Urban and agricultural vegetation is characterized by fast growth and senescence rates. While agriculture has the shortest growth length, most urban vegetation stays photosynthetically active for longer periods. Growth in the desert is controlled by precipitation accumulated for 2-5 months. Spatial patterns of NDVI are predicted by precipitation grids. Positive relationship between these two variables changes seasonally reaching the maximum near the peak of annual growth. Spring and summer NDVI grids are in better agreement with longer term accumulated precipitation, but the early autumn growth is correlated more with immediate rainfall. Spatial and temporal correlations of desert NDVI with temperature are negative confirming the role of temperature in stimulating water loss from the soil. Our results supported the hypothesis that coarse-textured soils limit evaporative losses of soil water and promote growth. Riparian NDVI are moderately positively correlated with temperature but only weakly with precipitation. NDVI dynamics in urban and agricultural land covers are completely unsynchronized with natural vegetation communities and decoupled with precipitation. They exhibit positive, yet low, correlation with temperature. Overall, urbanization adds a greater diversity of phenological patterns that are not determined by climatic variability. Instead, urban and agricultural vegetation dynamics is expected to be explained largely by socio-economic variables."

NDVI is computed from reflectance data corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption and aerosols, and adjusted to nadir and Sun angles with the use of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BDRF) models (Huete et al. 1999, van Leeuwen et al. 1999). The index is based on the property of green vegetation to strongly absorb red and reflect near-infrared wavelengths, and is calculated as (Tucker 1979, Huete et al. 1999): NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED) where NIR is MODIS band 2 (841-846 nm) and RED is MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm). Final 16-day maximum composites are produced by combining multiple days and filtering out clouds and data with bad integrity. We obtained 250-m NDVI images (MOD13Q1 product) for 2000-2005 and examined data using quality flags from companion Quality Assurance (QA) images.

TIMESAT implements three processing methods based on least-squares fits to the upper envelope of NDVI time-series, accounting for negatively biased noise (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Data fitting with local polynomial functions classified as adaptive Savitsky-Golay filtering was preferred in our study. It most closely corresponded to raw NDVI data during calibration and method testing. Three adaptation runs were executed with search window set to 2, 3, and 4 consecutive NDVI values. Start and end of growth periods were defined as a 20% increase or decrease in NDVI values.

The purpose of this data is to provide ground-truth data for comparison with low-level aerial photographs of each study plot. Three, 29 meter lines were measured along three of six rows of the permanent vegetation measurement quadrats. Each line was measured at 10cm resolution for intercepts of perennial plant live canopy cover, and for bare ground. 10cm resolution is comparable to the resolution of the aerial photos. All plants were identified to the species level. These line-intercept measurements are taken once every ten years, at the same time that low-level aerial photographs are taken. These data will be compared to both decadal air photos, and annual measures of vegetation from one-meter2 quadrats on each plot to provide information on vegetation change over time relative to the various animal exclosure treatments."

00018-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data Policies Objectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed. Data Acknowledgment Policy: Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use. Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned: Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project. Funding for these data was provided by the U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210). Please send 1 copy of any publication that cites Jornada Basin LTER data to: John P.

00018-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data Policies Objectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System.

Measurements of perpendicular distance of each rabbit from the center of the road were used to estimate densities (number of rabbits per square kilometer) via Program DISTANCE.  Results from 1992 to 2002 indicated that spring was the peak density period of the year, with generally steady declines through the year until the following spring. Evidence of a long-term 'cycle' (e.g., the 11 year cycle reported for rabbits in the Great Basin Desert) did not appear in the Sevilleta rabbit populations."

00019-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"When the samples were collected: The samples were collected in winter, spring, summer, and fall, of each year.  Rabbit populations were sampled during a single night during each of these four seasons per year.  Dates of collection varied in some years, but generally the sampling was conducted in January, April, July, and October.Sampling Design: The rabbits were sampled along 21.5 miles of roadway that was broken up into four 'legs' of varying lengths.Leg A:  Black Butte southward to Five Points (5.7 miles).Leg B:  Five Points eastward to the turnoff before Palo Duro Canyon (4.1 miles).Leg C:  Palo Duro turnoff northward to the old McKenzie Headquarters site (6.1 miles).Leg D:  McKenzie Headquarters site northwestward to Black Butte (5.6 miles).Measurement Techniques: The rabbit surveys were conducted at night using spotlights. Surveys began one hour after sunset, when no trace of sunlight or dusk remained.  Beginning in 1998, samples were taken only during full-moon periods. A pickup truck was driven slowly (8-10 miles per hour) along the road of the 21.5 mile circuit.  Two (or more) observers stood in the bed of the pickup truck, and scanned the left and right sides (respectively) of the road with spotlights, while the driver kept watch for rabbits directly in front in the road.  During 1992, the spotlights were Q-Beam 500,000 candlepower spotting lights, with both flood and spot settings (spot settings were used during the rabbit sampling).  From 1993 through 1996, Q-Beam spotlights with 1,000,000 candlepower were used.  In 1997, new spotlights with 3,000,000 candlepower were used; these lights were set permanently on 'flood', but illuminated well at distances previously reached by the spot settings of the less-powerful spotlights.  In addition to the spotlights used by the standing observers in the bed of the pickup truck, two spotlights mounted on the pillar posts of the truck's cab were turned on and set for the roadsides ahead of the truck; these lights, coupled with the high-beam setting of the truck's headlights, illuminated the road in front of the truck for approximately 100 meters. When a rabbit was observed, one person's spotlight illuminated the spot at which the rabbit was first seen.  The second person's spotlight would track the rabbit, so that it was not counted twice.  A meter tape was walked out from the center of the truck bed (which equalled the center of the road) in a perpendicular direction from the road to the location at which the rabbit was first observed.  That distance was measured and recorded to the nearest meter.If a rabbit was observed in the middle of the road, the distance was recorded as zero.  Beginning in January, 2000, perpendicular distances to the rabbits were taken with a laser range finder, with accuracies of less than 1 meter (accuracies were tested before field use and confirmed to be 10 per leg), the difference legs were analyzed separately, and the resulting mean densities were estimated by averaging the four leg estimates.  In the results tables below, these instances are indicated by the category, 'MEAN'.  If sample sizes were too small to estimate the four legs separately, then all the rabbit observations were pooled together, and a density estimate for the entire 21.5 mile survey was calculated. These results are indicated by the category, 'ALL'.

Berino Series: fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Haplargids., Hydrology: Surface water only during rain events, no arroyos. Run-on plain for Los Pinos Mountains., Vegetation: The terrain is generally a mixed-species desert grassland, dominated by black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), blue grama (B. gracilis), sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola), various drop seeds and sacatons (Sporobolus spp.), purple three-awn (Aristida purpurea), and burrow grass (Scleropogon brevifolia). Shrubs are common in the area around Five Points, including creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) and snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae)., Climate: Long-term mean annual precipitation is 243 mm, about 60% of which occurs during the summer. Long-term mean monthly temperatures for January and July are 1.5 degrees C and 25.1 degrees C, respectively., History: McKenzie Flats encompasses an area of approximately 50 square miles and was one of the primary livestock grazing areas within what is now the Sevilleta NWR. Cattle have been excluded from the site since 1974-76. The ranch headquarters buildings and corrals were located at the junction of Legs C and D of the coyote survey. , siteid: 25 106.691 106.691 34.3592 34.3592 1615 1615 meter"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park. There are a total of 21 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle.-81.07794623-80.4897820725.7614517124.912934922000-05-012006-04-30FCE LTER II: Coastal Oligotrophic Ecosystems ResearchEvelynGaiserFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkOE 148MiamiFL33199USA305-348-6145305-348-4096gaisere@fiu.eduLead Principal InvestigatorMikeHeithausFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of Biological SciencesMarine Biology ProgramFlorida International UniversityBiscayne Bay CampusMiamiFL33181USA(305) 919-5234(305) 919-4030heithaus@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorRudolfJaffeFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of ChemistryFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkCP 304MiamiFL33199USA305-348-2456305-348-4096jaffer@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorRenePriceFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of Earth SciencesFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkPC 34411200 SW 8th StreetMiamiFL33199USA305-348-3119305-348-3877pricer@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorOur FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00022-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The overall goal of the rainfall manipulation project is to understand the coupled ecological and hydrological responses of a grassland, shrubland and a mixed grass-shrub vegetation community to extended periods of increased or decreased rainfall. Rainfall manipulation plots have been established in each of these three vegetation communities in the Five Points area of Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge. In each vegetation community, three control plots, three drought treatment plots, and three water addition plots have been installed, each approximately 10 x 15 m in size. In each plot, vertical profiles of soil moisture probes have been installed under each cover type (canopy and interspace in grassland and shrubland; grass canopy, shrub canopy and interspace at the ecotone (mixed grass-shrub) site). The probes measure differences in infiltration and soil water content and potential associations with these different cover types. In addition, TDR probes have been installed diagonally in each cover type to integrate the water content of the top 15 cm of soil. Each plot contains 18, 1m2 quads made up of 6, 1m2 quads along each of the 3 transects located across each plot. Each spring and fall, the following parameters are measured in every quad: live plant cover, height, and abundance by species; dead plant cover; soil cover; litter cover; and rock cover. Data collection began in the drought and control plots in the spring of 2002. Data collection began in the water addition plots in the spring of 2004.In the grassland and shrubland communities, all nine currently established plots are located together. The three drought plots were located under a single large roof with a 0.5 m path separating each plot (drought treatments ended in 2006). The control plots and water addition plots are similarly grouped, but without the shelter structure. In the ecotone community, the plots are in three groups; each group is comprised of one drought plot, one water addition plot, and one control plot. Control plots received no experimental treatment, while the sliding roofs over the drought plots were used to divert precipitation, producing a long-term drought. The roofs covering the drought plots were lowered when there was no precipitation so that the amount of sunlight received by the drought plots was minimally affected. Water addition was intended to impose a complementary increase in water supply on the water addition plots. "

00022-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Quadrat measurements One meter2 vegetation quadrats are used to measure the cover and abundance of all plants present along each of the three transects across each plot.  These quadrats are also used to measure dead plant foliage, leaf litter, bare soil, and rock covers. One person works on each quad, recording the data into a palm top computer.  Two technicians may work independently along the same transect and alternate quadrats.    To begin quadrat measurements, first locate the three pairs of rebar along the length (across the slope, perpendicular to the gutter edge) of each plot, which mark the endpoints of each transect. Once the transect has been located, run a string across the plot attaching it to the two transect endpoint rebar stakes to act as a guideline for measurements.  Each transect is measured from the left to the right side of the plot (where left and right are from the perspective of a person standing at the bottom edge of the plot where the gutters are located).  Beginning at the left side of the transect, place the bottom edge of the quadrat along the guidline of the string with the quad pointing away from the gutter edge. After measuring the quadrat, advance the quadrat along the transect by moving the quadrat to the right so that the bottom left corner is moved to the position formerly occupied by the bottom right corner.  Repeat this process until the entire width of the transect has been measured.  *Note: Beginning in the spring of 2010 only quadrats 2-7 (or meters 2-7) were measured. Before the spring of 2010 there were a variable number of quadrats measured per transect.  If the last quadrat did not lie completely within the boundaries of the plot (within the metal edging), the percentage of the plot that lied within the plot boundary was recorded in the comments column of the data sheet and the vegetation data was recorded in the same manner as for the other quadrats.  If the last quadrat lied completely within the boundaries of the plot, 100%  was recorded in the comments section of the data sheet.  This was to ensure that the entire transect had been measured. General vegetation measurementsThe cover, height, and abundance (standing biomass) are recorded for each species of plant inside the quadrat.  Vegetation measurements are taken in two layers: a ground level layer that includes all grasses, forbs, sub-shrubs, the bases of Larrea tridentata and bare soil and a “shrub” layer that includes the canopy of Larrea tridentata.  The purpose of this approach is to include Larrea canopies, while allowing the cover values of the ground level layer to sum to approximately 100%.    The quadrat boundaries are delineated by the 1 m2 PVC-frame placed above the quadrat.   Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string.  The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 % of the total quadrat area or cover.  The cover and height of all individual plants of a species that fall within the 1m2 quadrat are measured.  Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by all individual plants of a particular species, and/or partial cover for individual plants less than 1%. When reading plant cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat.  If you are not directly centered over the vegetation, cover measurements can be over or underestimated by your angle of view (parallax).  If the surrounding plants prohibit you from leaning directly over the plants, use a tape measure to delineate a vertical column of intercept.  To do this, simply extend the tape measure vertically from the base of the plant up to the frame grid.  Vegetation cover measurementsCover measurements are made by summing the cover values for all individual plants of a given species that fall within an infinite vertical column that is defined by the inside edge of the PVC-frame. This includes vegetation that is rooted outside of the frame but has foliage that extends into the vertical column defined by the PVC-frame.  Again, cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by each species.  Do not duplicate overlapping canopies, just record the total canopy cover on a horizontal plane when looking down on the quadrat through the grid.Larger cover values will vary but the smallest cover value recorded should never be below 0.1%.  When dealing with individual plants that are less than 1.00%, round the measurements to an increment of 0.1.  Cover values between 1.00 - 5.00% should be rounded to an increment of 0.5 and values more than 5.00% are rounded to an increment of 5. Cover measurements should be calculated separately for living and dead individuals of each species.  However, because these measurements are made infrequently, vegetation should be considered live if it represents the current year’s growth (green and yellow).  This is particularly important for grasses that may have become senescent during the fall sampling of each year.Creosote:Two Larrea tridentata coverage measurements are taken (LATR2 for canopy and LATR2B for the basal cover).  The canopy level layer is estimated using the portion of the canopy that falls within the quadrat.  The canopy edge is defined by a straight gravity line from the canopy to the ground (i.e. imagine a piece of string with a weight on the end being moved around the canopy edge).  A basal cover is taken at the base of the shrub and includes all woody vegetation that stems from the ground.  The purpose of taking two measurements for Larrea is to assess changes in shrub canopy cover without confounding the percent cover estimates of other species obtained using the basal layer. For Larrea seedlings the code LSEED is used and is a separate measurement from the Larrea canopy and basal measurements.Grasses:To determine the cover of a grass clump, envision a perimeter around the central mass or densest portion of the plant excluding individual long leaves, wispy ends or more open upper regions of the plant.  Live tissue is frequently mixed with dead tissue in grass clumps.  Provide two sets of measurements for the dead and live foliage, if possible, especially for perennial grass species.  In the case that both live and dead are difficult to separate, measure all of the foliage as live.  Remember that vegetation should be considered live if it represents the current year’s growth.  In general, recently dead foliage is yellow and long-dead foliage is gray.  Forbs:The cover of forbs is the perimeter around the densest portion of the plant. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage.Cacti and Yucca:The cover of cacti and yucca is made by estimating a perimeter around the densest portion of the plant and recorded as a single cover.  For cacti that consist of a cluster of pads or jointed stems (i.e., Opuntia phaecantha, Opuntia imbricata), estimate an average perimeter around the series of plant parts and record a single coverage measurement.Vines:Vine cover (and some forbs) is often convoluted.  Rather than attempt to estimate cover directly, take a frequency count of 10X10X10cm cubes that the vine is present in.Seedlings:As with other vegetation measurements, the smallest cover value for seedlings should never be 5.00% are rounded to an increment of 5.Remember, if some of the individuals of a plant species, or if portions of the foliage of an individual plant on the quadrat are dead and some alive, provide two sets of measurements for the dead and living foliage. In the case that both live and dead foliage are intermixed and difficult to separate, as in some bunch grasses and shrubs, just record the foliage as live. Any dead plant foliage that is not still attached to the roots and standing is considered leaf litter.Non-Vegetation MeasurementsMaterials other than vegetation that are measured in the drought plots include leaf litter, soil, rocks, and buckets (see below). Other than buckets, which occur in very few plots, values should always be recorded for these materials.  If they are not present in a given quad, put ”-888” for their cover values so that it is clear that these categories were not simply overlooked during data collection.  Heights and abundances are not recorded for any of these materials. Instead, record “-888” for height and abundance and a numerical value for cover, where applicable (see below). If not recorded in the field, the data manager will do so during the QA/QC process.    Leaf litter:Leaf litter includes all detached dead plant material on the soil surface, including woody branches.  Cover is quantified by summing the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by patches of leaf litter.  Cover values less than 5.00% should be rounded to increments of 1 and cover values more than 5.00% should be recorded in increments of 5.  If there is no leaf litter in the quadrat, record “LITT” in the “species “ column and record “-888” in the cover, height, and abundance columns.    Some leaf litter cover has distinctive margins and is easy to define and measure. However, leaf litter may occur in diffuse small patches that are separated by bare soil, and distributed throughout the quadrat. For such diffuse cover, determine the actual cover in one typical 10 by 10 cm square (e.g., 0.3), then count the number of squares with diffuse cover (e.g., 5), and multiply the number of squares by the actual cover for a typical square (e.g., 0.3 X 5 = 1.5, then round to 1.0 or 2.0, or if the value had been greater than 5, round to the nearest increment of 5.0) for the total leaf litter cover. All leaf litter measurements are pooled into one observation, and no height or abundance is measured.  Only measure leaf litter that is in the open, do not attempt to measure within clumps of grass, etc.     Soil:Measure the cover of the area occupied by abiotic substrates.  Cover is quantified by summing the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by abiotic substrates.  As with leaf litter, cover values less than 5.00% should be rounded to increments of 1 and cover values more than 5.00% should be recorded in increments of 5.  If there is no soil in the quadrat, record “SOIL” in the species column for that quadrat and record a “-888” for the height, cover, and abundance. Again, when soil is present, only the cover is recorded and “-888” should be entered for height and count.  Rock:   As a separate entry, estimate the cover of rock (particles more than1 cm) occurring within the bare ground.  The rock cover estimate can be viewed as an index of how much of the soil surface is rocky or as a subset of the soil cover measurement.  The rock cover should still be measured as a sum of the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by rock.  Cover values  less than 5.00% should be rounded to increments of 1 and cover values more than 5.00% should be recorded in increments of 5.  Enter “-888” for the height and count.  If there is no rock cover in the quadrat, record “ROCK” in the species column and enter “-888” for the height, count, and cover.

00022-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Quadrat measurements One meter2 vegetation quadrats are used to measure the cover and abundance of all plants present along each of the three transects across each plot.  These quadrats are also used to measure dead plant foliage, leaf litter, bare soil, and rock covers. One person works on each quad, recording the data into a palm top computer.  Two technicians may work independently along the same transect and alternate quadrats.    To begin quadrat measurements, first locate the three pairs of rebar along the length (across the slope, perpendicular to the gutter edge) of each plot, which mark the endpoints of each transect. Once the transect has been located, run a string across the plot attaching it to the two transect endpoint rebar stakes to act as a guideline for measurements.  Each transect is measured from the left to the right side of the plot (where left and right are from the perspective of a person standing at the bottom edge of the plot where the gutters are located).  Beginning at the left side of the transect, place the bottom edge of the quadrat along the guidline of the string with the quad pointing away from the gutter edge. After measuring the quadrat, advance the quadrat along the transect by moving the quadrat to the right so that the bottom left corner is moved to the position formerly occupied by the bottom right corner.  Repeat this process until the entire width of the transect has been measured.  *Note: Beginning in the spring of 2010 only quadrats 2-7 (or meters 2-7) were measured. Before the spring of 2010 there were a variable number of quadrats measured per transect.  If the last quadrat did not lie completely within the boundaries of the plot (within the metal edging), the percentage of the plot that lied within the plot boundary was recorded in the comments column of the data sheet and the vegetation data was recorded in the same manner as for the other quadrats.  If the last quadrat lied completely within the boundaries of the plot, 100%  was recorded in the comments section of the data sheet.  This was to ensure that the entire transect had been measured. General vegetation measurementsThe cover, height, and abundance (standing biomass) are recorded for each species of plant inside the quadrat.  Vegetation measurements are taken in two layers: a ground level layer that includes all grasses, forbs, sub-shrubs, the bases of Larrea tridentata and bare soil and a “shrub” layer that includes the canopy of Larrea tridentata.  The purpose of this approach is to include Larrea canopies, while allowing the cover values of the ground level layer to sum to approximately 100%.    The quadrat boundaries are delineated by the 1 m2 PVC-frame placed above the quadrat.   Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string.  The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 % of the total quadrat area or cover.  The cover and height of all individual plants of a species that fall within the 1m2 quadrat are measured.  Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by all individual plants of a particular species, and/or partial cover for individual plants less than 1%. When reading plant cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat.  If you are not directly centered over the vegetation, cover measurements can be over or underestimated by your angle of view (parallax).  If the surrounding plants prohibit you from leaning directly over the plants, use a tape measure to delineate a vertical column of intercept.  To do this, simply extend the tape measure vertically from the base of the plant up to the frame grid.  Vegetation cover measurementsCover measurements are made by summing the cover values for all individual plants of a given species that fall within an infinite vertical column that is defined by the inside edge of the PVC-frame. This includes vegetation that is rooted outside of the frame but has foliage that extends into the vertical column defined by the PVC-frame.  Again, cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by each species.  Do not duplicate overlapping canopies, just record the total canopy cover on a horizontal plane when looking down on the quadrat through the grid.Larger cover values will vary but the smallest cover value recorded should never be below 0.1%.  When dealing with individual plants that are less than 1.00%, round the measurements to an increment of 0.1.  Cover values between 1.00 - 5.00% should be rounded to an increment of 0.5 and values more than 5.00% are rounded to an increment of 5. Cover measurements should be calculated separately for living and dead individuals of each species.  However, because these measurements are made infrequently, vegetation should be considered live if it represents the current year’s growth (green and yellow).  This is particularly important for grasses that may have become senescent during the fall sampling of each year.Creosote:Two Larrea tridentata coverage measurements are taken (LATR2 for canopy and LATR2B for the basal cover).  The canopy level layer is estimated using the portion of the canopy that falls within the quadrat.  The canopy edge is defined by a straight gravity line from the canopy to the ground (i.e. imagine a piece of string with a weight on the end being moved around the canopy edge).  A basal cover is taken at the base of the shrub and includes all woody vegetation that stems from the ground.  The purpose of taking two measurements for Larrea is to assess changes in shrub canopy cover without confounding the percent cover estimates of other species obtained using the basal layer. For Larrea seedlings the code LSEED is used and is a separate measurement from the Larrea canopy and basal measurements.Grasses:To determine the cover of a grass clump, envision a perimeter around the central mass or densest portion of the plant excluding individual long leaves, wispy ends or more open upper regions of the plant.  Live tissue is frequently mixed with dead tissue in grass clumps.  Provide two sets of measurements for the dead and live foliage, if possible, especially for perennial grass species.  In the case that both live and dead are difficult to separate, measure all of the foliage as live.  Remember that vegetation should be considered live if it represents the current year’s growth.  In general, recently dead foliage is yellow and long-dead foliage is gray.  Forbs:The cover of forbs is the perimeter around the densest portion of the plant. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage.Cacti and Yucca:The cover of cacti and yucca is made by estimating a perimeter around the densest portion of the plant and recorded as a single cover.  For cacti that consist of a cluster of pads or jointed stems (i.e., Opuntia phaecantha, Opuntia imbricata), estimate an average perimeter around the series of plant parts and record a single coverage measurement.Vines:Vine cover (and some forbs) is often convoluted.  Rather than attempt to estimate cover directly, take a frequency count of 10X10X10cm cubes that the vine is present in.Seedlings:As with other vegetation measurements, the smallest cover value for seedlings should never be 5.00% are rounded to an increment of 5.Remember, if some of the individuals of a plant species, or if portions of the foliage of an individual plant on the quadrat are dead and some alive, provide two sets of measurements for the dead and living foliage. In the case that both live and dead foliage are intermixed and difficult to separate, as in some bunch grasses and shrubs, just record the foliage as live. Any dead plant foliage that is not still attached to the roots and standing is considered leaf litter.Non-Vegetation MeasurementsMaterials other than vegetation that are measured in the drought plots include leaf litter, soil, rocks, and buckets (see below). Other than buckets, which occur in very few plots, values should always be recorded for these materials.  If they are not present in a given quad, put ”-888” for their cover values so that it is clear that these categories were not simply overlooked during data collection.  Heights and abundances are not recorded for any of these materials. Instead, record “-888” for height and abundance and a numerical value for cover, where applicable (see below). If not recorded in the field, the data manager will do so during the QA/QC process.    Leaf litter:Leaf litter includes all detached dead plant material on the soil surface, including woody branches.  Cover is quantified by summing the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by patches of leaf litter.  Cover values less than 5.00% should be rounded to increments of 1 and cover values more than 5.00% should be recorded in increments of 5.  If there is no leaf litter in the quadrat, record “LITT” in the “species “ column and record “-888” in the cover, height, and abundance columns.    Some leaf litter cover has distinctive margins and is easy to define and measure. However, leaf litter may occur in diffuse small patches that are separated by bare soil, and distributed throughout the quadrat. For such diffuse cover, determine the actual cover in one typical 10 by 10 cm square (e.g., 0.3), then count the number of squares with diffuse cover (e.g., 5), and multiply the number of squares by the actual cover for a typical square (e.g., 0.3 X 5 = 1.5, then round to 1.0 or 2.0, or if the value had been greater than 5, round to the nearest increment of 5.0) for the total leaf litter cover. All leaf litter measurements are pooled into one observation, and no height or abundance is measured.  Only measure leaf litter that is in the open, do not attempt to measure within clumps of grass, etc.     Soil:Measure the cover of the area occupied by abiotic substrates.  Cover is quantified by summing the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by abiotic substrates.  As with leaf litter, cover values less than 5.00% should be rounded to increments of 1 and cover values more than 5.00% should be recorded in increments of 5.  If there is no soil in the quadrat, record “SOIL” in the species column for that quadrat and record a “-888” for the height, cover, and abundance. Again, when soil is present, only the cover is recorded and “-888” should be entered for height and count.  Rock:   As a separate entry, estimate the cover of rock (particles more than1 cm) occurring within the bare ground.  The rock cover estimate can be viewed as an index of how much of the soil surface is rocky or as a subset of the soil cover measurement.  The rock cover should still be measured as a sum of the number of 10cm x 10cm squares intercepted by rock.  Cover values  less than 5.00% should be rounded to increments of 1 and cover values more than 5.00% should be recorded in increments of 5.  Enter “-888” for the height and count.  If there is no rock cover in the quadrat, record “ROCK” in the species column and enter “-888” for the height, count, and cover.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00025-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Our main objective in the Phoenix Area Social Study (PASS) is to examine the reciprocal relationships, or the interplay, between the social and natural environments in an urban ecosystem. In order to understand this complex process, social scientists affiliated with the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project propose to conduct a longitudinal social survey of residents in the Phoenix-Mesa Area MSA. The survey will measure the social ties of individuals to their communities, values and sentiments regarding communities, behaviors that affect the natural environment, and satisfaction with the quality of life in the area. The community that people experience most intimately is the neighborhood. Our central research questions ask how neighborhood social ties, values, and behaviors are connected with one another in ways that reflect willingness to act socially and politically with respect to the environment, and how changing environmental conditions, in turn, affect the quality of human life."

00025-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"40 The PASS pilot study was based on an area probability sample of housing units within selected census block groups in the city of Phoenix. Block groups (which generally consist of between one-eighth and one-half of a square mile) were used to define the boundaries of neighborhoods because their residents are relatively homogenous in demographic and social characteristics and because block groups can be linked readily to decennial census and other sources of spatially referenced data. To coordinate PASS data with ecological measures gathered by the CAP LTER, the sampling frame for block groups was Survey 200, randomly selected plots in Maricopa County that are long-term monitoring sites of the CAP LTER. By choosing Survey 200 sites, data on human behavior can be coordinated with an array of biotic and abiotic data collected by CAP LTER scientists. Of those census block groups that overlay the Survey 200 plots, 117 are located in residential areas and 45 sites are within residential areas in the city of Phoenix. Selecting only block groups within the city of Phoenix allowed for a constant level of municipal services and a uniform government structure among neighborhoods. Decennial census data from 1990 and 2000 were collected for the 45 block groups within the city of Phoenix. After visiting a variety of possible survey sites, a purposive sample of six block groups was chosen in order to maximize differences between location (fringe, suburban, and core) and family income (higher, middle, and lower) of the neighborhoods. The term 'neighborhoods' in this study generally corresponds to the boundaries of the census block group. However, the two fringe block groups are geographically large due to low population density, so these neighborhoods consist of only a portion of the block group. PASS was administered by the ASU Survey Research Laboratory. Using Maricopa County Assessor maps of the targeted block groups, the dwelling units were enumerated by neighborhood and an area probability sample was drawn. Interviewers visited the households and recruited participants for the survey. An incentive (pair of movie tickets) was offered to those who would complete the interview. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish either at the house or by telephone using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system. The survey consisted of more than 370 items. A total of 217 interviews were completed with approximately equal numbers per neighborhood: HF1 is 32, HF2 is 38, MS1 is 32, MS2 is 37, LC1 is 39, LC2 is 39. The response rate was 43 percent overall, calculated as the number of completed surveys divided by the sum of completions and refusals (at the door and on the phone). By neighborhood, response rates ranged from 35 percent to 57 percent, with the highest rate in the poorest neighborhood, LC1. Interviews were conducted from October 9, 2001 through April 20, 2002."

00025-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"40 The PASS pilot study was based on an area probability sample of housing units within selected census block groups in the city of Phoenix. Block groups (which generally consist of between one-eighth and one-half of a square mile) were used to define the boundaries of neighborhoods because their residents are relatively homogenous in demographic and social characteristics and because block groups can be linked readily to decennial census and other sources of spatially referenced data. To coordinate PASS data with ecological measures gathered by the CAP LTER, the sampling frame for block groups was Survey 200, randomly selected plots in Maricopa County that are long-term monitoring sites of the CAP LTER. By choosing Survey 200 sites, data on human behavior can be coordinated with an array of biotic and abiotic data collected by CAP LTER scientists. Of those census block groups that overlay the Survey 200 plots, 117 are located in residential areas and 45 sites are within residential areas in the city of Phoenix. Selecting only block groups within the city of Phoenix allowed for a constant level of municipal services and a uniform government structure among neighborhoods. Decennial census data from 1990 and 2000 were collected for the 45 block groups within the city of Phoenix. After visiting a variety of possible survey sites, a purposive sample of six block groups was chosen in order to maximize differences between location (fringe, suburban, and core) and family income (higher, middle, and lower) of the neighborhoods. The term 'neighborhoods' in this study generally corresponds to the boundaries of the census block group. However, the two fringe block groups are geographically large due to low population density, so these neighborhoods consist of only a portion of the block group. PASS was administered by the ASU Survey Research Laboratory. Using Maricopa County Assessor maps of the targeted block groups, the dwelling units were enumerated by neighborhood and an area probability sample was drawn. Interviewers visited the households and recruited participants for the survey. An incentive (pair of movie tickets) was offered to those who would complete the interview. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish either at the house or by telephone using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) system. The survey consisted of more than 370 items. A total of 217 interviews were completed with approximately equal numbers per neighborhood: HF1 is 32, HF2 is 38, MS1 is 32, MS2 is 37, LC1 is 39, LC2 is 39. The response rate was 43 percent overall, calculated as the number of completed surveys divided by the sum of completions and refusals (at the door and on the phone). By neighborhood, response rates ranged from 35 percent to 57 percent, with the highest rate in the poorest neighborhood, LC1. Interviews were conducted from October 9, 2001 through April 20, 2002."

00026-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"methods<em>Bacterial abundance</em> Water samples for all microbial analyses are harvested from the CTD-Rosette system. Bacterial abundance samples are analyzed within two hours by flow cytometry following the protocol of Gasol and del Giorgio (1997), with SYBR-Green staining on an Accuri C6 (Becton-Dickinson). Total bacteria concentrations were determined by adding 1 μm microspheres (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) and 5 μM final concentration of stain to 0.5 mL of sample. Samples were incubated in the dark for 30 minutes and analyzed for 2 minutes at a low flow rate. Numbers of total bacteria and beads were determined in cytograms of side scatter (SSC) versus green fluorescence (FL1). Calculation of the absolute concentration of stained particles was based on the total sample volume analyzed, as determined by the count of added microspheres. <em>Bacterial Production</em> Bacterial Production (BP) rates were derived from rates of 3H-leucine incorporation measured on samples extending over the upper 50-100 m. The leucine assays followed a procedure modified from the protocol originally proposed by Smith and Azam (1992). Briefly, triplicate 1.5 ml samples were incubated shortly after collection for ~3 h with 3H-leucine (MP Biomedical, Santa Ana, CA; >100 Ci/mmol, 20-25 nM final concentration) in 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tubes (Axygen SCT-200, Union City, CA). Incubations were maintained within 0.5°C of the in situ temperature in refrigerated circulator baths and terminated by the addition of 0.1 ml of 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). Samples were concentrated by centrifugation, rinsed with 5% TCA and 70% ethanol and air-dried overnight prior to radioassay by liquid scintillation counting in Ultima Gold cocktail (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, MA). Blank values of TCA-killed samples were subtracted from the average of the triplicates for each discrete depth sample. BP rates are derived by multiplying the leucine incorporation rate times 1500 gC mole-1 (Ducklow et al (2000).2003-01-062010-01-28Sampling takes place off the Western Antarctic Peninsula. There are two key sampling grids: an approximately 200km x 900km offshore grid and an inshore Palmer Basin grid within 2miles of Palmer Station on Anvers Island.-76.583028-59.885764-61.954356-68.967456-68.967456-59.885764-61.954356-59.885764-61.954356-76.583028-68.967456-76.583028Geographic Description"

A team of researchers seeks to understand the structure and function of the Western Antarctic Peninsula's marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the context of seasonal-to-interannual atmospheric and sea ice dynamics, as well as long-term climate change. The PAL measurement system (or grid) is designed to study marine and terrestrial food webs consisting principally of diatom primary producers, the dominant herbivore Antarctic krill, and the apex predator Adelie penguin. An attenuated microbial food web is also a focus. PAL studies these ecosystems annually over a regional scale grid of oceanographic stations and seasonally at Palmer Station. Palmer Station is located on Anvers Island west of the Antarctic Peninula. The peninsula runs perpendicular to a strong climatic gradient between the cold, dry continental regime to the south, characteristic of the Antarctic interior, and the warm, moist, maritime regime to the north. North-south shifts in the gradient give rise to large environmental variability to climate change. Sea ice extent and variability affects ecosystem changes at all trophic levels.

00028-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts. Some of these are: 1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising. Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today. This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning. It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm. CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past. While natural 'background' levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically. Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain. There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously. BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve."

00028-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"FACE TechnologyBioCON uses a unique Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) technology to elevate the atmospheric concentration of CO2 in the experimental plots. The FACE system used in the BioCON experiment was developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. It uses natural wind conditions to carry CO2 enriched air across the vegetation. Because the plants are outside in a more natural environment, the chamber effects normally created by enclosures such as greenhouses are reduced or eliminated.WeedingWeeds were placed in paper bags labeled with the plot number and date. Sometimes we sorted the weeds into categories; sixteen species weeds - weeds that were in the experiment but were not in the plot, and real weeds - weeds that were not in the experiment and found in the plot. All of the species that were not supposed to be in the plot were pulled. Weeding tools were used to try to get out all of the roots of each plant without damaging other plants surrounding it. The weeds were then put into one of the bags identified above and all of the bags were combined and placed into a main or 'big' bag. If soil was disturbed during the process of extracting plants, we made sure to smooth it out afterwards. All weeds were dried and weighed.BurningWe burned BioCON approximately every other spring. First we burned a ring from one side to another. Then we went through the ring and spot burned the areas that did not burn well during the first burn. We followed this procedure for each ring.FertilizerWe used 4 g NH4NO3/ M2/year and 0.474g 15NH415NO3 /plot/year. First, we filled a small tin full of soil (approximately 100g) and put it in a bucket. We did this 31 times for ring one. Each ring will have a varying number of tins full of soil based on the number of plots in that ring that are receiving the nitrogen application. We then added 3.28g 15NH415NO3 in the ring one bucket (each ring will have a different amount depending on the number of N addition plots in that ring). If the ring has 30 plots to receive the application 3.17g of 15NH415NO3 were added. If the ring has 32 plots to receive the application 3.39 g of 15 NH415NO3 were added. We mixed up the contents in the bucket and then placed a tin full of soil in each 2lb paper bag labeled with the plots for ring one. We then placed 15.69g of NH4NO3 in each paper bag and mixed the soil with the15N and the NH4NO3 as much as possible. We then repeated this with the appropriate number of tins of soil per bucket and appropriate amounts of 15N for each subsequent ring. When applying the fertilizer, we mentally created four equal squares in the plot and tried to place equal amounts of fertilizer in each of the four squares."

A new station (#48) was established during 1998 (on Oct 1 1998) at a site designated as Savana (initially called Blue Springs). Station 49 was installed in the Five Points area in 1999 and named Five Points. Another new station was established in 2001 at a new core study site designated as Blue Grama and given a station ID number of 50.

Rio Salado Grassland and Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites. Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site as the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location of Met Station 44. The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.  After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a 'T' in the road at the power lines.  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.   Vegetation: The Rio Salado Grassland site is Plains-Mesa Sand Scrub habitat characterized by stabilized deep-sand dominated by coppice dunes of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Co-dominant shrubs are sand sagebrush (Artemesia filifolia) and fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), with winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), broom indigobush (Psorothamnus scoparius), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) as other notable shrubs.

00029-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.). Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata). Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site. Notable forb species include trailing four o’clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2 106.717 106.717 34.3381 34.3381 1615 1615 meter"

Tables with aggregated temperature were then joined to the shapefile of meteorological stations. Spatial interpolation Temperature was gridded in two steps. First, I converted actual observations into hypothetical air temperature near land surface at 0 m above sea level (ASL) by applying a 6.5 K/km environmental lapse rate, which is the international standard set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Second, I used Geostatistical Analyst, the ArcGIS 9.1 extensio and performed ordinary kriging to produce a horizontal temperature distribution at 0 ASL. Standard Error maps were also produced along with temperature surfaces that were all rasterized to a 250 meter resolution grid. Final grids were created by using a digital elevation model (DEM) resampled to 250 meters and inverting the environmental lapse rate to the previously interpolated temperature surface.

This was done to adequately represent the rookery due to the extreme differences in elevation and exposure exhibited by individual colonies and the nest sites they contain. A different, random sample of nests is used each season. The procedure for determining chick weights at fledging was modified so that only chicks that had been previously flipper banded were included in the sample; this provides an additional, fine scale measure of fledging chronology. The procedure for determining the number of one and two chick broods is not one of the CEMP methods. These censuses begin the day after the first day that chicks show evidence of creching, which in the Palmer area typically brackets the 5-9 Jan period. In colonies where the number of active nests < 100, the entire colony is censused; where the number > 100, a 100 nest sample is used in a strip transect that is 5 nests wide and runs along the perimeter of the colony for a distance sufficient enough to obtain the sample.

00032-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"By studying vegetation leafing phenology and its coupling with climate along the urban-rural gradient in Phoenix metropolitan region, USA, we elucidated the degree of urbanization-induced transformations of phenology and primary productivity. In this study we used time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spatially interpolated rainfall. Our analyses were stratified by major land covers and dominant soil texture. We also assessed time scales at which NDVI responds most strongly to climatic factors. No distinctive patterns in phenology were found along the urban-rural gradient; however some important generalities were confirmed. Agricultural and urban developments introduce growth multimodality, which is not attributable to desert but customarily found in riparian ecosystems of the area. Despite the existence of summer flush of growth in the desert its signal is not detected by de-noised satellite data. Urban and agricultural vegetation is characterized by fast growth and senescence rates. While agriculture has the shortest growth length, most urban vegetation stays photosynthetically active for longer periods. Growth in the desert is controlled by precipitation accumulated for 2-5 months. Spatial patterns of NDVI are predicted by precipitation grids. Positive relationship between these two variables changes seasonally reaching the maximum near the peak of annual growth. Spring and summer NDVI grids are in better agreement with longer term accumulated precipitation, but the early autumn growth is correlated more with immediate rainfall. Spatial and temporal correlations of desert NDVI with temperature are negative confirming the role of temperature in stimulating water loss from the soil. Our results supported the hypothesis that coarse-textured soils limit evaporative losses of soil water and promote growth. Riparian NDVI are moderately positively correlated with temperature but only weakly with precipitation. NDVI dynamics in urban and agricultural land covers are completely unsynchronized with natural vegetation communities and decoupled with precipitation. They exhibit positive, yet low, correlation with temperature. Overall, urbanization adds a greater diversity of phenological patterns that are not determined by climatic variability. Instead, urban and agricultural vegetation dynamics is expected to be explained largely by socio-economic variables."

00032-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Meteorological data acquisition and preprocessing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard TERRA/AQUA satellites have a revisit period of 1-2 days and collect data in 36 spectral channels at three spatial resolutions (250 m, 500 m, and 1 km) with geolocation accuracy of approximately 50 m at nadir (Wolfe et al. 2002). NDVI is computed from reflectance data corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption and aerosols, and adjusted to nadir and Sun angles with the use of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BDRF) models (Huete et al. 1999, van Leeuwen et al. 1999). The index is based on the property of green vegetation to strongly absorb red and reflect near-infrared wavelengths, and is calculated as (Tucker 1979, Huete et al. 1999): NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED) where NIR is MODIS band 2 (841-846 nm) and RED is MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm).

TIMESAT implements three processing methods based on least-squares fits to the upper envelope of NDVI time-series, accounting for negatively biased noise (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Data fitting with local polynomial functions classified as adaptive Savitsky-Golay filtering was preferred in our study.

00032-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Meteorological data acquisition and preprocessing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments aboard TERRA/AQUA satellites have a revisit period of 1-2 days and collect data in 36 spectral channels at three spatial resolutions (250 m, 500 m, and 1 km) with geolocation accuracy of approximately 50 m at nadir (Wolfe et al. 2002). NDVI is computed from reflectance data corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption and aerosols, and adjusted to nadir and Sun angles with the use of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BDRF) models (Huete et al. 1999, van Leeuwen et al. 1999). The index is based on the property of green vegetation to strongly absorb red and reflect near-infrared wavelengths, and is calculated as (Tucker 1979, Huete et al. 1999): NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED) where NIR is MODIS band 2 (841-846 nm) and RED is MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm).

00034-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Introduction. Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986). Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson and Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown and Heske 1990, Brown and Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson and Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger and Brown 1981, Brown and Zeng 1989, Brown and Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown and Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer and Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers."

Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the access road to each site forming the X axis. The compass orientation at the Jornada grassland site is to the north, and Jornada creosotebush site is oriented to the south. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C; control), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R; rodent), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L; lagomorph), and one plot fenced with barbed wire to exclude cattle (Treatment B; bovine). Note that there are cattle exclosure plots only at the Jornada grassland site where cattle are present, for a total of 4 measurement plots at each of the grassland site blocks. There are only 3 measurement plots at each of the creosotebush site blocks. The treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters (see Figure 4). A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner of each plot, and running left to right, then down one row, and then right to left, and so on. A 2-foot rebar marks the lower right corner of each quadrat, and an aluminum tag on the rebar gives the quad number. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. Rodent trapping webs are being used to determine the composition of rodent species at each study site, and to estimate densities of each species over time. The use of webs and distance measures to estimate rodent densities is statistically more robust than grid plot sampling and mark-release indices. Each rodent trapping web consists of a series of 12 equally spaced lines radiating from a central point. Each line consists of 12 trap stations. The first trap station is located 5 meters from the center, the next three at 5 meter intervals, and the remaining 8 at ten meter intervals. Each trap line is 100 meters long, and each web is 200 meters in diameter."

00034-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field micro-cassette tape recorders Study Site and Experimental Design Description A creosotebush shrub study site and a black grama grassland study site have been established at each of the Sevilleta, Jornada and Mapimi research locations. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals (see Figures 1 and 2 for diagrams of the two Jornada sites). The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the access road to each site forming the X axis. The compass orientation at the Jornada grassland site is to the north, and Jornada creosotebush site is oriented to the south. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C; control), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R; rodent), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L; lagomorph), and one plot fenced with barbed wire to exclude cattle (Treatment B; bovine). Note that there are cattle exclosure plots only at the Jornada grassland site where cattle are present, for a total of 4 measurement plots at each of the grassland site blocks. There are only 3 measurement plots at each of the creosotebush site blocks. The treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters (see Figure 3). Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters (see Figure 4). A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner of each plot, and running left to right, then down one row, and then right to left, and so on (see Figure 4). A 2-foot rebar marks the lower right corner of each quadrat, and an aluminum tag on the rebar gives the quad number. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. Working on the Study Plots Always avoid walking on the quadrats, and do not walk across plots or anywhere within a block unless absolutely necessary. We are attempting to measure the effects of rodents and rabbits on plants and soils, not the effects of humans. When working on a plot, always walk on a line just below the rebar and quadrats, or on a line to the right of the rebar and quadrats (see dotted lines in Figure 4). Please try to walk gently and flat-footed on the study plots to minimize soil disturbance. When placing the vegetation measurement frame on a quadrat, be careful not to disturb the soil with the frame legs or your feet. When leaning over the measurement frame, be careful not to put your foot on the quadrat. We must measure all human caused disturbances to the soil surface of each quadrat. Vegetation Quadrat Measurements The foliage canopy area and maximum height of each plant species is measured from each quadrat. Several other variables are also measured from each quadrat, including soil surface disturbance, soil surface leaf litter cover, soil surface cryptogam crust cover, termite mud casing, and number of rabbit feces. All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame, which is 1 meter by 1 meter, and partitioned into a grid of 100, 10 cm by 10 cm squares. Cover is measured by counting the number of 10cm squares that are occupied by the foliage canopy of a particular plant species, or by the soil disturbance, leaf litter etc. Portions of the 10 cm squares are also measured, down to 0.1 of a square. Detailed descriptions of measurement techniques are given below for each of the different variables measured. Placement of the vegetation quadrat measurement frame Walk from quadrat to quadrat along the lines mentioned above and marked in Figure 4. When you reach a quadrat, place one leg of the frame immediately next to and touching the 2-foot rebar, over the quadrat. Place the leg for the opposite corner of the frame (from bottom to top of a diamond shape) just inside of the 3-inch nail located at a 315 degree angle from the rebar on the plot X/Y, and compass coordinate system. The frame should be positioned so that the sides are parallel to the sides of the plot and directly over the quadrat, and in line with the rows of rebar (see Figure 4). You may not be able to see the nail, if not, line the sides of the frame with the rows of rebar the best you can. Recording Data You will record the quadrat data into your tape recorder. Each time you start recording data from a new plot (even if you are just helping someone else finish a plot), always start your recording by stating: 'These are vegetation quadrat measurements for the Jornada small mammal exclosure study.' Then state the date (month, day, year), the site (G or C), the block (1,2, 3, or 4), the plot (1, 2, 3, or 4), and the treatment (C, R, or L). If you are helping someone else on a plot, state so, and record who the other person is. Go to the first quadrat you will be taking measurements from, and record the quadrat number (1-36) before you start recording data, by stating 'starting quadrat (n)'. Note that (n) means whatever the appropriate number or letter is. When you are finished recording data for that quadrat, state 'finished with quadrat (n).' Then go on to the next quadrat, and so on. When you have finished collecting data from the plot, state 'finished with quadrat measurements on plot (n), of block (n), at site (n), on (date).' Additional Observations, Corrections, and Comments If you have already recorded data for a variable, e.g., rabbit feces, but while looking over the quadrat later, see some more, you may either make a correction to the previously recorded values, or make another observation (e.g., 'correction, rabbit feces count (n)', or 'rabbit feces count (n).' At any time, if you realize that you recorded incorrect data, just state 'correction, .....' Always start corrections with the statement 'correction'. Do not try to run-back the tape and re-record over mistakes, just state 'correction', and mention the problem. For comments, state 'comment' and then record whatever you want to say about something. Comments are useful if you are uncertain about something, or see something unusual. Try to minimize use of comments though. Checking Your Tape Recordings Be sure to frequently play-back a small portion of your tape to verify that the tape recorder is working properly. Stop and play-back at least at the end of each line of 6 quadrats. Checking your tape after every other quadrat is even better. Labeling Your Tapes Be sure to label your tape, both on the cardboard case insert, and directly on the tape. Use the following format to label your tape: e.g., SMESVQF96-DL2 Where: SMES = small mammal exclosure study VQ = vegetation quadrat data F96 = fall 1996, or S96 for spring 1996 DL2 = initials for your name, in this case Dave Lightfoot, and the number of the ape, in this case, my second tape. Procedures for Vegetation Quadrat Measurements Below is a listing of procedures and values and ranges of values that you should record for each of the variables measured on the vegetation quadrats. IMPORTANT NOTE!!! Be sure to record an entry for all six of the following variables, even if the measurement or count is zero. So, for example, if there are no rabbit feces, record 'rabbit feces count zero' or if there is no termite casing, record 'termite casing zero' etc. Get into a routine of examining each quadrat for each of the 6 variables. For example, start with plant cover, starting with the dominant plant species, then look for leaf litter, then look for cryptogams, then look for soil disturbance, then look for rabbit feces, then look for termite casing. And be sure to record a value for each of the 6 variables for each quadrat. Soil Surface Disturbance from Animals Look for any soil surface disturbance caused by animals (including humans) and measure the cover in terms of 10 cm squares, in increments of no less than 0.1, and the vertical extent of the disturbance in centimeters. Vertical extent includes depth of holes, and height of mounds, often both involved with a particular disturbance. For holes and burrows, measure the depth only as far as you can see. Do not attempt to actually measure to the bottom of the burrow. If you can identify the type of animal that caused the disturbance, state the kind of animal. If you cannot determine what type of animal caused the disturbance, just state 'undetermined soil disturbance.' Record one observation for each type of disturbance on each quadrat. So, pool all cover values for each disturbance type, and record the maximum vertical extent over for all individual disturbances caused by that particular type of animal. Some examples include: ant mounds, rodent digs, rabbit digs, antelope tracks, rabbit tracks, coyote tracks, deer tracks, human footprints, and spider burrows. So, for example, for antelope tracks, state 'soil disturbance from antelope tracks, cover (n), height (n).'

00034-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field micro-cassette tape recorders Study Site and Experimental Design Description A creosotebush shrub study site and a black grama grassland study site have been established at each of the Sevilleta, Jornada and Mapimi research locations. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals (see Figures 1 and 2 for diagrams of the two Jornada sites). The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the access road to each site forming the X axis. The compass orientation at the Jornada grassland site is to the north, and Jornada creosotebush site is oriented to the south. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C; control), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R; rodent), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L; lagomorph), and one plot fenced with barbed wire to exclude cattle (Treatment B; bovine). Note that there are cattle exclosure plots only at the Jornada grassland site where cattle are present, for a total of 4 measurement plots at each of the grassland site blocks. There are only 3 measurement plots at each of the creosotebush site blocks. The treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters (see Figure 3). Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters (see Figure 4). A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner of each plot, and running left to right, then down one row, and then right to left, and so on (see Figure 4). A 2-foot rebar marks the lower right corner of each quadrat, and an aluminum tag on the rebar gives the quad number. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. Working on the Study Plots Always avoid walking on the quadrats, and do not walk across plots or anywhere within a block unless absolutely necessary. We are attempting to measure the effects of rodents and rabbits on plants and soils, not the effects of humans. When working on a plot, always walk on a line just below the rebar and quadrats, or on a line to the right of the rebar and quadrats (see dotted lines in Figure 4). Please try to walk gently and flat-footed on the study plots to minimize soil disturbance. When placing the vegetation measurement frame on a quadrat, be careful not to disturb the soil with the frame legs or your feet. When leaning over the measurement frame, be careful not to put your foot on the quadrat. We must measure all human caused disturbances to the soil surface of each quadrat. Vegetation Quadrat Measurements The foliage canopy area and maximum height of each plant species is measured from each quadrat. Several other variables are also measured from each quadrat, including soil surface disturbance, soil surface leaf litter cover, soil surface cryptogam crust cover, termite mud casing, and number of rabbit feces. All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame, which is 1 meter by 1 meter, and partitioned into a grid of 100, 10 cm by 10 cm squares. Cover is measured by counting the number of 10cm squares that are occupied by the foliage canopy of a particular plant species, or by the soil disturbance, leaf litter etc. Portions of the 10 cm squares are also measured, down to 0.1 of a square. Detailed descriptions of measurement techniques are given below for each of the different variables measured. Placement of the vegetation quadrat measurement frame Walk from quadrat to quadrat along the lines mentioned above and marked in Figure 4. When you reach a quadrat, place one leg of the frame immediately next to and touching the 2-foot rebar, over the quadrat. Place the leg for the opposite corner of the frame (from bottom to top of a diamond shape) just inside of the 3-inch nail located at a 315 degree angle from the rebar on the plot X/Y, and compass coordinate system. The frame should be positioned so that the sides are parallel to the sides of the plot and directly over the quadrat, and in line with the rows of rebar (see Figure 4). You may not be able to see the nail, if not, line the sides of the frame with the rows of rebar the best you can. Recording Data You will record the quadrat data into your tape recorder. Each time you start recording data from a new plot (even if you are just helping someone else finish a plot), always start your recording by stating: 'These are vegetation quadrat measurements for the Jornada small mammal exclosure study.' Then state the date (month, day, year), the site (G or C), the block (1,2, 3, or 4), the plot (1, 2, 3, or 4), and the treatment (C, R, or L). If you are helping someone else on a plot, state so, and record who the other person is. Go to the first quadrat you will be taking measurements from, and record the quadrat number (1-36) before you start recording data, by stating 'starting quadrat (n)'. Note that (n) means whatever the appropriate number or letter is. When you are finished recording data for that quadrat, state 'finished with quadrat (n).' Then go on to the next quadrat, and so on. When you have finished collecting data from the plot, state 'finished with quadrat measurements on plot (n), of block (n), at site (n), on (date).' Additional Observations, Corrections, and Comments If you have already recorded data for a variable, e.g., rabbit feces, but while looking over the quadrat later, see some more, you may either make a correction to the previously recorded values, or make another observation (e.g., 'correction, rabbit feces count (n)', or 'rabbit feces count (n).' At any time, if you realize that you recorded incorrect data, just state 'correction, .....' Always start corrections with the statement 'correction'. Do not try to run-back the tape and re-record over mistakes, just state 'correction', and mention the problem. For comments, state 'comment' and then record whatever you want to say about something. Comments are useful if you are uncertain about something, or see something unusual. Try to minimize use of comments though. Checking Your Tape Recordings Be sure to frequently play-back a small portion of your tape to verify that the tape recorder is working properly. Stop and play-back at least at the end of each line of 6 quadrats. Checking your tape after every other quadrat is even better. Labeling Your Tapes Be sure to label your tape, both on the cardboard case insert, and directly on the tape. Use the following format to label your tape: e.g., SMESVQF96-DL2 Where: SMES = small mammal exclosure study VQ = vegetation quadrat data F96 = fall 1996, or S96 for spring 1996 DL2 = initials for your name, in this case Dave Lightfoot, and the number of the ape, in this case, my second tape. Procedures for Vegetation Quadrat Measurements Below is a listing of procedures and values and ranges of values that you should record for each of the variables measured on the vegetation quadrats. IMPORTANT NOTE!!! Be sure to record an entry for all six of the following variables, even if the measurement or count is zero. So, for example, if there are no rabbit feces, record 'rabbit feces count zero' or if there is no termite casing, record 'termite casing zero' etc. Get into a routine of examining each quadrat for each of the 6 variables. For example, start with plant cover, starting with the dominant plant species, then look for leaf litter, then look for cryptogams, then look for soil disturbance, then look for rabbit feces, then look for termite casing. And be sure to record a value for each of the 6 variables for each quadrat. Soil Surface Disturbance from Animals Look for any soil surface disturbance caused by animals (including humans) and measure the cover in terms of 10 cm squares, in increments of no less than 0.1, and the vertical extent of the disturbance in centimeters. Vertical extent includes depth of holes, and height of mounds, often both involved with a particular disturbance. For holes and burrows, measure the depth only as far as you can see. Do not attempt to actually measure to the bottom of the burrow. If you can identify the type of animal that caused the disturbance, state the kind of animal. If you cannot determine what type of animal caused the disturbance, just state 'undetermined soil disturbance.' Record one observation for each type of disturbance on each quadrat. So, pool all cover values for each disturbance type, and record the maximum vertical extent over for all individual disturbances caused by that particular type of animal. Some examples include: ant mounds, rodent digs, rabbit digs, antelope tracks, rabbit tracks, coyote tracks, deer tracks, human footprints, and spider burrows. So, for example, for antelope tracks, state 'soil disturbance from antelope tracks, cover (n), height (n).'

00035-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Introduction. Animal consumers have important roles in ecosystems (Chew 1974, 1976), determining plant species composition and structure (Harper 1969, Pacala and Crawley 1992, Crawley 1983, 1989), regulating rates of plant production and nutrient cycling (Naiman 1988, McNaughton et al. 1989, Holland et al. 1992), and altering soil structure and chemistry (Milchunas et al. 1993, Huntly 1991). Desertification of semi-arid grasslands in the Southwest United States by domestic livestock provides an important example of herbivore regulation of ecosystem structure and function (Schlesinger et al. 1990). The species composition and physical structure of these desert grassland ecosystems were significantly altered by alien herbivores about 100 years ago (Bahre 1991, York and Dick-Peddie 1968, Gardner 1951, Hastings and Turner 1980, Buffington and Herbel 1965, Dick-Peddie 1993). To what extent the spatial patterns of semi-arid shrubland and grassland plant production and soil characteristics are currently controlled by plant resource use, abiotic factors, or consumers is not known. Desertification is an ecosystem-level phenomenon occurring on a global scale with great relevance to human welfare (Nelson 1988). In order to understand the processes that contribute to desertification, we must fully understand interactions among the components of arid-land ecosystems. Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggest that in the absence of continued livestock perturbations, plant resource use and abiotic factors appear to be the principal factors accounting for the persistence of desert shrublands in desertified semi-arid grasslands. However, Brown and Heske (1990a) provide evidence that indigenous small mammal consumers may also have a major role in determining vegetation structure in those desert ecosystems. Brown and Heske (1990a, Heske et al. 1993) found that the exclusion of rodents from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush shrubland areas resulted in a significant increase in grass cover over a 12 year period. Brown and Heske (1990a) concluded that rodents were keystone species in those desert shrub communities, greatly influencing vegetation structure. Rodents are also known to have significant influences on plant species composition and diversity in desert communities (Inouye et al. 1980, Heske et al. 1993, Brown et al. 1986). Several species of granivorous rodents (Family: Heteromidae, genera: Dipodomys, Perognathus, Chaetodipus) appear to have the greatest influence on vegetation herbivory. Soil disturbance through the digging activities of rodents can have profound local effects on plant species composition and vegetation structure in the Chihuahuan Desert (Moroka et al. 1982). Digging activities of desert rodents intermix surface soils with subsurface soils (Abaturov 1972), and increase rainfall infiltration (Soholt 1975). Reported measures of the percentage of desert soil surface areas disturbed by rodent digging activities in desert enviroments range from 10% (Abaturov 1972) to 4.5% (Soholt 1975). Burrowing activities increase local soil nutrient and water status, creating favorable sites for increased plant densities, biomass production, and increased species diversity (Morehead et al. 1989, Mun and Whitford 1990). Rabbits (Lagomorpha: Black-tailed jackrabbits, Lepus californicus, and desert cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus aduboni) are also important consumers of desert vegetation (Brown 1947, Johnson and Anderson 1984, Steinberger and Whitford 1983, Ernest 1994). Rabbits can have significant effects on plant species composition and structure resulting from selective herbivory (Gibbens et al. 1993, Clark and Wagner 1984, Norris 1950, Zeevalking and Fresco 1977). Gibbens et al. (1993) found that excluding rabbits from Chihuahuan Desert creosotebush (Larrea tridentata) communities over a period of 50 years increased the canopy cover of some grasses, and also increased canopy cover of some shrub species. Small mammal (rodent and rabbit) populations may fluctuate considerably with variation in climate and annual plant production (Brown et al. 1979, Brown and Heske 1990, Brown and Zeng 1989, Whitford 1976, Johnson and Anderson 1984). Reproduction in desert rodents is known to be induced by plant foliage production (Reichman and Van De Graff 1975, Beatley 1969). If small mammals are keystone species affecting plant species composition and structure in desert ecosystems, then the impacts of small mammals on vegetation are probably linked with variation in climate and plant production. A reciprocal plant-herbivore/granivore feedback system may result, where small mammal populations and thus impacts on vegetation, are initially determined by climate influences on plant food resource availability to the small mammals. Thus, the effects of small mammals during dry years will probably be different from the effects during wet years because of different population sizes. If this is so, one should be able to measure differential effects of small mammals on plant communities over series of wet or dry years, such as El Nino and La Nina cycles (Nicholls 1988). Such reciprocal interactions should also occur in relation to long-term (decades) climate change. The effects of any one small mammal species population on the biotic community will be complicated by competitive interactions with other mammal species (Munger and Brown 1981, Brown and Zeng 1989, Brown and Heske 1990), however overall impacts on vegetation and soils by the combined effects of all small mammal species may be closely linked with variation in precipitation and plant production. Depending upon the persistence of plant food resources such as foliage or seeds, lag times in consumer impacts may be expected following periods of precipitation and plant production. In desert ecosystems, widely scattered shrubs produce a patch pattern of fertile islands with high plant biomass production and soil nutrients, surrounded by relatively unproductive barren soil (West and Klemmedson 1978, Crawford and Gosz 1982). Researchers at the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research site in New Mexico have proposed a desertification model suggesting that perturbations caused by domestic livestock grazing and climate change initiated processes transforming grasslands with relatively homogeneous resource distributions to shrubland environments with relatively heterogenous resource distributions (Schlesinger et al. 1990). This patchy vegetation/resource distribution pattern is stable under present climate regimes, and appears to be maintained by plant resource use and abiotic soil processes (Schlesinger et al. 1990). However, Wagner (1976, page 195) suggested that small mammals were probably maintaining shrubland dominated ecosystems at the Jornada by suppressing grasses through selective herbivory. Research Hypotheses. The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not the activities of small mammals regulate plant community structure, plant species diversity, and spatial vegetation patterns in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands. What role if any do indigenous small mammal consumers have in maintaining desertified landscapes in the Chihuahuan Desert? Additionally, how do the effects of small mammals interact with changing climate to affect vegetation patterns over time? This study will provide long-term experimental tests of the roles of consumers on ecosystem pattern and process across a latitudinal climate gradient. The following questions or hypotheses will be addressed. 1) Do small mammals influence patterns of plant species composition and diversity, vegetation structure, and spatial patterns of vegetation canopy cover and biomass in Chihuahuan Desert shrublands and grasslands? Are small mammals keystone species that determine plant species composition and physiognomy of Chihuahuan Desert communities as Brown and Heske (1990a) and Gibbens et al. (1993) suggest? Do small mammals have a significant role in maintaining the existence of shrub islands and spatial heterogeneity of creosotebush shrub communities? 2) Do small mammals affect the taxonomic composition and spatial pattern of vegetation similarly or differently in grassland communities as compared to shrub communities? How do patterns compare between grassland and shrubland sites, and how do these relatively small scale patterns relate to overall landscape vegetation patterns? 3) Do small mammals interact with short-term (annual) and long-term (decades) climate change to affect temporal changes in vegetation spatial patterns and species composition? Other Consumers. Ants are important consumers in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991), and granivorous ants are known to have competitive interactions with rodents (Brown and Davidson 1977, Brown et al. 1979) for plant seed resources. Termites are important detritivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (MacKay 1991) and appear to have key roles in plant litter decomposition and nutrient cycling (Whitford et al. 1982, Schaefer and Whitford 1981), and in altering soil structure and hydrologic processes (Elkins et al. 1986). Grasshoppers are important herbivores in Chihuahuan Desert ecosystems (Rivera 1986, Wisdom 1991, Richman et al. 1993), with various species specializing on most of the different plant species present in any location (Otte 1976, Joern 1979). Since manipulations of small mammals will probably affect these arthropod consumers, we will monitor these other consumers on the measurement plots to document any changes. Documentation of changes or lack of changes in ant, termite, and grasshopper consumer groups will be needed to interpret the results of small mammal manipulations on vegetation and soils. For example, if removal of rodents results in an increase of seed-harvesting ants, changes or lack of changes in vegetation and soils may be attributed to compensatory granivory from the increase in ants. Small mammals are the consumer group that appears to have the greatest influence on Chihuahuan Desert communities (see literature citations above). Given the known ecological importance of small mammals and the complexity and difficulties that would be associated with manipulating small mammals and arthropods, we have chosen to start with experiments on small mammals first. If these other consumer groups appear to have important interactions with small mammals, we will pursue additional experiments in the future to focus on those interactions, and to elucidate the ecological roles of these arthropod consumers."

00035-metadata.xml,Supplemental Information,/eml:eml/dataset/additionalInfo,"A creosotebush shrub study site and a black grama grassland study site have been established at each of the Sevilleta, Jornada and Mapimi research locations. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the access road to each site forming the X axis. The compass orientation at the Jornada grassland site is to the north, and Jornada creosotebush site is oriented to the south. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C; control), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R; rodent), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L; lagomorph), and one plot fenced with barbed wire to exclude cattle (Treatment B; bovine). Note that there are cattle exclosure plots only at the Jornada grassland site where cattle are present, for a total of 4 measurement plots at each of the grassland site blocks. There are only 3 measurement plots at each of the creosotebush site blocks. The treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters (see Figure 4). A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner of each plot, and running left to right, then down one row, and then right to left, and so on. A 2-foot rebar marks the lower right corner of each quadrat, and an aluminum tag on the rebar gives the quad number. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. Rodent trapping webs are being used to determine the composition of rodent species at each study site, and to estimate densities of each species over time. The use of webs and distance measures to estimate rodent densities is statistically more robust than grid plot sampling and mark-release indices. Each rodent trapping web consists of a series of 12 equally spaced lines radiating from a central point. Each line consists of 12 trap stations. The first trap station is located 5 meters from the center, the next three at 5 meter intervals, and the remaining 8 at ten meter intervals. Each trap line is 100 meters long, and each web is 200 meters in diameter."

Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus.

00035-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field micro-cassette tape recorders Study Site and Experimental Design Description A creosotebush shrub study site and a black grama grassland study site have been established at each of the Sevilleta, Jornada and Mapimi research locations. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals (see Figures 1 and 2 for diagrams of the two Jornada sites). The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the access road to each site forming the X axis. The compass orientation at the Jornada grassland site is to the north, and Jornada creosotebush site is oriented to the south. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C; control), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R; rodent), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L; lagomorph), and one plot fenced with barbed wire to exclude cattle (Treatment B; bovine). Note that there are cattle exclosure plots only at the Jornada grassland site where cattle are present, for a total of 4 measurement plots at each of the grassland site blocks. There are only 3 measurement plots at each of the creosotebush site blocks. The treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters (see Figure 3). Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters (see Figure 4). A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner of each plot, and running left to right, then down one row, and then right to left, and so on (see Figure 4). A 2-foot rebar marks the lower right corner of each quadrat, and an aluminum tag on the rebar gives the quad number. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. Working on the Study Plots Always avoid walking on the quadrats, and do not walk across plots or anywhere within a block unless absolutely necessary. We are attempting to measure the effects of rodents and rabbits on plants and soils, not the effects of humans. When working on a plot, always walk on a line just below the rebar and quadrats, or on a line to the right of the rebar and quadrats (see dotted lines in Figure 4). Please try to walk gently and flat-footed on the study plots to minimize soil disturbance. When placing the vegetation measurement frame on a quadrat, be careful not to disturb the soil with the frame legs or your feet. When leaning over the measurement frame, be careful not to put your foot on the quadrat. We must measure all human caused disturbances to the soil surface of each quadrat. Vegetation Quadrat Measurements The foliage canopy area and maximum height of each plant species is measured from each quadrat. Several other variables are also measured from each quadrat, including soil surface disturbance, soil surface leaf litter cover, soil surface cryptogam crust cover, termite mud casing, and number of rabbit feces. All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame, which is 1 meter by 1 meter, and partitioned into a grid of 100, 10 cm by 10 cm squares. Cover is measured by counting the number of 10cm squares that are occupied by the foliage canopy of a particular plant species, or by the soil disturbance, leaf litter etc. Portions of the 10 cm squares are also measured, down to 0.1 of a square. Detailed descriptions of measurement techniques are given below for each of the different variables measured. Placement of the vegetation quadrat measurement frame Walk from quadrat to quadrat along the lines mentioned above and marked in Figure 4. When you reach a quadrat, place one leg of the frame immediately next to and touching the 2-foot rebar, over the quadrat. Place the leg for the opposite corner of the frame (from bottom to top of a diamond shape) just inside of the 3-inch nail located at a 315 degree angle from the rebar on the plot X/Y, and compass coordinate system. The frame should be positioned so that the sides are parallel to the sides of the plot and directly over the quadrat, and in line with the rows of rebar (see Figure 4). You may not be able to see the nail, if not, line the sides of the frame with the rows of rebar the best you can. Recording Data You will record the quadrat data into your tape recorder. Each time you start recording data from a new plot (even if you are just helping someone else finish a plot), always start your recording by stating: 'These are vegetation quadrat measurements for the Jornada small mammal exclosure study.' Then state the date (month, day, year), the site (G or C), the block (1,2, 3, or 4), the plot (1, 2, 3, or 4), and the treatment (C, R, or L). If you are helping someone else on a plot, state so, and record who the other person is. Go to the first quadrat you will be taking measurements from, and record the quadrat number (1-36) before you start recording data, by stating 'starting quadrat (n)'. Note that (n) means whatever the appropriate number or letter is. When you are finished recording data for that quadrat, state 'finished with quadrat (n).' Then go on to the next quadrat, and so on. When you have finished collecting data from the plot, state 'finished with quadrat measurements on plot (n), of block (n), at site (n), on (date).' Additional Observations, Corrections, and Comments If you have already recorded data for a variable, e.g., rabbit feces, but while looking over the quadrat later, see some more, you may either make a correction to the previously recorded values, or make another observation (e.g., 'correction, rabbit feces count (n)', or 'rabbit feces count (n).' At any time, if you realize that you recorded incorrect data, just state 'correction, .....' Always start corrections with the statement 'correction'. Do not try to run-back the tape and re-record over mistakes, just state 'correction', and mention the problem. For comments, state 'comment' and then record whatever you want to say about something. Comments are useful if you are uncertain about something, or see something unusual. Try to minimize use of comments though. Checking Your Tape Recordings Be sure to frequently play-back a small portion of your tape to verify that the tape recorder is working properly. Stop and play-back at least at the end of each line of 6 quadrats. Checking your tape after every other quadrat is even better. Labeling Your Tapes Be sure to label your tape, both on the cardboard case insert, and directly on the tape. Use the following format to label your tape: e.g., SMESVQF96-DL2 Where: SMES = small mammal exclosure study VQ = vegetation quadrat data F96 = fall 1996, or S96 for spring 1996 DL2 = initials for your name, in this case Dave Lightfoot, and the number of the ape, in this case, my second tape. Procedures for Vegetation Quadrat Measurements Below is a listing of procedures and values and ranges of values that you should record for each of the variables measured on the vegetation quadrats. IMPORTANT NOTE!!! Be sure to record an entry for all six of the following variables, even if the measurement or count is zero. So, for example, if there are no rabbit feces, record 'rabbit feces count zero' or if there is no termite casing, record 'termite casing zero' etc. Get into a routine of examining each quadrat for each of the 6 variables. For example, start with plant cover, starting with the dominant plant species, then look for leaf litter, then look for cryptogams, then look for soil disturbance, then look for rabbit feces, then look for termite casing. And be sure to record a value for each of the 6 variables for each quadrat. Cryptogam Cover State 'cryptogam cover (n)' for the cover of cryptogam crusts on the soil surface of the quadrat in terms of the 10 cm squares. For cover values less than 5, use increments of 1.0. For cover values greater than 5, use increments of 5.0. Cryptogams include lichens, algae, and moss. Only measure cryptogam cover that is in the open, do not attempt to measure within clumps of grass, etc. Some cryptogam cover has distinctive margins and is easy to define and measure. However, many cryptogam crusts consist of many diffuse small patches that are separated by bare soil, and distributed throughout the quadrat. For such diffuse cover, determine the actual cover in one typical 10 by 10 cm square (e.g., 0.3), then count the number of squares with diffuse cover (e.g., 5), and multiply the number of squares by the actual cover for a typical square (e.g., 0.3 X 5 = 1.5, then round to 1.0 or 2.0, or if the value had been greater than 5, round to the nearest increment of 5.0) for the total cryptogam cover. All cryptogams are pooled into one observation, and no height is measured.

00035-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field micro-cassette tape recorders Study Site and Experimental Design Description A creosotebush shrub study site and a black grama grassland study site have been established at each of the Sevilleta, Jornada and Mapimi research locations. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals (see Figures 1 and 2 for diagrams of the two Jornada sites). The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system, with the access road to each site forming the X axis. The compass orientation at the Jornada grassland site is to the north, and Jornada creosotebush site is oriented to the south. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C; control), one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R; rodent), and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L; lagomorph), and one plot fenced with barbed wire to exclude cattle (Treatment B; bovine). Note that there are cattle exclosure plots only at the Jornada grassland site where cattle are present, for a total of 4 measurement plots at each of the grassland site blocks. There are only 3 measurement plots at each of the creosotebush site blocks. The treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently, and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters (see Figure 3). Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters (see Figure 4). A grid of 36 sampling points are positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The 36 quadrats are numbered 1-36, starting with number 1 in the top left corner of each plot, and running left to right, then down one row, and then right to left, and so on (see Figure 4). A 2-foot rebar marks the lower right corner of each quadrat, and an aluminum tag on the rebar gives the quad number. 3-inch nails were originally placed in the top left corner of each quadrat. These may be difficult to see. A 3-meter wide buffer area is situated between the grid of 36 points and the perimeter of each plot. Working on the Study Plots Always avoid walking on the quadrats, and do not walk across plots or anywhere within a block unless absolutely necessary. We are attempting to measure the effects of rodents and rabbits on plants and soils, not the effects of humans. When working on a plot, always walk on a line just below the rebar and quadrats, or on a line to the right of the rebar and quadrats (see dotted lines in Figure 4). Please try to walk gently and flat-footed on the study plots to minimize soil disturbance. When placing the vegetation measurement frame on a quadrat, be careful not to disturb the soil with the frame legs or your feet. When leaning over the measurement frame, be careful not to put your foot on the quadrat. We must measure all human caused disturbances to the soil surface of each quadrat. Vegetation Quadrat Measurements The foliage canopy area and maximum height of each plant species is measured from each quadrat. Several other variables are also measured from each quadrat, including soil surface disturbance, soil surface leaf litter cover, soil surface cryptogam crust cover, termite mud casing, and number of rabbit feces. All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame, which is 1 meter by 1 meter, and partitioned into a grid of 100, 10 cm by 10 cm squares. Cover is measured by counting the number of 10cm squares that are occupied by the foliage canopy of a particular plant species, or by the soil disturbance, leaf litter etc. Portions of the 10 cm squares are also measured, down to 0.1 of a square. Detailed descriptions of measurement techniques are given below for each of the different variables measured. Placement of the vegetation quadrat measurement frame Walk from quadrat to quadrat along the lines mentioned above and marked in Figure 4. When you reach a quadrat, place one leg of the frame immediately next to and touching the 2-foot rebar, over the quadrat. Place the leg for the opposite corner of the frame (from bottom to top of a diamond shape) just inside of the 3-inch nail located at a 315 degree angle from the rebar on the plot X/Y, and compass coordinate system. The frame should be positioned so that the sides are parallel to the sides of the plot and directly over the quadrat, and in line with the rows of rebar (see Figure 4). You may not be able to see the nail, if not, line the sides of the frame with the rows of rebar the best you can. Recording Data You will record the quadrat data into your tape recorder. Each time you start recording data from a new plot (even if you are just helping someone else finish a plot), always start your recording by stating: 'These are vegetation quadrat measurements for the Jornada small mammal exclosure study.' Then state the date (month, day, year), the site (G or C), the block (1,2, 3, or 4), the plot (1, 2, 3, or 4), and the treatment (C, R, or L). If you are helping someone else on a plot, state so, and record who the other person is. Go to the first quadrat you will be taking measurements from, and record the quadrat number (1-36) before you start recording data, by stating 'starting quadrat (n)'. Note that (n) means whatever the appropriate number or letter is. When you are finished recording data for that quadrat, state 'finished with quadrat (n).' Then go on to the next quadrat, and so on. When you have finished collecting data from the plot, state 'finished with quadrat measurements on plot (n), of block (n), at site (n), on (date).' Additional Observations, Corrections, and Comments If you have already recorded data for a variable, e.g., rabbit feces, but while looking over the quadrat later, see some more, you may either make a correction to the previously recorded values, or make another observation (e.g., 'correction, rabbit feces count (n)', or 'rabbit feces count (n).' At any time, if you realize that you recorded incorrect data, just state 'correction, .....' Always start corrections with the statement 'correction'. Do not try to run-back the tape and re-record over mistakes, just state 'correction', and mention the problem. For comments, state 'comment' and then record whatever you want to say about something. Comments are useful if you are uncertain about something, or see something unusual. Try to minimize use of comments though. Checking Your Tape Recordings Be sure to frequently play-back a small portion of your tape to verify that the tape recorder is working properly. Stop and play-back at least at the end of each line of 6 quadrats. Checking your tape after every other quadrat is even better. Labeling Your Tapes Be sure to label your tape, both on the cardboard case insert, and directly on the tape. Use the following format to label your tape: e.g., SMESVQF96-DL2 Where: SMES = small mammal exclosure study VQ = vegetation quadrat data F96 = fall 1996, or S96 for spring 1996 DL2 = initials for your name, in this case Dave Lightfoot, and the number of the ape, in this case, my second tape. Procedures for Vegetation Quadrat Measurements Below is a listing of procedures and values and ranges of values that you should record for each of the variables measured on the vegetation quadrats. IMPORTANT NOTE!!! Be sure to record an entry for all six of the following variables, even if the measurement or count is zero. So, for example, if there are no rabbit feces, record 'rabbit feces count zero' or if there is no termite casing, record 'termite casing zero' etc. Get into a routine of examining each quadrat for each of the 6 variables. For example, start with plant cover, starting with the dominant plant species, then look for leaf litter, then look for cryptogams, then look for soil disturbance, then look for rabbit feces, then look for termite casing. And be sure to record a value for each of the 6 variables for each quadrat. Cryptogam Cover State 'cryptogam cover (n)' for the cover of cryptogam crusts on the soil surface of the quadrat in terms of the 10 cm squares. For cover values less than 5, use increments of 1.0. For cover values greater than 5, use increments of 5.0. Cryptogams include lichens, algae, and moss. Only measure cryptogam cover that is in the open, do not attempt to measure within clumps of grass, etc. Some cryptogam cover has distinctive margins and is easy to define and measure. However, many cryptogam crusts consist of many diffuse small patches that are separated by bare soil, and distributed throughout the quadrat. For such diffuse cover, determine the actual cover in one typical 10 by 10 cm square (e.g., 0.3), then count the number of squares with diffuse cover (e.g., 5), and multiply the number of squares by the actual cover for a typical square (e.g., 0.3 X 5 = 1.5, then round to 1.0 or 2.0, or if the value had been greater than 5, round to the nearest increment of 5.0) for the total cryptogam cover. All cryptogams are pooled into one observation, and no height is measured.

00036-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Methods for this dataset All aboveground plant biomass data presented herein were from samples collected in the southern half of the chambers. During the period of peak standing phytomass (late July), a metal wire grid containing fifty-six 40.5 3 15.3 cm quadrats (3.46 m2 total) was placed over the south half of each plot and vegetation in every other quadrat (28 quadrats) was clipped to the crown, separated by species, dried at 608C, and weighed. This defoliation protocol, which removed 50% of the green vegetation and represents defoliation by cattle that is intermediate between moderate and heavy grazing practices (Klipple and Costello 1960, Milchunas et al. 1988, 1995), was incorporated into the CO2-treatment experimental design primarily as a means to represent the nominal grazing conditions for these grasslands. In autumn, aboveground phytomass was harvested in all 56 quadrats; weights from the July harvest were combined with this latter one to determine total seasonal productivity for the experimental area. The pattern was reversed the following year; quadrats that had not been clipped the previous summer were clipped at peak standing phytomass, and all quadrats harvested in the autumn. Annual alternation of the small grids that received or did not receive the defoliation during a particular growing season allowed for cycles of ‘‘restfrom- defoliation.’’ The October final harvest involved only senescent shoot material. Phytomass in the northern half of the chambers was defoliated at ;2 cm height in October so that plant cover throughout the chamber was comparable at the beginning and end of each growing season. The northern half of the chamber was used for trace gas flux and other measurements, which are reported elsewhere (Mosier et al. 2002)."

During the period of peak standing phytomass (late July), a metal wire grid containing fifty-six 40.5 3 15.3 cm quadrats (3.46 m2 total) was placed over the south half of each plot and vegetation in every other quadrat (28 quadrats) was clipped to the crown, separated by species, dried at 608C, and weighed. This defoliation protocol, which removed 50% of the green vegetation and represents defoliation by cattle that is intermediate between moderate and heavy grazing practices (Klipple and Costello 1960, Milchunas et al. 1988, 1995), was incorporated into the CO2-treatment experimental design primarily as a means to represent the nominal grazing conditions for these grasslands. In autumn, aboveground phytomass was harvested in all 56 quadrats; weights from the July harvest were combined with this latter one to determine total seasonal productivity for the experimental area. The pattern was reversed the following year; quadrats that had not been clipped the previous summer were clipped at peak standing phytomass, and all quadrats harvested in the autumn. Annual alternation of the small grids that received or did not receive the defoliation during a particular growing season allowed for cycles of ‘‘restfrom- defoliation.’’ The October final harvest involved only senescent shoot material. Phytomass in the northern half of the chambers was defoliated at ;2 cm height in October so that plant cover throughout the chamber was comparable at the beginning and end of each growing season. The northern half of the chamber was used for trace gas flux and other measurements, which are reported elsewhere (Mosier et al. 2002)."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00039-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Water quality samples are being collected using ISCO autosamplers at all wetland sites (that is, all sites except TS/Ph-9, 10, and 11). The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with a YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached. Rain event samples are collected, treated, and analyzed as all other water quality samples."

The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). Collection of composite samples may result in a composite sample which is less than three days; samples are collected every 3-4 weeks. The recorded date for each composite sample indicates the end date of the sample interval. Samples are analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 um) immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

Glass slides were used as artificial substrates for periphyton growth. Twenty slides were incubated for 2 months in triplicate periphytometers (flow-through plastic boxes) at the surface (SRS sites) and bottom (FB) at each site. Twelve artificial blades (made from transparency film) were incubated for 2 months in triplicate in specially constructed wire frames at the bottom at sites TS/PH 9, TS/PH 10 and TS/PH 11. Data are presented in terms of grams dry and ash-free dry mass per area per time. This is part of continuous data collection to test the hypothesis that phosphorus and nitrogen limit productivity at the upstream and downstream ends, respectively, of the FCE transects. Conclusions await longer-term data collection."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park. There are a total of 21 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle.-81.07794623-80.4897820725.7614517124.912934922000-05-012006-04-30FCE LTER II: Coastal Oligotrophic Ecosystems ResearchEvelynGaiserFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkOE 148MiamiFL33199USA305-348-6145305-348-4096gaisere@fiu.eduLead Principal InvestigatorMikeHeithausFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of Biological SciencesMarine Biology ProgramFlorida International UniversityBiscayne Bay CampusMiamiFL33181USA(305) 919-5234(305) 919-4030heithaus@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorRudolfJaffeFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of ChemistryFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkCP 304MiamiFL33199USA305-348-2456305-348-4096jaffer@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorRenePriceFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of Earth SciencesFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkPC 34411200 SW 8th StreetMiamiFL33199USA305-348-3119305-348-3877pricer@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorOur FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00041-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Digestion Procedure and Analytical Methods In the laboratory, lichen thalli of approximately 6-8 cm in diameter were selected, removed from the rock substrate with plastic forceps and cleaned thoroughly using nano-pure water. This cleaning step removed most of the surficial particulates, though some remaining particles had to be removed by sonication. The cleaned thalli were stored in nitric acid-washed glass beakers until air-dry. To minimize intrathalline and interthalline elemental variation at each sampling, the lichen material was then frozen with liquid nitrogen, crushed in a clean mortar and pestel, and homogenized. Initial experiments tested elemental recoveries of different digestion procedures. For the lichen samples, conventional wet digestion procedures, using concentrated nitric acid and hydrochloric acid digestion, was selected as the best procedure. The accuracy of the digestion procedure was checked against the lichen standard L0002 of Dr. Jean Carignan, France. All lab ware was cleaned for 48 h in a 10% nitric acid bath, and then rinsed three times in nanopure water to minimize metal contamination. Lichen material from each location was subdivided into three replicates of 0.1 g each (oven dry weight), and transferred into 15 ml screw-top teflon vials with 5 ml of 14 M nitric acid (Ultrex). First, the vials closed loosely and fluxed at 80°C on a hot plate in a fume hood. After fuming, the vials were closed tightly, and the samples digested overnight at 160°C. These samples were evaporated at 160°C to near dryness and redissolved in 1 ml of 12 M HCl (Ultrex) and 1 ml of 14 M HNO3 (Ultrex). These samples were again refluxed at 80°C, dried at 160°C to near dryness, and resuspended in a final mixture of 1 ml of 6 M HCl (Ultrex) and 2 ml of 7 M HNO3 (Ultrex). This suspension containing the free metals was refluxed at 80°C for approximately 30 min and then gravimetrically brought to a volume of 20 ml. Before quantitative analysis, samples were spiked with 1 ml of an indium internal calibration standard. Elemental concentrations for a suite of 28 trace metals (antimony [Sb], cadmium [Cd], cerium [Ce], chromium [Cr], cobalt [Co], copper [Cu], dysprosium [Dy], europium [Eu], gadolinium [Gd], gold [Au], holmium [Ho], lead [Pb], lutetium [Lu], neodymium [Nd], nickel [Ni], palladium [Pd], platinum [Pt], praseodymium [Pr], samarium [Sm], scandium [Sc], silver [Ag], terbium [Tb], thulium [Tm], tin [Sn], uranium [U], ytterbium [Yb], yttrium [Y], and zinc [Zn]) in each sample was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The ICP-MS was run in the peak jump mode counting at key masses per element and scanning only for a select number of isotopes. This helped to reduce potential interferences and also reduced analysis time. Blanks were run along the entire sample preparation procedure and were uniformly much lower than the replicates from the same location."

To minimize intrathalline and interthalline elemental variation at each sampling, the lichen material was then frozen with liquid nitrogen, crushed in a clean mortar and pestel, and homogenized. Initial experiments tested elemental recoveries of different digestion procedures. For the lichen samples, conventional wet digestion procedures, using concentrated nitric acid and hydrochloric acid digestion, was selected as the best procedure. The accuracy of the digestion procedure was checked against the lichen standard L0002 of Dr. Jean Carignan, France. All lab ware was cleaned for 48 h in a 10% nitric acid bath, and then rinsed three times in nanopure water to minimize metal contamination. Lichen material from each location was subdivided into three replicates of 0.1 g each (oven dry weight), and transferred into 15 ml screw-top teflon vials with 5 ml of 14 M nitric acid (Ultrex). First, the vials closed loosely and fluxed at 80°C on a hot plate in a fume hood. After fuming, the vials were closed tightly, and the samples digested overnight at 160°C. These samples were evaporated at 160°C to near dryness and redissolved in 1 ml of 12 M HCl (Ultrex) and 1 ml of 14 M HNO3 (Ultrex). These samples were again refluxed at 80°C, dried at 160°C to near dryness, and resuspended in a final mixture of 1 ml of 6 M HCl (Ultrex) and 2 ml of 7 M HNO3 (Ultrex). This suspension containing the free metals was refluxed at 80°C for approximately 30 min and then gravimetrically brought to a volume of 20 ml. Before quantitative analysis, samples were spiked with 1 ml of an indium internal calibration standard. Elemental concentrations for a suite of 28 trace metals (antimony [Sb], cadmium [Cd], cerium [Ce], chromium [Cr], cobalt [Co], copper [Cu], dysprosium [Dy], europium [Eu], gadolinium [Gd], gold [Au], holmium [Ho], lead [Pb], lutetium [Lu], neodymium [Nd], nickel [Ni], palladium [Pd], platinum [Pt], praseodymium [Pr], samarium [Sm], scandium [Sc], silver [Ag], terbium [Tb], thulium [Tm], tin [Sn], uranium [U], ytterbium [Yb], yttrium [Y], and zinc [Zn]) in each sample was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The ICP-MS was run in the peak jump mode counting at key masses per element and scanning only for a select number of isotopes. This helped to reduce potential interferences and also reduced analysis time. Blanks were run along the entire sample preparation procedure and were uniformly much lower than the replicates from the same location."

Also to examine patterns of coarse dry particulate deposition across the study area and provide some minimum estimates on levels of dry deposition of these ions. We were particularly interested to answer the question: 'To what extent are concentrations and fluxes of these ions enhanced at sites within the urban core relative to undeveloped desert sites upwind and downwind of the city'. Currently we operate eight wet-dry collectors located to form a transect running approximately W-E across the study area from outlying desert to the west, upwind of the prevailing synoptic wind direction, through agriculture to urban core sites, to two downwind sites in the desert to the east and northeast (map of bucket locations). Collectors are co-located at sites of Maricopa County or Arizona Department of Environmental Quality monitoring stations wherever possible."

00044-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Atmospheric Deposition Lab Preparation Atmospheric Deposition Sample Processing / Filtering DRY BUCKETS Open the bucket and remove any contamination (insects, bird droppings) Add 250 ml of nanopure water. Use a rinsed 250ml graduated cylinder. Secure the lid tightly. Shake the bucket every half hour to hour for 2 to 4 hours. Leave the bucket in the cold room overnight. Take out the bucket in the morning and repeat the shaking step. Skip the weighing step and follow the procedure for wet buckets. WET BUCKETS WEIGH Weigh the bucket in PSH 470. Wipe any soil/debris off the outside of the bucket first. Tare the scale and weigh the bucket. Record on the field sheet. POUR the sample from the bucket into an HCl washed 500ml bottle. Be Careful. If there is less than 100ml of sample you may want to pour it into a 125ml HCL washed bottle. AMMONIA Pour out a small amount of the sample, about 6 ml, enough to rinse and fill a traacs cup, into a HCl washed centrifuge tube. Rinse the tube first. DOC Using the small HCl rinsed 25mm filter apparatus filter enough sample, about 15ml, for DOC analysis. Use an ashed 25mm GF/F filter. There are some in the desiccator in the room behind the traacs room in Goldwater. Rinse the filter apparatus with nanopure. Insert a filter and rinse the ashed filter with nanopure water. Discard. Rinse the filter and flask with the sample. Discard. Filter about 15 ml. Rinse an HCl washed scintillation vial (blue cap) with a little of the filtered sample and pour the rest into the vial Acidify with one drop of concentrated HCl or acidify in the DOC tube according to the DOC method before the run. I tend to like the latter. ANIONS and CATIONS (SEE NOTE below) Filter the rest of the sample through a Supor-450 47mm membrane filter (0.45micrometer filter) Rinse the filter apparatus and filter as in the DOC filtering. Pour most of the sample (or fill) a HCl rinsed 125ml. You should at least fill the bottle half way if you can. Be sure to rinse the bottle with a little of the sample first. Pour about 30ml (or as much as left) into a 125ml HNO3 rinsed 125ml bottle (in the metal cabinet in the room behind the traacs room). *NOTE* The amount of sample poured into each bottle for anions and cations may differ depending on the amount of sample. If after pouring the ammonia and DOC sample there is less than 50ml of sample do not pour any of the sample into a HNO3 bottle for cations. If there is >50 ml pour 30ml into the HCl bottle and 20ml into the HNO3 bottle. If there is in between 50 and 100ml, pour the sample into the bottles in the ratio of 3:2, HCl:HNO3. Acidify the cations. Tare the scale with an empty bottle and then weigh all of the bottles. Add 0.893 ml of ultrapure nitric acid for every 125ml of sample. You can multiply the weight by 7.144 (893/725) for the microliters of acid to add. Field Sample Collection / Site Visit (updated by D. Hope 22/2/2001) Supplies: buckets (weighed, bagged and labelled), lids (weighed, bagged and labelled), voltmeter/battery tester, 12V batteries (w/ thumbscrews) for 4 sites (Palo Verde, Duncan Family Farms, Sycamore Creek) field book, sharpie, kimwipes, paper towels, water bottle, cooler, duct tape, electrical tape, mineral oil Field Procedure/Sampling Schedule Dry buckets are changed monthly, all on the same day. This includes the dry-side bucket at the NLTER31ATMDEPs collector at Organ Pipe National Monument. Our contact for doing that there is Biological Research Technician Amy Pate  tel: 520-387-7661 ext 7111. She rebags and stores the sample buckets, which should be collected from her every 2-3 months and brought back to Goldwater Lab for processing. On these collection trips, she should also be supplied with 3-4 clean bagged and weighed buckets and lids and a new field sheet. Wet buckets are collected/changed according to the following rules: Collect a sample after EVERY significant rainfall event at EVERY sitewhere it rained (greater or equal 0.25 rain in 24 hour period) IF THIS NOT POSSIBLE AND 30% or greater chance of more rain, collect the day after - OR COLLECT WITHIN 48 hrs of end of significant rainfall (DO NOT to let wet samples greater or equal 0.25 sit for more than 48 hrs IF POSSIBLE) in which case collect at next soonest opportunity. If NOT possible to collect at ALL sites with significant rainfall, priorities for sampling are: Phoenix Supersite Brooks Road Lost Dutchman Sycamore Creek If in doubt  preference is for sample to be prepped and wait in cold room for analysis rather than sitting in bucket out in field waiting to be collected. ** Be careful not to contaminate the old or new bucket.** **Note any signs of contamination: bird droppings, insects, etc.** Changing Both Buckets 1. If changing both buckets take both buckets off before putting either new bucket on. Do any work on or around the collector, then put the clean buckets in last. 2. While both buckets are off: Wipe the top side of the roof and sensor to remove bird droppings or other accumulations that could be blown into the sample bucket. Use a clean sponge, clean lint free cloth, or wet kimwipe to wipe the underside of the lid seal. After the lid seal has dried replace the buckets with the clean buckets. Note which surfaces have been cleaned. Changing the wet side bucket: 1. Approach the collector from the down wind side. Inspect the site for any damage. 2. Check the temperature of the sensor. It should be cool unless the collector has been open within the last several minutes. 3. Inspect the dry side bucket for any signs of precipitation. 4. Short out the sensor with a few drops of water. 5. Watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. The lid seal pad should rest snugly on the dry side bucket. 6. Examine the wet side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Make detailed notes of any signs of contamination. 7. Using the bag the lid is in as gloves, place the lid on to the wet side bucket 8. Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly. 9. On the field sheet and the outside of the bag note the bucket side, site, date, time off, and presence of any contamination. 10. Using the bag as gloves place the new wet side bucket in the bucket holder. 11. Check the sensor to see if it is hot to the touch. Blow off any excess water so the lid will move back to the dry side. 12. Place the collected, covered bucket into the bag the clean bucket was in and set the bucket inside of the bag in the cooler. Keep the AC on the field vehicle until back at the lab. Changing the dry side bucket: Follow steps 1-3, and 6  10 of changing the wet side bucket. If the sample is spilled or bucket dropped at any time make a note. Especially, if the rim of the bucket or lid contacts any surfaces. If the collector sensor or motor is not working and the battery has charge then the collector should be put in a bulk sample mode. If the motor box will move the lid, activate the sensor. When the lid is on top of the dry side bucket and just starting to compress the foam pad disconnect the collector from the power source. If the collector motor box will not move the lid, reach under the main frame of the collector and push the clutch arm counter-clockwise. The clutch will disengage and the lid mechanism will be free of the drive system. Manually position the lid over the dry side bucket and use the bucket retaining springs to secure the lid. Disconnect the collector from the power supply. Rain Gauge: Record the amount of rain. Empty the rain gauge and then pour mineral oil in it to a depth of about 1mm.] While both buckets are off: 1. Wipe the top side of the roof and sensor to remove bird droppings or other accumulations that could be blown into the sample bucket. 2. Use a clean sponge, clean lint free cloth, or wet kimwipe to wipe the underside of the lid seal. 3. After the lid seal has dried replace the buckets with the clean buckets. 4. The underside of the lid should be inspected for cracks or deterioration every time the bucket collection is done. If the plastic has become brittle and cracked, it should be replaced as soon as possible  see the NLTER31ATMDEP Site Operation Manual for instructions. If the collector sensor, motor or battery is not working and the lid has stuck allowing water in the dry or both sides, pour all sample into the dry bucket and record on the field sheet that this is a bulk sample (ie. wet and dry deposition combined). If the collector motor box will not move the lid, reach under the main frame of the collector and push the clutch arm counter-clockwise. The clutch will disengage and the lid mechanism will be free of the drive system. Manually position the lid over the dry side bucket and use the bucket retaining springs to secure the lid. Disconnect the collector from the power supply. Belfort rain gauge (if in use  not installed at CAP sites as of 22nd Feb 2001) 1. Open the rain gauge sliding access door and move the pens up and down to mark their position on the chart. Move the pen shifter outward to move the pens away from the chart. 2. Remove the chart and chart drum (thumbscrew on the top of chart drum). Note time and date in the appropriate place on the chart. 3. Check the event pen tracing to be sure the collector opened and closed with each precipitation event. 4. Empty the catch bucket. 5. Record the time of the chart change and install it on the chart drum. Be sure the chart starts just to the right of the chart clip and the chart is flush with the flange on the bottom of the chart drum. 6. Turn the chart clockwise past the real time and then counter clockwise back to the desired starting point 7. Check the level of ink in the pens and replace if necessary. If the lines on the chart are very light or smeared use kimwipes or tissue paper to absorb the ink out of the pen and replace it. 8. Push the bucket down gently and release. Check to make sure the pen is working properly and returns to its original starting position. This should be zero but if the pen is slightly high it may be best not to adjust the zero as this could cause the pen to drop below the zero line during the cycle 9. Be sure the event recorder pen moves up when the lid of the collector is over the wet side bucket. Field Sample Collection / Site Visit (updated by D.

Use a clean sponge, clean lint free cloth, or wet kimwipe to wipe the underside of the lid seal. After the lid seal has dried replace the buckets with the clean buckets. Note which surfaces have been cleaned. Changing the wet side bucket: 1. Approach the collector from the down wind side. Inspect the site for any damage. 2. Check the temperature of the sensor. It should be cool unless the collector has been open within the last several minutes. 3. Inspect the dry side bucket for any signs of precipitation. 4. Short out the sensor with a few drops of water. 5. Watch the roof to see if it moves freely and evenly with little motor noise. The lid seal pad should rest snugly on the dry side bucket. 6. Examine the wet side bucket carefully for contamination such as soil, insects, bird droppings, etc. Make detailed notes of any signs of contamination. 7. Using the bag the lid is in as gloves, place the lid on to the wet side bucket 8. Remove the bucket and lid from the collector, and snap the lid on tightly. 9. On the field sheet and the outside of the bag note the bucket side, site, date, time off, and presence of any contamination. 10. Using the bag as gloves place the new wet side bucket in the bucket holder. 11. Check the sensor to see if it is hot to the touch. Blow off any excess water so the lid will move back to the dry side. 12. Place the collected, covered bucket into the bag the clean bucket was in and set the bucket inside of the bag in the cooler. Keep the AC on the field vehicle until back at the lab. Changing the dry side bucket: Follow steps 1-3, and 6  10 of changing the wet side bucket. If the sample is spilled or bucket dropped at any time make a note. Especially, if the rim of the bucket or lid contacts any surfaces. If the collector sensor or motor is not working and the battery has charge then the collector should be put in a bulk sample mode. If the motor box will move the lid, activate the sensor. When the lid is on top of the dry side bucket and just starting to compress the foam pad disconnect the collector from the power source. If the collector motor box will not move the lid, reach under the main frame of the collector and push the clutch arm counter-clockwise. The clutch will disengage and the lid mechanism will be free of the drive system. Manually position the lid over the dry side bucket and use the bucket retaining springs to secure the lid. Disconnect the collector from the power supply. Rain Gauge: Record the amount of rain. Empty the rain gauge and then pour mineral oil in it to a depth of about 1mm.] While both buckets are off: 1. Wipe the top side of the roof and sensor to remove bird droppings or other accumulations that could be blown into the sample bucket. 2. Use a clean sponge, clean lint free cloth, or wet kimwipe to wipe the underside of the lid seal. 3. After the lid seal has dried replace the buckets with the clean buckets. 4. The underside of the lid should be inspected for cracks or deterioration every time the bucket collection is done. If the plastic has become brittle and cracked, it should be replaced as soon as possible  see the NLTER31ATMDEP Site Operation Manual for instructions. If the collector sensor, motor or battery is not working and the lid has stuck allowing water in the dry or both sides, pour all sample into the dry bucket and record on the field sheet that this is a bulk sample (ie. wet and dry deposition combined). If the collector motor box will not move the lid, reach under the main frame of the collector and push the clutch arm counter-clockwise. The clutch will disengage and the lid mechanism will be free of the drive system. Manually position the lid over the dry side bucket and use the bucket retaining springs to secure the lid. Disconnect the collector from the power supply. Belfort rain gauge (if in use  not installed at CAP sites as of 22nd Feb 2001) 1. Open the rain gauge sliding access door and move the pens up and down to mark their position on the chart. Move the pen shifter outward to move the pens away from the chart. 2. Remove the chart and chart drum (thumbscrew on the top of chart drum). Note time and date in the appropriate place on the chart. 3. Check the event pen tracing to be sure the collector opened and closed with each precipitation event. 4. Empty the catch bucket. 5. Record the time of the chart change and install it on the chart drum. Be sure the chart starts just to the right of the chart clip and the chart is flush with the flange on the bottom of the chart drum. 6. Turn the chart clockwise past the real time and then counter clockwise back to the desired starting point 7. Check the level of ink in the pens and replace if necessary. If the lines on the chart are very light or smeared use kimwipes or tissue paper to absorb the ink out of the pen and replace it. 8. Push the bucket down gently and release. Check to make sure the pen is working properly and returns to its original starting position. This should be zero but if the pen is slightly high it may be best not to adjust the zero as this could cause the pen to drop below the zero line during the cycle 9. Be sure the event recorder pen moves up when the lid of the collector is over the wet side bucket. Field Sample Collection / Site Visit (updated by D. Hope 22/2/2001) Supplies: buckets (weighed, bagged and; labelled), lids (weighed, bagged and labelled), voltmeter/battery tester, 12V batteries (w/ thumbscrews) for 4 sites (Palo Verde, Duncan Family Farms, Sycamore Creek) field book, sharpie, kimwipes, paper towels, water bottle, cooler, duct tape, electrical tape, mineral oil Field Procedure/Sampling Schedule Dry buckets are changed monthly, all on the same day. This includes the dry-side bucket at the NLTER31ATMDEPs collector at Organ Pipe National Monument. Our contact for doing that there is Biological Research Technician Amy Pate  tel: 520-387-7661 ext 7111. She rebags and stores the sample buckets, which should be collected from her every 2-3 months and brought back to Goldwater Lab for processing. On these collection trips, she should also be supplied with 3-4 clean bagged and weighed buckets and lids and a new field sheet. Wet buckets are collected/changed according to the following rules: Collect a sample after EVERY significant rainfall event at EVERY sitewhere it rained (>/= 0.25 rain in 24 hour period) IF THIS NOT POSSIBLE AND 30% or greater chance of more rain, collect the day after - OR COLLECT WITHIN 48 hrs of end of significant rainfall (DO NOT to let wet samples >/=0.25 sit for >48 hrs IF POSSIBLE) in which case collect at next soonest opportunity. If NOT possible to collect at ALL sites with significant rainfall, priorities for sampling are: Phoenix Supersite Brooks Road Lost Dutchman Sycamore Creek If in doubt  preference is for sample to be prepped and wait in cold room for analysis rather than sitting in bucket out in field waiting to be collected. ** Be careful not to contaminate the old or new bucket.** **Note any signs of contamination: bird droppings, insects, etc.** Changing Both Buckets 1. If changing both buckets take both buckets off before putting either new bucket on. Do any work on or around the collector, then put the clean buckets in last. 2. While both buckets are off: Wipe the top side of the roof and sensor to remove bird droppings or other accumulations that could be blown into the sample bucket.

00045-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We deployed three eddy covariance towers with identical instrumentation across a burn severity gradient (Rocha and Shaver 2009). The three sites (i.e. Severe burn, Moderate burn, and Unburned) were 40 km to the west of the nearest road and were selected during a helicopter survey of the southern area of the Anaktuvuk River Fire scar in late May 2008 (Figure 1; Table 1). Because the fire had burned through September of the previous year, initial deployment of flux towers occurred prior to any significant vegetative regrowth, and our sampling campaign captured the full 2008 growing season (June 1-August 28). Each site was equipped with a Campbell Scientific® CR5000 datalogger that recorded data from micrometeorological instrumentation located on a stainless steel tripod (CM110; Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA) at a height of 2.6 m. Data were stored on a 2 Gb PCMCIA card and downloaded every two to three weeks. Power for the datalogger and instrumentation was located 15 m to the east or west of the tower and consisted of a south-facing solar panel and two 12 V 80 amp-hour batteries enclosed in a polyethylene box. Towers ran continuously through the summer of 2008 with the exception of the severe burn site, which was damaged by a bear during the last week of August. The towers have been in operation since June 2008. Environmental data were recorded as half hour averages. Net radiation was monitored with a NRLITE net radiometer (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA). Incoming and reflected solar and longwave radiation were measured with a CNR-1 Radiometer (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA), while incoming and reflected Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) were measured with a silicon quantum sensor (LI-COR; Lincoln, NE, USA). Air temperature and relative humidity was measured with an HMP45C-L sensor (Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA) enclosed in a naturally aspirated radiation shield, while precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge (TE525; Campbell Scientific; Logan Utah, USA). Volumetric water content at a depth of 2.5 cm was measured with two reflectometers (CS616; Campbell Scientfic; Logan Utah, USA), soil temperature at a depth of 2 and 6 cm was measured with two averaging soil thermocouples (TCAV-L; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA), and soil heat flux at a depth of 8 cm was measured with four soil heat flux plates (HFP01; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA). Measurements of the soil environment were recorded on separate CR1000 dataloggers at the severely and moderately burned sites. Turbulent fluxes of momentum, sensible heat, latent heat and CO2 were determined by the eddy covariance technique (Baldocchi et al. 1988). Half hourly CO2 and H2O fluxes were calculated as the covariance between the turbulent departures from the mean of the 10 Hz vertical wind speed measured with a 3D sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific; Logan, Utah, USA) and the CO2 and H2O mixing ratio measured with an open path InfraRed Gas Analyzer (IRGA; LI7500; LI-COR; Lincoln, NE, USA). Fluxes were processed using EdiRe software (University of Edinburgh; Moncrieff et al. 1997) and reported using the meteorological sign convention where negative NEE indicates carbon uptake and positive NEE indicates carbon loss from the ecosystem. Ten Hz data were despiked, rotated to the mean wind streamlines, and corrected for the density effect due to sensible heat transfer (i.e. WPL correction; Webb et al. 1980). Turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat captured 78 to 80% of the available energy at each of the sites, which is consistent with energy budget closure observed for other eddy covariance studies (Wilson et al. 2002). The moderate burn site is comprised of a mosaic of partially and completely burnt moss patches scattered across the landscape that varied in size from ~1 to 10 m2. Partially burnt moss cover was 33% and was dominated by Sphagnum [Sphagnum spp.] and feather mosses [Hylocomium spp.]. Recovering and dead tussocks formed the dominant canopy cover. Intertussock area was composed of burnt duff (30% of ground cover) and several herbaceous species (Cloudberry; Labrador tea, and Cranberry [Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.]). All tussocks were scorched in the fire and 95% of tussocks recovered after the first growing season. References: Rocha, A.V. and G.R.

00046-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"By studying vegetation leafing phenology and its coupling with climate along the urban-rural gradient in Phoenix metropolitan region, USA, we elucidated the degree of urbanization-induced transformations of phenology and primary productivity. In this study we used time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spatially interpolated rainfall. Our analyses were stratified by major land covers and dominant soil texture. We also assessed time scales at which NDVI responds most strongly to climatic factors. No distinctive patterns in phenology were found along the urban-rural gradient; however some important generalities were confirmed. Agricultural and urban developments introduce growth multimodality, which is not attributable to desert but customarily found in riparian ecosystems of the area. Despite the existence of summer flush of growth in the desert its signal is not detected by de-noised satellite data. Urban and agricultural vegetation is characterized by fast growth and senescence rates. While agriculture has the shortest growth length, most urban vegetation stays photosynthetically active for longer periods. Growth in the desert is controlled by precipitation accumulated for 2-5 months. Spatial patterns of NDVI are predicted by precipitation grids. Positive relationship between these two variables changes seasonally reaching the maximum near the peak of annual growth. Spring and summer NDVI grids are in better agreement with longer term accumulated precipitation, but the early autumn growth is correlated more with immediate rainfall. Spatial and temporal correlations of desert NDVI with temperature are negative confirming the role of temperature in stimulating water loss from the soil. Our results supported the hypothesis that coarse-textured soils limit evaporative losses of soil water and promote growth. Riparian NDVI are moderately positively correlated with temperature but only weakly with precipitation. NDVI dynamics in urban and agricultural land covers are completely unsynchronized with natural vegetation communities and decoupled with precipitation. They exhibit positive, yet low, correlation with temperature. Overall, urbanization adds a greater diversity of phenological patterns that are not determined by climatic variability. Instead, urban and agricultural vegetation dynamics is expected to be explained largely by socio-economic variables."

NDVI is computed from reflectance data corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption and aerosols, and adjusted to nadir and Sun angles with the use of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BDRF) models (Huete et al. 1999, van Leeuwen et al. 1999). The index is based on the property of green vegetation to strongly absorb red and reflect near-infrared wavelengths, and is calculated as (Tucker 1979, Huete et al. 1999): NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED) where NIR is MODIS band 2 (841-846 nm) and RED is MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm). Final 16-day maximum composites are produced by combining multiple days and filtering out clouds and data with bad integrity. We obtained 250-m NDVI images (MOD13Q1 product) for 2000-2005 and examined data using quality flags from companion Quality Assurance (QA) images. Recognizing the existence of multiple methods for modeling phenology (Olsson and Eklundh 1994, Moulin et al. 1997, White et al. 1997, Moody and Johnson 2001, Reed et al. 2003, de Beurs and Henebry 2005, Bradley et al. 2007, Soudani et al. 2008), we chose to use TIMESAT (Jönsson and Eklundh 2006) to de-noise NDVI time-series and extract seasonality parameters. TIMESAT implements three processing methods based on least-squares fits to the upper envelope of NDVI time-series, accounting for negatively biased noise (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Data fitting with local polynomial functions classified as adaptive Savitsky-Golay filtering was preferred in our study. It most closely corresponded to raw NDVI data during calibration and method testing. Three adaptation runs were executed with search window set to 2, 3, and 4 consecutive NDVI values. Start and end of growth periods were defined as a 20% increase or decrease in NDVI values. The TIMESAT software is available online: TIMESAT Software"

Study Area: The main meteorological exclosure is in Section 27NE. The equipment is contained in an ungrazed area of section 27 on the Central Plains Experimental Range. This exclosure contains other equipment for other monitoring programs such as NADP and UVB. The vegetation is typical for upland grasslands, dominated by Bouteloua gracilis. Outside the exclosure, the rangeland is grazed from April - October. In addition to the main LTER met statin, recording raingages are located in the following CPER locations: (1) section 25NE, (2) Section 15SE, (3) Owl Creek exclosure in Section 11, and at the CSU hq in Section 21-SW. These gauges are functional from early March through October. Observations of maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation were recorded daily. Beginning June 24, 1970, other observations were added periodically, including wet and dry bulb temperatures, maximum and minimum pan temperatures, and pan evaporation. Atmometer (potential evaporation) readings were added July 4, 1985. Pan temperatures and evaporation are taken seasonally when temperatures are above freezing. A daily index on wind type, hail size, snow cover, and cloud cover is included when appropriate."

Study Area: The main meteorological exclosure is in Section 27NE. The equipment is contained in an ungrazed area of section 27 on the Central Plains Experimental Range. This exclosure contains other equipment for other monitoring programs such as NADP and UVB. The vegetation is typical for upland grasslands, dominated by Bouteloua gracilis. Outside the exclosure, the rangeland is grazed from April - October. In addition to the main LTER met statin, recording raingages are located in the following CPER locations: (1) section 25NE, (2) Section 15SE, (3) Owl Creek exclosure in Section 11, and at the CSU hq in Section 21-SW. These gauges are functional from early March through October. Observations of maximum and minimum air temperatures and precipitation were recorded daily. Beginning June 24, 1970, other observations were added periodically, including wet and dry bulb temperatures, maximum and minimum pan temperatures, and pan evaporation. Atmometer (potential evaporation) readings were added July 4, 1985. Pan temperatures and evaporation are taken seasonally when temperatures are above freezing. A daily index on wind type, hail size, snow cover, and cloud cover is included when appropriate."

The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus.

00049-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"By studying vegetation leafing phenology and its coupling with climate along the urban-rural gradient in Phoenix metropolitan region, USA, we elucidated the degree of urbanization-induced transformations of phenology and primary productivity. In this study we used time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and spatially interpolated rainfall. Our analyses were stratified by major land covers and dominant soil texture. We also assessed time scales at which NDVI responds most strongly to climatic factors. No distinctive patterns in phenology were found along the urban-rural gradient; however some important generalities were confirmed. Agricultural and urban developments introduce growth multimodality, which is not attributable to desert but customarily found in riparian ecosystems of the area. Despite the existence of summer flush of growth in the desert its signal is not detected by de-noised satellite data. Urban and agricultural vegetation is characterized by fast growth and senescence rates. While agriculture has the shortest growth length, most urban vegetation stays photosynthetically active for longer periods. Growth in the desert is controlled by precipitation accumulated for 2-5 months. Spatial patterns of NDVI are predicted by precipitation grids. Positive relationship between these two variables changes seasonally reaching the maximum near the peak of annual growth. Spring and summer NDVI grids are in better agreement with longer term accumulated precipitation, but the early autumn growth is correlated more with immediate rainfall. Spatial and temporal correlations of desert NDVI with temperature are negative confirming the role of temperature in stimulating water loss from the soil. Our results supported the hypothesis that coarse-textured soils limit evaporative losses of soil water and promote growth. Riparian NDVI are moderately positively correlated with temperature but only weakly with precipitation. NDVI dynamics in urban and agricultural land covers are completely unsynchronized with natural vegetation communities and decoupled with precipitation. They exhibit positive, yet low, correlation with temperature. Overall, urbanization adds a greater diversity of phenological patterns that are not determined by climatic variability. Instead, urban and agricultural vegetation dynamics is expected to be explained largely by socio-economic variables."

NDVI is computed from reflectance data corrected for molecular scattering, ozone absorption and aerosols, and adjusted to nadir and Sun angles with the use of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BDRF) models (Huete et al. 1999, van Leeuwen et al. 1999). The index is based on the property of green vegetation to strongly absorb red and reflect near-infrared wavelengths, and is calculated as (Tucker 1979, Huete et al. 1999): NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED) where NIR is MODIS band 2 (841-846 nm) and RED is MODIS band 1 (620-670 nm). Final 16-day maximum composites are produced by combining multiple days and filtering out clouds and data with bad integrity. We obtained 250-m NDVI images (MOD13Q1 product) for 2000-2005 and examined data using quality flags from companion Quality Assurance (QA) images.

TIMESAT implements three processing methods based on least-squares fits to the upper envelope of NDVI time-series, accounting for negatively biased noise (Jönsson and Eklundh 2004). Data fitting with local polynomial functions classified as adaptive Savitsky-Golay filtering was preferred in our study. It most closely corresponded to raw NDVI data during calibration and method testing. Three adaptation runs were executed with search window set to 2, 3, and 4 consecutive NDVI values. Start and end of growth periods were defined as a 20% increase or decrease in NDVI values. The rate of growth is calculated as the ratio between NDVI values at the beginning of growth period those NDVI values at the 80% level of growth divided by the corresponding time difference (in days).

00050-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Prairie dogs are keystone species that impact both animals and plants in grassland habitats. They are a food resource for secondary consumers such as badgers, foxes, and raptors. Also, the mounds that they construct are home to many arthropod and reptile species that otherwise might not survive in grasslands. Both Gunnison’s and black-tailed prairie dogs can increase the number of plant species in grasslands and landscape heterogeneity with their ecosystem engineering that creates disturbed patches on the landscape. Gunnison’s prairie dogs, which were native herbivores at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) before their populations disappeared, were reintroduced at the Sevilleta NWR in 1997, 2005, and 2008. In 1998, a Gunnison’s prairie dog colony naturally established along the northern border on the east side of the Refuge. The naturally occurring colony and the colony that was reintroduced in 1997 have since then severely declined or gone locally extinct. Still, with the removal of cattle from the Sevilleta in 1973, the reintroductions of Gunnison’s prairie dogs in 2005 and 2008 provides an interesting opportunity to study how a native keystone herbivore affects a grassland habitat without the pressures and competition from livestock."

These quads are numbered in a zig zag pattern starting in the NE corner of the plot where the first six quads go north to south, the next six plots that are west of the first quads go south to north, and so on for the remaining quads on the plot. These quads are marked by a numbered rebar stake.Field/laboratory ProceduresA 50 x 50 cm quadrat separated into twenty-five 10 x 10 cm squares are placed southeast of a small white pvc pipe that marks permanent subplots. Then, percent covers and highest height are estimated for each plant species into palmtop computers. Species occupying less than 1%, a quarter of a 10 x 10 cm square, are recorded 0.1 %. When estimating plant species percent covers yellow and green plant material are included in the measurement. Individual plants that are completely gray, containing no yellow or green foliage, are not assessed in the percent cover estimate. For highest height, the ‘average’ height of the foliage for perennialspecies is recorded and for annual plant species the height to the top of the inflorescence, flowers and fruits,is recorded. The estimate of percent cover of disturbance from prairie dogs is the same as the plant cover estimates. Finally, all prairie dog fecal pellets that are in the quadrat, subplot, are counted."

These quads are numbered in a zig zag pattern starting in the NE corner of the plot where the first six quads go north to south, the next six plots that are west of the first quads go south to north, and so on for the remaining quads on the plot. These quads are marked by a numbered rebar stake.Field/laboratory ProceduresA 50 x 50 cm quadrat separated into twenty-five 10 x 10 cm squares are placed southeast of a small white pvc pipe that marks permanent subplots. Then, percent covers and highest height are estimated for each plant species into palmtop computers. Species occupying less than 1%, a quarter of a 10 x 10 cm square, are recorded 0.1 %. When estimating plant species percent covers yellow and green plant material are included in the measurement. Individual plants that are completely gray, containing no yellow or green foliage, are not assessed in the percent cover estimate. For highest height, the ‘average’ height of the foliage for perennialspecies is recorded and for annual plant species the height to the top of the inflorescence, flowers and fruits,is recorded. The estimate of percent cover of disturbance from prairie dogs is the same as the plant cover estimates. Finally, all prairie dog fecal pellets that are in the quadrat, subplot, are counted."

00051-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This data set is a hill shade, of the 1:250000 scale Digital Elevation Model of Arizona. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology adopted by the USGS to describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital raster form. The standard DEM consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a designated coordinate projection system. The DEM data are stored as a series of profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each profile is in regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of data is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A-record), followed by a series of profile records (B-records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). A 30-minute DEM (2- by 2-arc second data spacing) consists of four 15-by 15-minute DEM blocks. Two 30-minute DEM's provide the same coverage as a standard USGS 30- by 60-minute quadrangle. Saleable units are 30- by 30-minute blocks, that is, four 15- by 15-minute DEM's representing one half of a 1:100,000-scale map."

00052-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"2008"
00052-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Phenology is the seasonal timing of environment-mediated events such as growth and reproduction. Phenology is quantified by determining time of onset and end of events, duration, and number of flowers (Augspurger 1983, Rathcke and Lacey 1985). Studies of flowering and leafing phenology have dramatically increased during the last few decades due to growing concerns over global climate change and because phenology is a highly sensitive indicator that researchers can use to study the effects of climate change at multiple scales (Chuine et al. 2000, Sparks and Menzel 2002, Peuelas et al. 2004, Williams and Abberton 2004). Urban climatic conditions are considered similar to the changing global climate conditions; therefore, many researchers study urbanized areas as smaller scale experiments, or models, of global climate change (Ziska et al. 2003). Concerns over climate change are not the only reasons for studying urban ecosystems. It is important to create urban environments resilient to social, economic, and ecological collapse. The literature of flowering phenology in urban environments suggests that spring-blooming plants in urban environments located in temperate, Mediterranean, and boreal ecosystems in North America, Europe, and China tend to bloom earlier in the city than in the surrounding un-urbanized habitat (Roetzer et al. 2000, Fitter and Fitter 2002, White et al. 2002, Ziska et al. 2003, Zhang et al. 2004). Moreover, non-woody plants, early spring bloomers, and insect-pollinated plants in these environments tend to be more sensitive than woody plants, mid- or late-spring bloomers, and wind-pollinated plants (Fitter and Fitter 2002, Traidl-Hoffman et al. 2003). Finally, temperature (Heat Island Effect) has been assumed to be the cause of earlier flowering in the urban environments since the large-scale advancement of flowering has been strongly correlated with global warming. Study of flowering phenology in urban ecosystems is important because changes in phenology may have wide-reaching consequences. Explicit study of the potential consequences of any changes in flowering phenology in urbanized areas has not been widely addressed; however, general ecological consequences from phenological changes due to global climate change have been hypothesized and studied, such as earlier and extended pollen allergy season (e.g., Van Vliet et al. 2002, Traidl-Hoffman et al. 2003, Ziska et al. 2003) and mis-matches in synchronized inter-specific interactions (e.g., Kudo et al. 2004). These effects of global climate change may be similar to changes and consequences in urban ecosystems. Other potential consequences include effects on: individual fitness (e.g. offspring production and viability); intra-specific interactions (e.g., genetic mixing); plant inter-specific interactions (e.g., resource competition); non-plant inter-specific interactions (e.g., pests, pollinators, pathogens, herbivores); economics (e.g., any agriculture occurring near or within cities, including the floral industry and crops that require pollination by native organisms; also, private gardens); and human health (e.g., pollinosis, psychological well-being/appeal)."

00052-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"sampling design Three land cover types were chosen: desert fringe, desert remnant, and mesiscaped urban. The desert fringe sites were typical creosote-dominated Sonoran desert community found in desert parks on the outskirts of the urbanized areas. Other plants in the community include mesquite shrubs, palo verde shrubs, cactus, herbaceous perennials, annuals, and brittlebush. The desert remnant sites had the same plant community structure of the desert fringe sites, but were located in large desert parks (> 5 km2) within the urban matrix. The mesiscaped urban sites were dominated by buildings providing shade, nearby impervious surfaces, trees, and grass and herbaceous cover. Three sites for each land cover type were chosen as replicates, for a total of nine sites. Sites were chosen randomly, but were limited by the ability to obtain permits, where vandalism was a low risk, and where a water source was available. The three desert fringe sites were located in parks near the Phoenix metropolitan area (Usery 46 Park, White Tanks, and Estrella Park). The three desert remnant sites were located in desert parks within the Phoenix metropolitan area (South Mountain Park, Desert Botanical Garden, and behind the Community Services Building, Arizona State University). The three mesiscaped urban sites were located within three school yards in the Phoenix metropolitan area (Meyer Elementary, Excelencia Elementary, and, Arizona State University-Tempe). Within each site, 60 genetically different potted (5 gallon) plants were placed on the ground within a fenced area. The 9-12 month old plants, 43.6 ± 11.2 cm in height (mean ± SD), were purchased from a local wholesale nursery and placed at the sites in the fall of 2006. There were holes in the bottom of the pots that allowed the roots to grow into the ground. Due to the intense sunlight in the Sonoran desert, each pot was covered with Reflectix® insulating material, reflecting 97% of radiant heat. The soil in the pots contained a slow release fertilizer (Osmocote®). Water was delivered individually to each plant through polyvinyl tubing, controlled by timers. All the plants received water on an optimal schedule (4 times/week at 20 minutes 1 time/day) until the water treatments were initiated the last week of November 2006. One third of the plants (20) at each site were exposed to a low watering schedule (1 day/week), another third to a medium water treatment (2 days/week), and the rest (20) remained on the high water treatment (4 days/week). The plants received about 1.3 L per 20 minutes of watering, with some variation depending on local water pressure. In addition, the plants received ambient water from precipitation. Drip irrigation and sprinklers were turned off where the pots were located in the mesiscaped urban sites for 47 the duration of the experiment. The water schedule was increased in early February, to compensate for lack of ambient water, but the differentiation between the treatments remained the same. Thus, across all land cover types, the plants received the exact same amount of water and had nearly similar soil conditions. sampling Beginning 14 February 2007 and ending 16 May 2007, all sites were visited once per week on the same day, for a total of 14 weeks. Presence or absence of flowers was recorded for each plant at each site. No data was collected during week 3; however, presence of flowers the previous week was interpolated based on whether or not dried flowers were present. More frequent visits and counts of the number of flowers on each plant were not done due to time constraints. Data collection ended in May because this was when the water treatments ended and when the plants began to die because of the summer heat. Pots do not buffer temperature to protect plant roots as well as plants in the ground. Time to first flower, length of flowering, and percentage of plants flowering were calculated based on the presence/absence data collected each week from each plant. Pan-trapping was used to collect potential pollinators from each site. Despite pan-trapping being considered inferior to netting and because of bias and underestimating abundance and richness (Cane et al. 2000), it enabled collection over a long period of time at many sites and prevented bias in individually netting 60 plants about 2 feet from each other. It was also used in a previous bee pollinator study conducted in the Phoenix metropolitan area (McIntyre and Hostetler 2001). Pan-trapping, even with one color, is sufficient to capture richness and abundance of bees (Stephen and Rao 2005, Toler et al. 48 2005), albeit these studies did not address non-bee pollinators. Beginning 23 March 2007 and ending 16 May 2007, all sites were visited twice per week on the same days, for a total of 9 weeks. On the first visit of each week, three plastic, 8-oz, yellow bowls were set out on the ground, in full sun, at semi-random spots at each site. Yellow bowls were chosen because brittlebush flowers are yellow. The bowls were filled to the brim with soapy tap water (3 ml unscented Ivory soap per gallon of water) and left out for 48 hours. The bowls were left out for 48 hours to allow a long enough period of time to collect pollinators throughout the day, especially early morning, but not long enough to allow all of the water to evaporate. All bowls were set out between 7 a.m. and 2 p.m. On the second visit of each week, the contents of each bowl were collected into one glass jar per site in the same order as put out and within the same time frame. The same day the potential pollinators were collected, the soapy water was filtered and the arthropods were stored in 70% ethanol for later identification. Data collection ended in May when the phenology observations ended."

Instrument locations were first geocoded using the station descriptions from each network. Daily measurements were then aggregated to bi-weekly periods (maxium of all maxima and minimum of all minima during each period) to match the temporal resolution of MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites designed for global monitoring of key biophysical parameters including vegetation. Tables with aggregated temperature were then joined to the shapefile of meteorological stations. Spatial interpolation Temperature was gridded in two steps. First, I converted actual observations into hypothetical air temperature near land surface at 0 m above sea level (ASL) by applying a 6.5 K/km environmental lapse rate, which is the international standard set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Second, I used Geostatistical Analyst, the ArcGIS 9.1 extensio and performed ordinary kriging to produce a horizontal temperature distribution at 0 ASL. Standard Error maps were also produced along with temperature surfaces that were all rasterized to a 250 meter resolution grid. Final grids were created by using a digital elevation model (DEM) resampled to 250 meters and inverting the environmental lapse rate to the previously interpolated temperature surface. Temporal aggregations Biweekly temperature surfaces were aggregated to monthly time step (again maxium of the corresponding two maxima and minimum of the two minima). For each month I computed the average 6-year temperature.

00055-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"BioCON (Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen) is an ecological experiment started in 1997 at the University of Minnesota's Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve. BioCON's goal is to explore the ways in which plant communities will respond to three environmental changes that are known to be occurring on a global scale: increasing nitrogen deposition, increasing atmospheric CO2, and decreasing biodiversity. Why Biodiversity, CO2, and Nitrogen? While there are many uncertainties in global change biology, there are also some well documented facts. Some of these are: 1. The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising. Since the industrial revolution, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased from approximately 275 parts per million (ppm) to about 378 ppm today. This has been largely the result of fossil fuel burning. It is expected that CO2 levels will continue to rise, and that by the year 2050 these levels will be approximately 550 ppm. CO2 is the raw material for photosynthesis and is known to affect plant growth and development. 2. The amount of nitrogen moving through terrestrial ecosystems has increased in the recent past. While natural 'background' levels of nitrogen fixation have remained constant, human additions to the system through fertilizer production and fossil fuel use have increased dramatically. Nitrogen is a key nutrient for plant growth and plays a critical role in plant community structure and composition in many environments. 3. Biodiversity levels are falling. While the research and data are not as complete as they are for CO2 and nitrogen, data indicate that the number of species globally, is being reduced. Perhaps more important for ecosystem function, diversity levels on local to regional scales have fallen due to land use change, biotic invasion and many other drivers. While much is known about how each of these factors affects ecosystem functioning, many questions remain. There is also little data on how these issues affect each other, and what emergent qualities may arise when systems are exposed to these changes simultaneously. BioCON seeks to address these issues with this multi-year study at Cedar Creek Ecosytem Science Preserve."

00055-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"FACE TechnologyBioCON uses a unique Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) technology to elevate the atmospheric concentration of CO2 in the experimental plots. The FACE system used in the BioCON experiment was developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory. It uses natural wind conditions to carry CO2 enriched air across the vegetation. Because the plants are outside in a more natural environment, the chamber effects normally created by enclosures such as greenhouses are reduced or eliminated.WeedingWeeds were placed in paper bags labeled with the plot number and date. Sometimes we sorted the weeds into categories; sixteen species weeds - weeds that were in the experiment but were not in the plot, and real weeds - weeds that were not in the experiment and found in the plot. All of the species that were not supposed to be in the plot were pulled. Weeding tools were used to try to get out all of the roots of each plant without damaging other plants surrounding it. The weeds were then put into one of the bags identified above and all of the bags were combined and placed into a main or 'big' bag. If soil was disturbed during the process of extracting plants, we made sure to smooth it out afterwards. All weeds were dried and weighed.BurningWe burned BioCON approximately every other spring. First we burned a ring from one side to another. Then we went through the ring and spot burned the areas that did not burn well during the first burn. We followed this procedure for each ring.FertilizerWe used 4 g NH4NO3/ M2/year and 0.474g 15NH415NO3 /plot/year. First, we filled a small tin full of soil (approximately 100g) and put it in a bucket. We did this 31 times for ring one. Each ring will have a varying number of tins full of soil based on the number of plots in that ring that are receiving the nitrogen application. We then added 3.28g 15NH415NO3 in the ring one bucket (each ring will have a different amount depending on the number of N addition plots in that ring). If the ring has 30 plots to receive the application 3.17g of 15NH415NO3 were added. If the ring has 32 plots to receive the application 3.39 g of 15 NH415NO3 were added. We mixed up the contents in the bucket and then placed a tin full of soil in each 2lb paper bag labeled with the plots for ring one. We then placed 15.69g of NH4NO3 in each paper bag and mixed the soil with the15N and the NH4NO3 as much as possible. We then repeated this with the appropriate number of tins of soil per bucket and appropriate amounts of 15N for each subsequent ring. When applying the fertilizer, we mentally created four equal squares in the plot and tried to place equal amounts of fertilizer in each of the four squares."

00056-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data Policies Objectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed.

00057-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The purpose of this work is to describe determinants and spatial patterns of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in Phoenix, Arizona. Specifically, we use geographic information systems (GIS) and regression-based analyses to identify the human and biological factors that contribute to spatial and temporal variations in near-surface atmospheric CO2 levels. We use these factors to create estimated surfaces of CO2 for the urban area. We validate our surfaces using independently collected records of CO2 from several monitoring stations and transects. To investigate the temporal patterns and variations of CO2, we were able to generate CO2 surfaces for the early mornings and the afternoons, and on weekdays when traffic is heavy and spatially focused and on weekends when it is lighter and more spatially dispersed. Our findings suggest there is a distinct relationship between the structure of Phoenix CO2 levels and spatial patterns of human activities and vegetation densities. Morning CO2 levels are higher than afternoon levels and correspond closely to the density of traffic, population, and employment. The spatial structure of human activity explains the pattern of CO2 better on weekdays than on weekends. CO2 surfaces reflect declining densities of human activity with distance from the city center, the pattern of irrigated agriculture in the Phoenix area, and riparian habitats on the urban fringe. Spatial and temporal patterns of CO2 are useful in understanding urban climate and ecosystem processes"

00057-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data collection As part of the larger NSF project to study the characteristics of the CO2 dome in Phoenix, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 were measured with an InFrared gas analyzer (model LI-800; Li-Cor, Lincoln NE) along four transects on major roadways through metropolitan Phoenix on 10 14 consecutive days from 3 to 16 January, 2000. Transects 1 and 2 were chosen to bisect the urban area, north to south and east to west respectively. Transects 3 and 4 weave in and out of the urbanized area to capture CO2 processesat the urban/rural boundaries. Measurements were taken simultaneously along all four transects at 2 meters above the ground at points approximately one mile apart between the pre-dawn hours of 5:00 and 6:00 and again during the afternoon hours of 14:00 to 15:00. Idso et al. (in press) provides a more complete discussion of data collection methods. Inconsistent and erratic readings along Transect 4 led us to drop those observations from our analysis; thus we were left with morning and afternoon CO2 readings from 227 monitoring sites spread non-randomly, but covering a broad cross-section of environments, across the metropolitan area. For each site, we calculated morning and afternoon means across the 14 days (n = 14), and then on weekdays (n = 10) and weekends (n = 4) separately. Ideally, our monitoring sites would be randomly distributed across the metropolitan area. This, however, was operationally impossible given that CO2 needed to be collected at roughly the same time across all 227 sites. All sites along a given transect could be taken within an hour, and each transect was monitored simultaneously. Therefore, we assume there was a roadway effect on all transects (Idso 1998b), which we tested during our validation experiment. We separated weekday and weekend observations because intra-urban vehicular traffic is a major source of CO2 emissions and because the intensity and spatial organization of weekend and weekday traffic differs. The sheer amount of traffic along Phoenix-area thoroughfares is more than 40 percent higher on weekdays than on weekends, with Friday as the peak and Sunday as the low point. Moreover, because weekday travel is more work-oriented than weekend travel, it is more geographically concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon hours (Barber 1986). Weekend travel is less concentrated in both time and space. In a related paper characterizing urban CO2 in Phoenix, Idso et al. (in press) found that weekday CO2 levels exceed weekend levels by 30 percent in the commercial core of Phoenix but there are no weekday-weekend differences in surrounding residential areas. Independent variables for this study are population density (POP), employment density (EMP), average weekly traffic (AWT), and vegetation density (VEG). Population data were extracted from ESRI’s 1990 compiled Census data, which are based on the 1990 Census of Population (ESRI 1997). From this CD, we extracted total population for 1997 for all Census tracts in Maricopa County, Arizona. Data were converted from an ArcView© shapefile into an Arc/INFO© coverage. Employment and traffic data were obtained from the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG). Employment data were converted from tabular form to an Arc/INFO point coverage with the total number of employees associated with each point. Average weekly traffic data were converted from MAG’s 1998 average weekly traffic map into an Arc/INFO coverage. Vegetation data were provided by the Central Arizona Phoenix - Long Term Ecological Research (CAP - LTER) project as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is an indicator, with a range from 0 to 1, representing vegetation density (green leaf area, biomass, percent green cover, productivity, and photosynthetic activity). The Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) is often used as a measure of vegetation in a desert/urban environment to eliminate soil-induced variations in the index (Heute 1988). Since we wanted to account for differences in soil, we elected to use NDVI. Preliminary results of our analysis showed there were only minor differences between using NDVI and SAVI in our model. The NDVI were calculated in ERDAS© from a May 1998 Thematic Mapper image (cell resolution is approximately 30 meters). The ERDAS image was geographically referenced and converted into an Arc/INFO GRID format. The month of May was selected because the general consensus among the CAP - LTER scientists was that May coincided with maximum leafout and vegetation cover. May is also one of the best times of year for collection of remotely sensed data in this region because cloud cover tends to be minimal (the winter storms are gone, and the monsoon has not yet started). We do not view the differences between May and January as significant, because there is a strong spatial correlation in vegetation patterns from month to month. Estimating a CO2 Regression Model We first produced estimates of population, employment, traffic, and vegetation densities in a GIS by calculating the value of each independent variable surrounding each CO2 monitoring site. Lacking a generally accepted buffer size, we calculated buffers at 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1613 meters (one mile). Preliminary results of our regression model indicated that the larger buffers produced slightly stronger correlations between the independent variables and CO2 levels, but the differences were fairly small. We settled on a one-half mile buffer (807 meters) as a compromise. It is small enough to provide spatially detailed estimates of CO2 levels but large enough to produce strong relationships between the independent variables and CO2 levels. To calculate the population value (POP) for each monitoring site, we summed the total population within the buffer based on a percent area of the Census tract (Eq.1). Percent area was used because the buffer size was usually smaller in size than the underlying Census tracts. In these situations, we assumed that population was evenly distributed across the Census tract, and therefore population was estimated by multiplying the total population in the Census tract by the percent area of the buffer. POP = SUM (Ab/At * Pi) where: Ab = area of the census tract i that fell within the buffer At = total area of census tract i Pi= total population of census tract i n = total number of census tracts that intersect buffer Average weekly traffic for each CO2 monitoring site (AWT) was calculated by a percent distance of roads within the buffer, a method similar to the population value (Eq. 2). We extracted the roads that fell within the buffer and calculated the percent of the road length that fell within the buffer. The percent length was multiplied by the average weekly traffic for each road, and the total was summed. AWT = SUM(Db/Dt * Ti) where: Db = distance of road i that fell within the buffer Dt = total distance of road i Ti= total average weekly traffic on road i n = total number of roads that intersect buffer The employment value (EMP) for each CO2 monitoring site was determined by extracting all the employment points that fell within the buffer and summing the number of employees associated with these points (Eq. 3) EMP = SUM(Ei) where: Ei = the number of employees at point i n = total number of employee points that fell within the buffer The vegetation value (VEG) for each monitoring site was calculated in two steps. We first converted the grid cells into points with the NDVI value associated with each point. The points that fell within an 807-meter buffer around the monitoring site were extracted and the vegetation index for all points was summed (Eq. 4). VEG = SUM(NDVIi) where: NDVIi = the NDVI value at point i n = total number of NDVI grid points that fell within the buffer Correlation among the indicators of human activity, POP, EMP, and AWT, are moderate to high, ranging from a correlation coefficient (r) of .72 between POP and AWT to .48 between EMP and AWT. Density of all three variables is highest in the city center, but employment is more heavily concentrated there than either population or vehicular traffic. Concern about multicollinearity led us to subject the four independent variables to principal components analysis. The principal components analysis yielded two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 that together accounted for over 80 percent of the spatial variation in the four independent variables. With factor loadings of .90 for AWT, .90 for POP, and .68 for EMP, Factor 1 represents an Urbanization Factor reflecting the intensity of human activity including the presence of jobs, residents, and traffic at any given location. Highest values are in the core of the metropolitan area, and they decline outward. Factor 2, a Vegetation Factor, shows more of the vegetation cover with a loading of .97 for the NDVI. Factor scores for Factor 2 are low in the highly developed Central Business District, but high in a variety of places, including irrigated agricultural fields and the riparian habitat of the Gila River on the outskirts of the metropolitan area, and well established residential neighborhoods built on irrigated citrus groves. Both sets of component scores revealed a statistically significant deviation from normality. Both had positive skewness and positive kurtosis. As a result, both were normalized with a square root transformation. Normalized scores for the urbanization and vegetation factors were then used as independent variables in a regression equation with atmospheric CO2 concentration as the dependent variable. CO2 = a + b1 Urbanization + b2 Vegetation (5) Separate regressions were run for mornings and afternoons and for weekday and weekend averages to determine the relative importance of human activity and vegetation at the different times of the day and week and to obtain the best possible predictions of CO2 levels. Creating CO2 Surfaces The usual strategy to display estimated spatial patterns of air pollution in the form of a contoured surface is to use simple interpolation methods to estimate levels between observation units that are small in number and highly dispersed in distribution. Regression-based mapping has improved the traditional interpolation methods by allowing independent variables to predict the concentration of the pollutants rather than estimate levels simply on the basis of nearby points. Briggs et al. (1997) demonstrated this technique with air pollution, and Blennow and Persson (1998) used a similar method for examining frost variations. Briggs et al. (1997) used least squares regression to evaluate relationships between monitored levels of NO2 and exogenous variables, including traffic volume, road type, and land use/land cover in the vicinity of monitoring sites. Model coefficients are then used in a GIS to produce highly detailed NO2 surfaces that reflect the complex nature of spatial variation in urban air pollution. We created CO2 surfaces by calculating estimated CO2 values from maps of the four independent variables across the entire urbanized region. The urbanized region was covered by one-half mile grid squares (each approximately 2,035,571 square meters) corresponding closely to the one-half mile buffer distances we created around our 277 data observation units. A value for AWT, EMP, POP, and NDVI was produced for each of the 5,167 squares. Factor score coefficients were applied to these raw values to produce scores for Factor 1 (urbanization) and Factor 2 (vegetation). Factor scores were then normalized and used as independent variables with the regression coefficients to generate predicted CO2 values for each grid square, where a map of estimated CO2 surface can be created. Separate surfaces were produced for mornings and afternoons and on weekdays and weekends producing six maps: (1) average morning, (2) average afternoon, (3) weekday morning, (4) weekend morning, (5) weekday afternoon, and (6) weekend afternoon. CO2 Model Validation Validation of the predicted CO2 concentrations was carried out in two ways. First, we compared the CO2 predictions to actual CO2 levels measured at four independent sites. Two sites were located within areas of highly concentrated CO2 and two outside, with each site representing either non-managed desert landscape or managed irrigated land. The problem with these sites is, unlike the 227 transects points, they are between 180 and 600 meters from major roads and thus farther from the major source of CO2 emissions. In a second and related test, we evaluated the effects of collecting the CO2 data along major urban roadways. To test for the roadway effect on our CO2 levels, we selected six sites along major roadways and included highly vegetated, desert, and urban-residential sites with each land cover type inside and outside the areas of high CO2 concentration. CO2, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction data were collected during the pre-dawn hours and afternoon hours. Data were collected on weekdays rather than weekends because we know that traffic patterns are more concentrated on weekdays. To determine the distance decay effects, data were collected adjacent to the roadway, and at 10, 20, 40, 100, and 400-meter intervals along transects that ran perpendicular to the roadway"

00057-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data collection As part of the larger NSF project to study the characteristics of the CO2 dome in Phoenix, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 were measured with an InFrared gas analyzer (model LI-800; Li-Cor, Lincoln NE) along four transects on major roadways through metropolitan Phoenix on 10 14 consecutive days from 3 to 16 January, 2000. Transects 1 and 2 were chosen to bisect the urban area, north to south and east to west respectively. Transects 3 and 4 weave in and out of the urbanized area to capture CO2 processesat the urban/rural boundaries. Measurements were taken simultaneously along all four transects at 2 meters above the ground at points approximately one mile apart between the pre-dawn hours of 5:00 and 6:00 and again during the afternoon hours of 14:00 to 15:00. Idso et al. (in press) provides a more complete discussion of data collection methods. Inconsistent and erratic readings along Transect 4 led us to drop those observations from our analysis; thus we were left with morning and afternoon CO2 readings from 227 monitoring sites spread non-randomly, but covering a broad cross-section of environments, across the metropolitan area. For each site, we calculated morning and afternoon means across the 14 days (n = 14), and then on weekdays (n = 10) and weekends (n = 4) separately. Ideally, our monitoring sites would be randomly distributed across the metropolitan area. This, however, was operationally impossible given that CO2 needed to be collected at roughly the same time across all 227 sites. All sites along a given transect could be taken within an hour, and each transect was monitored simultaneously. Therefore, we assume there was a roadway effect on all transects (Idso 1998b), which we tested during our validation experiment. We separated weekday and weekend observations because intra-urban vehicular traffic is a major source of CO2 emissions and because the intensity and spatial organization of weekend and weekday traffic differs. The sheer amount of traffic along Phoenix-area thoroughfares is more than 40 percent higher on weekdays than on weekends, with Friday as the peak and Sunday as the low point. Moreover, because weekday travel is more work-oriented than weekend travel, it is more geographically concentrated in the early morning and late afternoon hours (Barber 1986). Weekend travel is less concentrated in both time and space. In a related paper characterizing urban CO2 in Phoenix, Idso et al. (in press) found that weekday CO2 levels exceed weekend levels by 30 percent in the commercial core of Phoenix but there are no weekday-weekend differences in surrounding residential areas. Independent variables for this study are population density (POP), employment density (EMP), average weekly traffic (AWT), and vegetation density (VEG). Population data were extracted from ESRI’s 1990 compiled Census data, which are based on the 1990 Census of Population (ESRI 1997). From this CD, we extracted total population for 1997 for all Census tracts in Maricopa County, Arizona. Data were converted from an ArcView© shapefile into an Arc/INFO© coverage. Employment and traffic data were obtained from the Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG). Employment data were converted from tabular form to an Arc/INFO point coverage with the total number of employees associated with each point. Average weekly traffic data were converted from MAG’s 1998 average weekly traffic map into an Arc/INFO coverage. Vegetation data were provided by the Central Arizona Phoenix - Long Term Ecological Research (CAP - LTER) project as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is an indicator, with a range from 0 to 1, representing vegetation density (green leaf area, biomass, percent green cover, productivity, and photosynthetic activity). The Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) is often used as a measure of vegetation in a desert/urban environment to eliminate soil-induced variations in the index (Heute 1988). Since we wanted to account for differences in soil, we elected to use NDVI. Preliminary results of our analysis showed there were only minor differences between using NDVI and SAVI in our model. The NDVI were calculated in ERDAS© from a May 1998 Thematic Mapper image (cell resolution is approximately 30 meters). The ERDAS image was geographically referenced and converted into an Arc/INFO GRID format. The month of May was selected because the general consensus among the CAP - LTER scientists was that May coincided with maximum leafout and vegetation cover. May is also one of the best times of year for collection of remotely sensed data in this region because cloud cover tends to be minimal (the winter storms are gone, and the monsoon has not yet started). We do not view the differences between May and January as significant, because there is a strong spatial correlation in vegetation patterns from month to month. Estimating a CO2 Regression Model We first produced estimates of population, employment, traffic, and vegetation densities in a GIS by calculating the value of each independent variable surrounding each CO2 monitoring site. Lacking a generally accepted buffer size, we calculated buffers at 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1613 meters (one mile). Preliminary results of our regression model indicated that the larger buffers produced slightly stronger correlations between the independent variables and CO2 levels, but the differences were fairly small. We settled on a one-half mile buffer (807 meters) as a compromise. It is small enough to provide spatially detailed estimates of CO2 levels but large enough to produce strong relationships between the independent variables and CO2 levels. To calculate the population value (POP) for each monitoring site, we summed the total population within the buffer based on a percent area of the Census tract (Eq.1). Percent area was used because the buffer size was usually smaller in size than the underlying Census tracts. In these situations, we assumed that population was evenly distributed across the Census tract, and therefore population was estimated by multiplying the total population in the Census tract by the percent area of the buffer. POP = SUM (Ab/At * Pi) where: Ab = area of the census tract i that fell within the buffer At = total area of census tract i Pi= total population of census tract i n = total number of census tracts that intersect buffer Average weekly traffic for each CO2 monitoring site (AWT) was calculated by a percent distance of roads within the buffer, a method similar to the population value (Eq. 2). We extracted the roads that fell within the buffer and calculated the percent of the road length that fell within the buffer. The percent length was multiplied by the average weekly traffic for each road, and the total was summed. AWT = SUM(Db/Dt * Ti) where: Db = distance of road i that fell within the buffer Dt = total distance of road i Ti= total average weekly traffic on road i n = total number of roads that intersect buffer The employment value (EMP) for each CO2 monitoring site was determined by extracting all the employment points that fell within the buffer and summing the number of employees associated with these points (Eq. 3) EMP = SUM(Ei) where: Ei = the number of employees at point i n = total number of employee points that fell within the buffer The vegetation value (VEG) for each monitoring site was calculated in two steps. We first converted the grid cells into points with the NDVI value associated with each point. The points that fell within an 807-meter buffer around the monitoring site were extracted and the vegetation index for all points was summed (Eq. 4). VEG = SUM(NDVIi) where: NDVIi = the NDVI value at point i n = total number of NDVI grid points that fell within the buffer Correlation among the indicators of human activity, POP, EMP, and AWT, are moderate to high, ranging from a correlation coefficient (r) of .72 between POP and AWT to .48 between EMP and AWT. Density of all three variables is highest in the city center, but employment is more heavily concentrated there than either population or vehicular traffic. Concern about multicollinearity led us to subject the four independent variables to principal components analysis. The principal components analysis yielded two factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0 that together accounted for over 80 percent of the spatial variation in the four independent variables. With factor loadings of .90 for AWT, .90 for POP, and .68 for EMP, Factor 1 represents an Urbanization Factor reflecting the intensity of human activity including the presence of jobs, residents, and traffic at any given location. Highest values are in the core of the metropolitan area, and they decline outward. Factor 2, a Vegetation Factor, shows more of the vegetation cover with a loading of .97 for the NDVI. Factor scores for Factor 2 are low in the highly developed Central Business District, but high in a variety of places, including irrigated agricultural fields and the riparian habitat of the Gila River on the outskirts of the metropolitan area, and well established residential neighborhoods built on irrigated citrus groves. Both sets of component scores revealed a statistically significant deviation from normality. Both had positive skewness and positive kurtosis. As a result, both were normalized with a square root transformation. Normalized scores for the urbanization and vegetation factors were then used as independent variables in a regression equation with atmospheric CO2 concentration as the dependent variable. CO2 = a + b1 Urbanization + b2 Vegetation (5) Separate regressions were run for mornings and afternoons and for weekday and weekend averages to determine the relative importance of human activity and vegetation at the different times of the day and week and to obtain the best possible predictions of CO2 levels. Creating CO2 Surfaces The usual strategy to display estimated spatial patterns of air pollution in the form of a contoured surface is to use simple interpolation methods to estimate levels between observation units that are small in number and highly dispersed in distribution. Regression-based mapping has improved the traditional interpolation methods by allowing independent variables to predict the concentration of the pollutants rather than estimate levels simply on the basis of nearby points. Briggs et al. (1997) demonstrated this technique with air pollution, and Blennow and Persson (1998) used a similar method for examining frost variations. Briggs et al. (1997) used least squares regression to evaluate relationships between monitored levels of NO2 and exogenous variables, including traffic volume, road type, and land use/land cover in the vicinity of monitoring sites. Model coefficients are then used in a GIS to produce highly detailed NO2 surfaces that reflect the complex nature of spatial variation in urban air pollution.

00058-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Meteorological data acquisition and preprocessing Temperature data were obtained from different sources including the Flood Control Disctrict of Maricopa County (ALERT), the National Weather Service (NWS), the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET), and the Phoenix Real-time Instrumentation for Surface Meteorological Studies (PRISMS) Network. Instrument locations were first geocoded using the station descriptions from each network. Daily measurements were then aggregated to bi-weekly periods (maxium of all maxima and minimum of all minima during each period) to match the temporal resolution of MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites designed for global monitoring of key biophysical parameters including vegetation. Tables with aggregated temperature were then joined to the shapefile of meteorological stations. Spatial interpolation Temperature was gridded in two steps. First, I converted actual observations into hypothetical air temperature near land surface at 0 m above sea level (ASL) by applying a 6.5 K/km environmental lapse rate, which is the international standard set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

00058-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Meteorological data acquisition and preprocessing Temperature data were obtained from different sources including the Flood Control Disctrict of Maricopa County (ALERT), the National Weather Service (NWS), the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET), and the Phoenix Real-time Instrumentation for Surface Meteorological Studies (PRISMS) Network. Instrument locations were first geocoded using the station descriptions from each network. Daily measurements were then aggregated to bi-weekly periods (maxium of all maxima and minimum of all minima during each period) to match the temporal resolution of MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites designed for global monitoring of key biophysical parameters including vegetation. Tables with aggregated temperature were then joined to the shapefile of meteorological stations. Spatial interpolation Temperature was gridded in two steps. First, I converted actual observations into hypothetical air temperature near land surface at 0 m above sea level (ASL) by applying a 6.5 K/km environmental lapse rate, which is the international standard set forth by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Second, I used Geostatistical Analyst, the ArcGIS 9.1 extensio and performed ordinary kriging to produce a horizontal temperature distribution at 0 ASL.

00059-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"We collected monthly observations of water microbial characteristics from each of the FCE LTER sites beginning in February 2001. Bacteria counts using DAPI epifluorescence, heterotrophic bacteria production with tritiated Thymidine uptake, and algal energetics and chl a using the PAM fluorometer were determined from each of the water samples. Bacteria counts in Shark River Slough in the freshwater end of the transect revealed highest bacteria numbers upon marsh rewetting after the dry down. The highest overall count of bacteria was found at the most freshwater point adjacent to the perimeter of the water conservation area but only in March of 2001. Peak numbers of bacteria in the saline end of Shark River transect occurred in December and July. There is some evidence that these higher bacteria numbers in the SR transect are associated with higher salinities. Highest bacteria counts along the Taylor slough transect were observed at the mouth of the Taylor River with peak counts in the wet season in October. Bacteria densities also increased from the eastern to western end of the transect in Florida Bay. Heterotrophic bacterial production did not relate closely bacteria numbers and exhibited highest numbers in the dry season. There was no discernible relationship between salinity and bacteria production as seen in bacteria numbers. Monthly observations using PAM fluorometry revealed that brown algae was the greatest contribution to the algal chal a pool and this relationship was consistent across all FCE LTER sites. Converse to the pattern of bacteria abundance along the Shark River transect, there was evidence that algal biomass decreases from freshwater to estuary. In the Shark River, algal energetics increased from marsh to estuary as well as in the panhandle region of the Taylor River transect. From these observations we conclude the behavior of the microbial loop and interactions generated between functional guilds is highly variable along individual transects and between the Shark River and Taylor River transect. Wet dry season dynamics partially explain temporal variability in microbial dynamics along the individual transects yet responses were unique for each section of the transect as freshwater versus estuarine versus Bay. Relationships between salinity and microbial parameters in this case, were not easily discerned but were more consistent within the two river transects than between river transects."

Samples for microbial analyses were collected in washed, acid-rinsed, ADDIH2O rinsed, then sample rinsed brown, 250 ml, Nalgene bottles. Depth of sampling was 10 cm below the water surface. A sample for PAM analysis was set aside for a 10 hr dark acclimation period. Bacterial abundance was determined through epifluorenscence microscopy using DAPI DNA stain after preservation with 2 percent bacterial free phosphate buffered formalin and dark storage. Slides were made within 14 days of collection and counted immediately after they were prepared. Algal dynamics were determined through PAM (pulse-amplitude modulation) fluorescence within 24 hours of collection. Algal energetics samples were analyzed using PAM fluormetry for chl a content and productivity irradiance curves. Heterotrophic bacterial production was determined using tritiated thymidine uptake within 24 hours of collection. We incubated each of the duplicate samplings per site with 3 replicates and one blank of 10 ml for each sample. The blank was killed with BFF to a final concentration of 4 percent. Stock tritiated thymidine was made with 2.58 mCi radioisotope with 30 ml of filter sterilized (0.2 um) water from Shark River. Each replicate and blank received 0.86 uCi ml-1 and was incubated at 22 degrees C for one hour. We also determined the specific activity for each incubation. We stopped the incubation period with TCA to final concentration of 5 percent then put the samples on ice for 15 to 45 minutes before filtering the sample onto nitrocellulose filters.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

In this technique, a rapid series of high frequency flashes permits measurement of the absorption cross section of Photosystem II (quantum yield), the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, the level of photochemical quenching, and the concentration of chlorophyll a. At these same sites we enumerate bacteria using DAPI epifluorescent microscopy and determine bacterial productivity using 3H-thymidine uptake experiments. We compare algal:bacterial biomass and productivity as well as grazing rates in an effort to characterize the microbial loop.DOM Bioavailability Assays: We conduct biomass leaching experiments (abiotic) to characterize the DOM generated by specific sources. Results of such end-member experiments are then applied in the field. We conduct bioavailability assays on ambient and leached DOM using 16 day incubations. We quantified loss of the DOM (DOC, DON) fraction as well as the chemical characteristics. The assays are designed to quantify the effect of nutrient additions on DOM degradation and are conducted with an ambient control. Shark River Surveys: Biannual sampling events of the Shark River estuary in the Everglades were performed in March 2001 and ended October 2002. Surveys were conducted at slack low and high tide along the salinity gradient. In addition samples were collected at a central station in the river over a 48 hour period. Variables measured included temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, total organic nitrogen, soluble reactive phosphorus, total phosphorus, total organic carbon, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, turbidity, and light extinction. Algal energetics (as quantum yield) and chlorophyll a concentrations for major phytoplankton guilds (green algae, brown algae, and cyanobacteria) were quantified using a PhytoPAM fluorometer. Bacteria were quantified by direct counts using DAPI; 3H-thymidine uptake was used to measure bacterial production.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park. There are a total of 21 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle.-81.07794623-80.4897820725.7614517124.912934922000-05-012006-04-30"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

In this technique, a rapid series of high frequency flashes permits measurement of the absorption cross section of Photosystem II (quantum yield), the rate of photosynthetic electron transport, the level of photochemical quenching, and the concentration of chlorophyll a. At these same sites we enumerate bacteria using DAPI epifluorescent microscopy and determine bacterial productivity using 3H-thymidine uptake experiments. We compare algal:bacterial biomass and productivity as well as grazing rates in an effort to characterize the microbial loop.DOM Bioavailability Assays: We conduct biomass leaching experiments (abiotic) to characterize the DOM generated by specific sources. Results of such end-member experiments are then applied in the field. We conduct bioavailability assays on ambient and leached DOM using 16 day incubations. We quantified loss of the DOM (DOC, DON) fraction as well as the chemical characteristics. The assays are designed to quantify the effect of nutrient additions on DOM degradation and are conducted with an ambient control.

00061-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Shrub encroachment alters community dynamics and ecosystem functioning worldwide. Grazing increases shrub encroachment as herbivores selectively consume grasses, easing the advancement of shrubs. Diversity decreases with shrub invasion and species richness drops by half when semiarid grasslands become shrublands. A shift in dominance from grasses to shrubs changes community structure and lowers community stability by increasing species turnover. Transition to shrubland also increases regional winter low temperatures by nearly 2˚C. Soil resource distributions change in invaded grasslands as shrubs create islands of fertility and alter nutrient cycles. Soil under plants has higher infiltration rates than interspaces and at the SNWR shrublands have twice as much interspace area than grasslands, leading to higher runoff. Greater runoff also leads to greater soil and nutrient removal. Shrub encroachment in the Southwest has increased dramatically over the past 150 years and is presumably linked to intensified human impacts. One local example of shrub encroachment is the expansion of creosote (Larrea tridentata) within Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. Chihuahuan Desert grasslands stretch from central Mexico to central New Mexico and are dominated by black grama. Winter low temperatures limit northward creosote expansion. Over the past century winter low temperature have increased 2˚C within some areas of the Southwest. With nighttime temperatures predicted to continue increasing, temperature limitations of creosote distribution may be relaxed. Within central New Mexico lies the transition between Chihuahuan Desert grassland and Colorado plateau shortgrass steppe, dominated by blue grama. Although temperature and climate are similar at the boundary between these ecosystems, creosote is only found in black grama grasslands and not in blue grama grasslands. Soil texture varies between the two grasslands and has been suggested as a major factor restricting creosote expansion along the transition. However, the affect of soil texture on creosote expansion has not been directly tested. The main research questions were: i) Can creosote germinate in blue grama grasslands? ii) Does grazing influence creosote germination in semiarid grasslands?"

00061-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Creosote seeds were collected from the SNWR and planted within 3 days to prevent seeds from entering dormancy. Germination success is highly variable between creosote individuals therefore seeds were collected from 15 individual shrubs and the identity of each mother plant was maintained throughout the experiment. At grassland sites, three treatments included planting in interspaces, grass patches, and under clipped grasses to simulate grazing. There was no grass at the creosote site so seeds were only planted under shrubs and interspaces. For each replicate, 10 seeds were planted inside a seed collar with closed sides, an open bottom and screened top to prevent rodent disturbance. Control collars for each treatment were deployed without seed addition to determine background creosote germination from the seed bank. Seed collars were planted in linear transects with the treatment (interspace, grass, grazed, interspace control, grass control, grazed control) and mother plant ID (1 - 15) completely randomized along a transect. There were 5 replicate transects per site. Grassland transects contained 60 seed collars and shrubland transects contained 40 seed collars for a total of 800 seed collars. Creosote germination requires ample moisture, so for a month following planting seeds were watered weekly with a 2.5 cm rain event if no precipitation occurred. Seeds were planted on August 30th, 2010. Based on greenhouse experiments, germination was expected to occur within 10 to 14 days. Seed collars were checked for germination on a weekly basis for a month following planting. At the end of the experiment no germination had occurred."

00063-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data PoliciesObjectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed. Data Acknowledgment Policy: Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use. Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned: Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project.

We are interested in spatial and temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across scales. Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER Network, one of > 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation.U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210)"

We are interested in spatial and temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across scales. Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER Network, one of > 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation.U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210)"

00064-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Aim We analysed lake-sediment pollen records from eight sites in southern New England to address: (1) regional variation in ecological responses to post-glacial climatic changes, (2) landscape-scale vegetational heterogeneity at different times in the past, and (3) environmental and ecological controls on spatial patterns of vegetation. Location The eight study sites are located in southern New England in the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut. The sites span a climatic and vegetational gradient from the lowland areas of eastern Massachusetts and Connecticut to the uplands of north-central and western Massachusetts. Tsuga canadensis and Fagus grandifolia are abundant in the upland area, while Quercus, Carya and Pinus species have higher abundances in the lowlands. Methods We collected sediment cores from three lakes in eastern and north-central Massachusetts (Berry East, Blood and Little Royalston Ponds). Pollen records from those sites were compared with previously published pollen data from five other sites. Multivariate data analysis (non-metric multi-dimensional scaling) was used to compare the pollen spectra of these sites through time. Results Our analyses revealed a sequence of vegetational responses to climate changes occurring across southern New England during the past 14,000 calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal yr BP). Pollen assemblages at all sites were dominated by Picea and Pinus banksiana between 14,000 and 11,500 cal yr BP; by Pinus strobus from 11,500 to 10,500 cal yr BP; and by P. strobus and Tsuga between 10,500 and 9500 cal yr BP. At 9500-8000 cal yr BP, however, vegetation composition began to differentiate between lowland and upland sites. Lowland sites had higher percentages of Quercus pollen, whereas Tsuga abundance was higher at the upland sites. This spatial heterogeneity strengthened between 8000 and 5500 cal yr BP, when Fagus became abundant in the uplands and Quercus pollen percentages increased further in the lowland records. The differentiation of upland and lowland vegetation zones remained strong during the mid-Holocene Tsuga decline (5500-3500 cal yr BP), but the pattern weakened during the late-Holocene (3500-300 cal yr BP) and European-settlement intervals. Within-group similarity declined in response to the uneven late-Holocene expansion of Castanea, while between-group similarity increased due to homogenization of the regional vegetation by forest clearance and ongoing disturbances. Main conclusions The regional gradient of vegetation composition across southern New England was first established between 9500 and 8000 cal yr BP. The spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation may have arisen at that time in response to the development or strengthening of the regional climatic gradient. Alternatively, the differentiation of upland and lowland vegetation types may have occurred as the climate ameliorated and an increasing number of species arrived in the region, arranging themselves in progressively more complex vegetation patterns across relatively stationary environmental gradients. The emergence of a regional vegetational gradient in southern New England may be a manifestation of the increasing number of species and more finely divided resource gradient."

A team of researchers seeks to understand the structure and function of the Western Antarctic Peninsula's marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the context of seasonal-to-interannual atmospheric and sea ice dynamics, as well as long-term climate change. The PAL measurement system (or grid) is designed to study marine and terrestrial food webs consisting principally of diatom primary producers, the dominant herbivore Antarctic krill, and the apex predator Adelie penguin. An attenuated microbial food web is also a focus. PAL studies these ecosystems annually over a regional scale grid of oceanographic stations and seasonally at Palmer Station. Palmer Station is located on Anvers Island west of the Antarctic Peninula. The peninsula runs perpendicular to a strong climatic gradient between the cold, dry continental regime to the south, characteristic of the Antarctic interior, and the warm, moist, maritime regime to the north. North-south shifts in the gradient give rise to large environmental variability to climate change. Sea ice extent and variability affects ecosystem changes at all trophic levels. In addition to the long-term field and research activities, information management, graduate student training, education and outreach are an integral part of the program.NSF/OPP OPP-9011927 , OPP-0217282 , OPP-9632763"

A team of researchers seeks to understand the structure and function of the Western Antarctic Peninsula's marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the context of seasonal-to-interannual atmospheric and sea ice dynamics, as well as long-term climate change. The PAL measurement system (or grid) is designed to study marine and terrestrial food webs consisting principally of diatom primary producers, the dominant herbivore Antarctic krill, and the apex predator Adelie penguin. An attenuated microbial food web is also a focus. PAL studies these ecosystems annually over a regional scale grid of oceanographic stations and seasonally at Palmer Station. Palmer Station is located on Anvers Island west of the Antarctic Peninula. The peninsula runs perpendicular to a strong climatic gradient between the cold, dry continental regime to the south, characteristic of the Antarctic interior, and the warm, moist, maritime regime to the north. North-south shifts in the gradient give rise to large environmental variability to climate change. Sea ice extent and variability affects ecosystem changes at all trophic levels. In addition to the long-term field and research activities, information management, graduate student training, education and outreach are an integral part of the program.NSF/OPP OPP-9011927 , OPP-0217282 , OPP-9632763"

00066-metadata.xml,Supplemental Information,/eml:eml/dataset/additionalInfo,"Grassland: The sampling locations for the grassland habitat are located along the road between Black Butte and 5-Points. Stations are numbered as follows, from north to south: 146, 147, 140, 141 142, 143, 144 and 145. All stakes are located  on the east side of the road. As one drives south from Black Butte, Station #138 (changed to 146 in the spring of 1995 because old tag lost) is located 1.2 miles south of the road intersection immediately east of Black Butte. Stations are then located at 0.5 mile intervals. There are eight total stations.Creosote: The sampling locations for the creosote shrubland are located on or near the road that runs along the north rim of  Palo Duro Canyon (east and west of 5-points). Stakes are numbered from #130 through #137, and are located on the north side of the road. Stake locations are as follows: #130 West of 5-points at Pipeline Road; mileage = 0.0 #131 Heading east, site is on road; mileage = 0.3 #132 Heading east, site is on road; mileage = 0.6 #133 Turn south on 'Neck Road', site is on road (stake is on west side of road); mileage = 1.0 from # 130 #134 Return to main east-west read, turn east and proceed to intersection of road coming from north (the 'common garden' road). Keep going east 0.1 mile, and look for flagged stake on south side of road. Sample point is 200 meters south of road near the tall 'A-100' rebar post of the rodent trapping web. #135 At 5-points, in the center of the triangle formed by the three main roads. Flagged stake is on the east-west road, north side. Sample point is 50 meters north of road. Zero odometer here for next two stations. #136 Proceed east on road 0.3 miles from #135. Flagged stake in on north side of road, and sample point is 50 meters north of road. #137 Proceed east on road 0.7 miles from # 135. Flagged stake is on north side of road. Sample point is on road.Pinyon-Juniper: Sample locations are in Goat Draw. All sample points are off the main road, on high ground to one side or the other. Flagged stakes mark parking positions on road, and flagged, numbered stakes mark sampling points. Stations are numbered from #121 in the lower canyon to #129 in the upper canyon. There are nine total staions (eight regular stations and one station at the Goat Draw well site). Odometer is zeroed at sign-in box near entrance gate. Stake locations are as follows: #121 Mileage = 0.7 Sample location is on hill to west. #122 Mileage = 1.3 Goat Draw Well.

Sampling was done in the last two weeks of February, May, August, and December.  Year-to-year variation likely affected bird patterns relative to the schedule, but these dates generally enabled an accurate sampling of species richness and abundance. Weather permitting, each of the three habitats were surveyed over three consecutive days.  Unseasonable conditions, windy mornings (7+ mph), and rain were avoided. Bird densities were sampled using a Variable Circular Plot Census technique. There were eight sampling locations in each of the three habitat types. (However, the sampling design did not include replication, and, therefore, estimates of density should be considered tentative.)  At each sampling location the observer stood at a stake for nine minutes and scanned for bird activity. All individuals seen and/or heard within a 200 meter radius were recorded.  For each bird observation these variables were recorded: species ID (according to the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU)), estimated distance from sampling location in meters, cardinal direction, and detection mode (sight or sound). The observer also tallied individuals flying over a sample area and included these in the data. Additional birds observed while travelling between sampling locations were noted but not included in the data set.  Finally, weather conditions at the beginning and end of each daily sample were recorded. This included an estimate of wind speed (mph) and cloud cover (using an eight-point scale: 0 (clear) to 8 (completely overcast)), and a measurement of temperature."

00066-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.). Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata). Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site. Notable forb species include trailing four o’clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2 106.717 106.717 34.3381 34.3381 1615 1615 meter"

Ecological Applications. We used state-of-the-art species distribution modeling techniques to generate a map of hemlock distribution and abundance. We used nine statistical algorithms available within the BIOMOD framework in the statistical language R to relate occurrence of hemlock to 26 environmental predictor variables. Occurrence data were comprised of 16,084 points from the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database. Environment predictors included 23 bioclimatic variables describing minimum, maximum, and seasonality in temperature, precipitation and water balance, two topographic variables (slope and compound topography index) from the USGS HYDRO1k dataset, and an index of net primary productivity. All variables were manipulated in ArcGIS 9.3 such that they were spatially congruent, had a common resolution of 1 km, and were projected using an equidistance conic projection to preserve distance characteristics between locations. Within BIOMOD, the occurrence data were randomly divided into ten different calibration (70%) and evaluation (30%) datasets, models were developed and evaluated for each of the ten datasets, and the outcomes of the ten runs were averaged, thus ensuring the final evaluation was somewhat independent of a particular realization of a random split of the occurrence data. Finally, we combined the averaged model from each of the nine algorithms into a single consensus prediction using techniques from ensemble forecasting. The true skill statistic was used to inform a weighted average of individual model contribution to the ensemble. This consensus model was projected across eastern North America, including Canada where we did not have data on hemlock occurrence. The result was a continuous map of the probability of hemlock occurrence at all locations within the map. Hemlock is patchily distributed across the landscape and does not occur in every suitable location. We thus removed a portion of cells by sub-sampling the probability of occurrence map. The probability of a cell remaining in the map was equal to the predicted probability of hemlock occurring in that cell. This approach produced a realistic, heterogeneous map in which most but not all of the low probability sites were removed and where many of the high probability sites remained. To produce a map of hemlock abundance we used the randomForests algorithm in R 2.9.1 to relate observed hemlock abundance (basal area, m2 ha-1) from the FIA database to the same 26 predictor variables used to model probability of hemlock occurrence. We used the resulting model to predict hemlock abundance across eastern North America, but only in cells remaining in the sub-sampled probability of occurrence map. To account for the fact that most cells were not 100% forested, we multiplied the map of hemlock abundance by a corresponding remotely sensed estimate of percent forest cover. The result was a map of hemlock abundance adjusted for forest cover that corresponds well with its known distribution and abundance."

00069-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The belowground system in arid and semiarid regions can be of relatively greater importance than in more mesic systems because plant competition is most often for soil water rather than for light in aboveground canopies. Belowground plant biomass in the shortgrass steppe represents approximately 80% of the total. These data, entitled Long-Term Seasonal Root Biomass, were obtained in section 21 of the Central Plains Experimental Range from 1985-2008 in conjunction with a 14C labeling experiment designed to test isotope methods of estimating root production. Paired plots for each of eight replicate 14C labeled plots were established and cored on average six times per year over 13 years (five cores each plot each date as above). There were two primary objectives for collecting these data, 1) to compare estimates of root production (or belowground net primary production - BNPP) obtained using the sequential coring of biomass methods with various isotope, minirhizotron, ingrowth, and other methods, and 2) to examine long-term controls on the temporal dynamics of root biomass. This shortgrass steppe LTER site is the only place we are aware of that has compared most methods of estimating BNPP, including sequential coring, ingrowth cores, and ingrowth donuts, 14C pulse-isotope dilution, 14C pulse-isotope turnover, rhizotron windows, and minirhizotron, and indirect methods including nitrogen budget, carbon flux, simulation carbon flow model, and regression model. All production methods are compared in Milchunas (2009), and more detailed comparisons among particular methods can be found in Milchunas and Lauenroth (1992, 2001), and Milchunas et al. (2005a, and 2005b). Results and conclusions concerning root biomass dynamics and relationships with precipitation, season, and aboveground biomass are reported primarily in Milchunas and Lauenroth (2001). If you are interested in using these data they are downloadable from the SGS website, however we encourage you to seek advice from the researchers on the SGS project before you apply this dataset.

00069-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Methods for this dataset Study Area Location and Design: These samples are taken south of the C14 plots approximately five yards from the outside perimeter of the C14 plots. (Until 2000 they were taken to the North of the C14 plots). This sampling is performed the 15th of April – September each year. Root washing is performed at the root washing station outside the field station. Sampling Protocol: Equipment: Pin flags (40) Clippers Short Corers (20 cm) Sledge Hammers Jack with Chain and Bolt Forty Medium Sized Paper Bags (pre-labeled 1-1 through 8-5) Wheel Barrow or bucket and shovel South of C14 plots approximately 5 yards randomly place five pin flags in line with existing C14 so there are a total of 8 plots with 5 pin flags in each. At each pin flag, score the soil with a soil corer. Clip out the blue grama crowns and above ground vegetation. Leave all roots in place. Core the root sample and put it in the correct bag. Place samples in garage drying oven at 55 degrees centigrade for 3 days. Then root wash. Fill in the holes left from the core with soil from the near by soil pit. Fill the hole neatly, so the soil is level with the existing ground level. Root Washing Protocol: Equipment: metal pans with spouts, 500-micrometer sieve, larger opening sieve, water hose, and sprayers at root washing station, coin envelopes, and a sharpie. Procedure: 1. Place larger sized sieve on top of bars running across the metal pail. 2. Place 500 micrometer sieve on table beneath pail spout and place an object (tent stakes work well) beneath this sieve to allow water to run out. 3. Take a paper bag with a soil sample and copy information (i.e. study, location, data, etc.) onto a coin envelope. 4. Carefully dump soil into large sieve. 5. Take sprayer connection and gently wash soil through large sieve. While washing, place one hand in between large sieve and pail spout to prevent rocks from flowing into the 500-micrometer sieve. 6. When all the soil has been washed off, take the roots in the large sieve (while being careful not to grab any rocks) and place them in the coin envelope. 7. To collect remaining roots, carefully pour water in pail through 500-micrometer sieve (roots should float to the top and rocks and soil should sink to the bottom of the pail). Pour off water just until soil/rocks start to flow out. It works well to pour water near one side of the sieve so the roots collect in one spot. You may use the sprayer to spray roots to one edge of the sieve, but do so gently. 8. Grab roots in 500-micrometer sieve, wring out the water, and place in coin envelope. 9. Take the sprayer and agitate the soil in bottom of the pail. After allowing the soil/rocks to settle again to the bottom of the pail, pour off water and roots through the 500-micrometer sieve. Repeat this 3 times, or until it appears that all of the roots have been collected. 10. Clean any soil/rocks out of the pail and wash out any roots stuck in the sieves before processing the next sample. QAQC Instructions: It is very important that you use the correct core with the correct diameter (6.65 cm) for this sampling. Make sure that all samples have been taken before leaving the site. When root washing make sure that you are using the correct smaller size sieve (500 micrometers) and that all envelopes are labeled correctly. Be sure both soil core samples and root samples are stored in the drying oven at 55 degrees C when they not out being processed."

00070-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Meteorological data acquisition and preprocessing Precipitation data were obtained from different sources including the Flood Control Disctrict of Maricopa County (ALERT), the National Weather Service (NWS), the Arizona Meteorological Network (AZMET), and the Phoenix Real-time Instrumentation for Surface Meteorological Studies (PRISMS) Network. Instrument locations were first geocoded using the station descriptions from each network. Daily measurements were then aggregated to bi-weekly periods to match the temporal resolution of MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. MODIS is a key instrument aboard the Terra (EOS AM) and Aqua (EOS PM) satellites designed for global monitoring of key biophysical parameters including vegetation. Tables with aggregated precipitation were then joined to the shapefile of precipitaiton sensors. Spatial interpolation I performed ordinary kriging to create precipitaion surfaces. The maps were created using Geostatistical Analyst, the ArcGIS 9.1 extension. Spherical models were used in all semivariogram models and predictions were checked interactively using the built-in tools. Standard Error maps were also produced along with prediction surfaces that were all rasterized to a 250 meter resolution grid. Temporal aggregations Biweekly precipitation surfaces were aggregated to monthly time step. In turn monthly surfaces were summed up to derive annual precipitation grids. For each month I computed the average 6-year precipitaion. Finally the average annual precipitation was also computed for the period of 2000-2006.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Birds are being surveyed by both LTER researchers and by local interest groups and individuals (e.g., Maricopa Audubon Society). A new interactive bird population web site is now posted. One can obtain results for bird censuses that have been going on since 1 May 1998. Volunteers in combination with LTER birders have been censusing birds in over 70 transects located throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area. The goals of this project are (1) to document the changes in avian richness and abundance over time and space, and (2) to determine the biotic/abiotic factors and socioeconomic/political factors that cause these changes to occur. We have developed a census protocol and have started conducting bird censuses in four key habitats in the CAP LTER study area."

00072-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Bird transect sampling Using a stratified random sampling strategy, we have established thirty 1-km transects in four key habitat types within the Phoenix metro area. These habitats include older residential neighborhoods (8 sites), younger residential neighborhoods (8 sites), remnant desert areas (8 sites), and golf courses (8 sites). These sites are located in southern Phoenix, Tempe, Chandler, and Mesa. Desert transects are divided into five 200 meter segments and the other transects are divided into ten 100 meter segments to evaluate the effects of landscape structure at the patch level. Each transect is sampled by recording all birds that are seen or heard within 20 m and 40 m on both sides of the transect. Each transect is censused 3 - 4 times a year."

00073-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The purpose of this experiment is to measure how initially disturbing an area and adding nitrogen over a long time will affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. This experiment is conducted within fields (A, B, and C) which were initially low in soil nutrients. The ground was disturbed by thoroughly disking the area prior to establishment of the experiment. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June. There are six replicates of each treatment per field. The treatments were randomly assigned to plots of size 4 by 4 meters. The plots are in 6 plot by 9 plot grids with 1 meter aisles between plots. The plot grids are enclosed by a fence to keep out mammalian herbivores. Gophers are trapped and removed as they appear. In the spring of 1992, subexperiments E097 and E098 were established. E097 is in fields A and C where randomly selected plots within each treatment no longer receive fertilizer. E098 is in field B where randomly selected plots within each treatment are burned. Note that the design of E002 is similar to E001 except E002 was thoroughly disked prior to establishment."

00073-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field Operations: FertilizationFertilizer is mixed and spread by hand twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. Each plot gets the fertilizer mixture specified by its fertilizer treatment code. In the spring of 1992, 3 randomly chosen replicates of each fertilizer treatment in field A and C were chosen to receive no more fertilizer. These 27 plots in each field are experiment E097. See treatment details for E097 for a listing of plots which received no further fertilizer.Burning MethodsIn the spring of 1992, 3 randomly chosen replicates of each nutrient treatment of E002 in field B were chosen to be burned each spring. In preparation for burning, the perimeter of groups of plots to be burned is mowed using a lawn mower. The cuttings and litter remaining are raked into the area to be burned. This firebreak is then reinforced by wetting the cropped vegetation with a high pressure water hose attached to a 125 gallon water tank. A backfire is started to widen the firebreak. A drip torch is then used to start the groups of plots (one at a time) on fire. For a list of burn treatments for each plot, see file trmte98. On May 5, 1995, a wildfire burned all plots in experiment 002 in field B.'Microplot' Fertilization TreatmentsThe 'microplot' fertilization treatments are used in experiments 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 23, 25, and 52. Experiments 5, 6, 28, 36,53,97, 98 and 100 are conducted within plots that are fertilized and should be treated as part of the fertilized plot. There are nine treatment levels, assigned a letter A through I. This is also equivalent to the numeric labels 1 to 9. Treatment levels A through H differ in the amount of NH4NO3 added. Treatment I is a true control and receives no nutrients. The nutrients are applied twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. An exception is experiment 25 where time of application is experimentally manipulated. Not all experiments use all possible treatments. Nutrients are given in g/m2 for each fertilization; plot area and treatments used follow the nutrient lists. Treatment A to H receive the following base nutrients: Rate Volume Element 10 g/m2 150 ml P2O5 (0-46-0) 10 g/m2 150 ml K2O (0-0-61) 20 g/m2 200 ml CaCO3 (lime) 15m2 200 ml MgSO4 (Epsom Salts) 0.0625 ml/m2 trace mineral solution in 1 ml to 10 ml sand The description for making trace mineral sand is at the end of this section. The amount of NH4NO3 fertilizer added at the different treatment levels is: Treatment Rate Volume A 0.0 g/m2 0 ml B 1.5 g/m2 25 ml C 3.0 g/m2 50 ml D 5.0 g/m2 90 ml E 8.0 g/m2 140 ml F 14.0 g/m2 250 ml G 25.0 g/m2 445 ml H 40.0 g/m2 710 ml I 0.0 g/m2 0 ml These rates are added twice a year. Actual annual N addition is calculated as: 0.34%N * rate (g/m2) * 2 times/year The trace mineral stock solutions are made by adding the following grams of reagent to 1000 ml of water: CuSO4*5H2O 9.8 g ZnSO4*7H2O 22.0 g or ZnCl2 10.5 g CoCl2*6H2O 10.0 g MnCl2*4H2O 180.0 g Na2MoO4*2H2O 6.3 g H3BO3 6.0 g The trace metal solution is made by combining 120ml of each stock solution, adding 67.2g of citric acid dissolved in deionized water and adding deionized water to bring the volume to a total of 2 liters. The working solution is then autoclaved to chelate the trace metals. The size of the plots and treatments used for each experiment are: Experiment Treatments Plot Size (m2) Experiment 1 except Field D A thru I 16 Experiment 1 Field D A thru I 6 Experiment 2 A thru I 16 Experiment 4 E, G, I 1000 Experiment 8 C, F, H, I 16 Experiment 9 C, F, H, I 16 Experiment 11 E, G, I 16 Experiment 24 E, G, I 16 Experiment 25 E, G, I 5.25 Experiment 52 A, C, F, G 25'Microplot' Fertilization TreatmentsSome changes and/or additions occur from year to year for some experiments. These changes are listed below. Unless specific experiments are mentioned, these differences apply to all experiments in a category. In 1982, 30ml of each stock solution was combined with 16.8g citric acid, brought to a total volume of 1 liter, and autoclaved to dissolve. 1.5ml of this solution was added to 30ml of silica sand, mixed and dried. In 1983, 60ml of each stock solution was combined with 25g of EDTA brought to 1 liter, and autoclaved to dissolve. 1ml of this solution was added to 10ml of sand and added to each plot. In 1984, 60ml of each stock solution was combined with 25g of citric acid and brought to 1 liter. In 1985, the first fertilization for experiments 1 and 2, Treatment F received an extra 23 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 118.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received an extra 132.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, between fertilizations for experiments 1 and 2, Treatment G received 137.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received 206.25 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, the second fertilization for experiments 1 and 2, Treatment F received an extra 23.0 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 252.7 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received an extra 441.1 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, the first fertilization for experiment 4, Treatment E received no CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 45.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, both fertilizations for experiments 8, 9, and 11, Treatment F received an extra 23 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 43.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received an extra 57.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1989, lime was added to adjust pH to the following treatments in the spring: Quantities of lime stone (g/plot): Experiment 2 Treatment Field A Field B Field C A 0 0 0 B 0 0 320 C 0 0 0 D 0 800 320 E 800 0 600 F 800 0 1200 G 500 0 500 H 600 0 1600 I 0 0 0 In the fall of 1989, each plot receiving treatments B, C, D, E, F, G and H in field D of experiment 1, received 1067g of lime to adjust pH.Field Operations: FencingThe plots in experiment 002 are enclosed by a fence to exclude mammalian herbivores. The fencing remained until the fall of 2004, when it was removed completely. Galvanized welded-wire hardware cloth with 6mm x 6mm openings was buried to a depth of 84cm. Additional hardware cloth extends 60cm above the ground, and poultry netting extends to 1.8m above the ground. During the summer of 1986, aluminum flashing was placed in the ground to a depth of 12 inches. This flashing surrounds each plot in each field, keeping the plants from spreading between plots by belowground vegetative reproduction. The aluminum flashing is placed 12 inches from the edge of each plot.Burning LTER PlotsAll of the burning done within LTER experiments at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve are done in late April or early May. Burn permits are issued to Cedar Creek Natural History Area for this time, and the following areas within Cedar Creek, by the Department of Natural Resources (headquarters in Cambridge, MN). In all cases, several people are on hand to help contain the fire. Tools used are 'flappers', shovels and hand-pumped, portable water spray-cans. Drip torches containing a mixture of 1/3 gasoline and 2/3 diesel are used to start the fires. A truck carrying a high pressure water sprayer hooked up to a 125 gallon tank of water is always nearby. After the fires are burned out, any remaining hotspots are extinguished or moved to the center of the burned area to insure the prevention of wildfires. 125 gallon water tank and Minnesota Warmer Co. model KW125-7-10 utility sprayer.Field Operations: BurningStarting in 1992, 3 replicates of each nutrient treatment were burned in field B each spring.

00075-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"2003"
00075-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"One technique that has been used to analyze individual atmospheric particles is automated electron microscopy. This technique gives the size, shape, and elemental composition of individual particles and has been used successfully for particles collected on filters in particle samplers. The goal of the current project is to mimic this electron microscopy analysis technique for particles deposited on leaf surfaces. Preliminary results demonstrate that electron microscopy can be used successfully to analyze individual particles on leaf surfaces. The ability to analyze atmospheric particles on leaf surfaces leads to a specific application: determining the spatial distribution of atmospheric particles throughout urban areas, namely Phoenix. Evidence from past studies in Phoenix indicate that the distribution of particle types is non-uniform, and sampling with a limited number of particle samplers is not adequate for capturing this variability. Using leaves gives the ability to sample in more locations. In a preliminary study, three sampling locations from the Phoenix area - a desert, an urban, and a suburban site - were chosen as test sites to determine whether different particle types could be observed on leaf surfaces from the different sites. The particle types from the desert site contain only elements comprising desert dust. The particle types from the urban and suburban sites consist partially of elements found in desert dust, but they also contain sulfur, which is likely from anthropogenic sources within the urban area. These preliminary results indicate that the distribution of particle types throughout an urban area can be determined from the analysis of particles on leaf surfaces. A more detailed study is in progress. Leaves from twenty-eight sampling sites around the Phoenix area have been collected and will be analyzed with a method similar to that used in the preliminary study. The twenty-eight sites were chosen based on land-use data. In addition to determining the spatial distribution of particle types, another objective of this work correlate the particle types with the land-use data from which they were collected."

For each sample, leaves or filters were collected or placed near the edges of the trees at approximately 2.5 m above the ground with few or no leaves above them. All samples were analyzed with an electron microprobe and subjected to multivariate analysis. Mesquite leaves were collected on June 19 and 29, 2001, from twenty locations within the Phoenix metropolitan area (Figure 3-1). The leaves were dried at room temperature for at least two weeks. Square portions of each leaf, approximately 2 mm per side, were affixed to an aluminum stub with conductive carbon tape. One leaf per tree was analyzed. In order to determine the spatial variability of deposited particles on leaves within one tree, eight leaves were collected from a tree on June 8, 2002. The leaves were collected from the north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest sides of the tree. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was performed on the concentrations of 66 the analyzed particle groups. We chose the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test because it is a nonparametric test in which the distribution of the sample does not need to be known. The third data set involved the simultaneous collection of leaves and filters from one tree during April 2001. The purpose of this data collection was to compare the particle types between the leaves and filters in order to identify the particles that were deposited. Because the filter was clean when it was placed in the tree, the particles on the filter were assumed to be deposited from the area surrounding the exposed filter. Particles that were observed on both the filter and leaves were considered deposited. Particle types that differed between the two surfaces were examined to determine their origins. For this collection, a square piece of Nuclepore polycarbonate filter, approximately 5 mm on a side, was affixed to an aluminum stub and placed on a mesquite tree branch. Polycarbonate filters were chosen because they are commonly used in particle samplers for individual-particle analysis (Post and Buseck, 1984; Katrinak et al., 1995; Anderson et al., 1996; Gao and Anderson, 2001). The filter remained in the tree from two to seven days. When the filter was collected, leaves near the filter were also collected, and a clean filter was placed into the tree. Six filter and six leaf samples were collected over a three-week period. The resulting compositions and sizes of the particle groups on the leaves and filters were compared. The purpose of the fourth set of data was to obtain spatial deposition patterns of particle groups collected on filters. These results were then compared with those 67 collected on leaves. Polycarbonate filters were affixed to aluminum stubs and placed in trees at ten sampling locations from October 29 to November 4, 2002 (Figure 3-1). Automated Electron Microprobe Analysis Before analysis in the microprobe, all leaf and filter samples were carbon-coated to improve conductivity. The individual-particle analysis technique was similar to that used in previous studies (Anderson et al., 1992, 1996; Katrinak et al., 1995). We used an automated JEOL Model JXA-8600 electron microprobe with NORAN Voyager-IV image analysis and automation and equipped with a NORAN Be-window energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS). We used the following operating conditions: accelerating voltage - 15 kV, beam current - 400 pA, working distance - 11 mm, and magnification - 4,000x. X-ray spectra were acquired for 60 seconds at energies between 0 - 20 keV; relative dead times were less than 30%. We analyzed 50 to 400 particles per sample. Back-scattered electron (BSE) images were obtained with an annular, split-ring, semi-conductor detector, mounted 11 mm from the sample. BSE images were preferred over secondary-electron images because the atomic number contrast is greater, little topographic information is revealed, and the effects of electron-beam charging are reduced, all of which are important in the analysis of individual particles (Germani and Buseck, 1991). The greater atomic number contrast was especially important on the leaves, where the greater contrast allowed for the analysis of particles with similar 68 compositions to the leaves. The resolution for each image frame was 1,024 by 1,024 pixels, and each pixel width was 0.022 μm. The final BSE image was produced from the average of three images, each with dwell times of 3,200 microseconds per pixel. The analyses were performed on the smooth portions of the leaves to maintain the focus in the images, a necessary condition for the analysis. Although in previous studies with oak leaves, more particles were observed on surface irregularities, such as veins, than on smooth portions of leaves (Lindberg et al., 1982; Coe and Lindberg, 1987), we did not notice a significant difference on mesquite leaves. The upward-facing surfaces of the leaves were analyzed, as more particles were observed there, as opposed to the downward-facing surfaces (Lindberg and Lovett, 1985; Coe and Lindberg, 1987; Nicholson, 1988). The particles were distinguished from the leaf and filter surfaces by segmentation of the BSE images into binary images. In this process, the gray-level for each pixel was compared with a user-defined threshold gray-level. The pixels with values greater than the threshold value were assigned one; particles appeared in these pixels. The pixels with gray-levels less than the threshold value were assigned zero; these pixels contained the leaf and filter surfaces. At times, the segmentation procedure produced artifacts from the leaf, because, in some cases, leaf material was slightly above the threshold; in these instances, the composition data was useful for distinguishing artifacts from true particles. Size and chemical analyses were performed for each particle. In the size analysis, we determined the area, length, width, perimeter, aspect ratio, circularity, and location for each particle. For the chemical analysis, a rectangular area surrounding the particle was 69 analyzed; the longest side of the rectangle equaled the length of the particle. Because a small fraction of the rectangular area consisted of the sampling substrate, either leaf or filter, x-rays were emitted from the sampling surface. For most analyses, these x-ray counts were low compared to those for the particles; although, for some of the smaller particles on the leaf samples, elements from the leaf did appear in the analysis results. The x-ray spectra were quantified by comparing each particle spectrum with standard spectra for 24 elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Br, I, Ba, Pb, Ni, A, Sn, Sb, Se, Zn, and Cu. The quantified spectra were reported in unnormalized weight percents. With the Be window on the EDS, energies from elements lighter than Na could not be detected. Detection limits were applied to the weight percents of each particle before input to a cluster routine. The weight percents below the specified detection limits were given a value of zero, whereas those above the limits did not change. The use of detection limits is essential for cluster analysis of the data."

00075-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Sampling In order to satisfy the objectives of characterizing deposited particles and determining their spatial deposition patterns, four sets of leaf and filter samples were collected (Table 3-1): 1) mesquite leaves from twenty trees within the Phoenix metropolitan area on two days; 2) eight leaves from one tree at one time; 3) six sets of filter and leaf samples from one tree over a period of three weeks; and 4) filters that were placed in ten trees for six days. For each sample, leaves or filters were collected or placed near the edges of the trees at approximately 2.5 m above the ground with few or no leaves above them. All samples were analyzed with an electron microprobe and subjected to multivariate analysis. Mesquite leaves were collected on June 19 and 29, 2001, from twenty locations within the Phoenix metropolitan area (Figure 3-1). The leaves were dried at room temperature for at least two weeks. Square portions of each leaf, approximately 2 mm per side, were affixed to an aluminum stub with conductive carbon tape. One leaf per tree was analyzed. In order to determine the spatial variability of deposited particles on leaves within one tree, eight leaves were collected from a tree on June 8, 2002. The leaves were collected from the north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest sides of the tree. A Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was performed on the concentrations of 66 the analyzed particle groups. We chose the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test because it is a nonparametric test in which the distribution of the sample does not need to be known. The third data set involved the simultaneous collection of leaves and filters from one tree during April 2001. The purpose of this data collection was to compare the particle types between the leaves and filters in order to identify the particles that were deposited. Because the filter was clean when it was placed in the tree, the particles on the filter were assumed to be deposited from the area surrounding the exposed filter. Particles that were observed on both the filter and leaves were considered deposited. Particle types that differed between the two surfaces were examined to determine their origins. For this collection, a square piece of Nuclepore polycarbonate filter, approximately 5 mm on a side, was affixed to an aluminum stub and placed on a mesquite tree branch. Polycarbonate filters were chosen because they are commonly used in particle samplers for individual-particle analysis (Post and Buseck, 1984; Katrinak et al., 1995; Anderson et al., 1996; Gao and Anderson, 2001). The filter remained in the tree from two to seven days. When the filter was collected, leaves near the filter were also collected, and a clean filter was placed into the tree. Six filter and six leaf samples were collected over a three-week period. The resulting compositions and sizes of the particle groups on the leaves and filters were compared. The purpose of the fourth set of data was to obtain spatial deposition patterns of particle groups collected on filters. These results were then compared with those 67 collected on leaves. Polycarbonate filters were affixed to aluminum stubs and placed in trees at ten sampling locations from October 29 to November 4, 2002 (Figure 3-1). Automated Electron Microprobe Analysis Before analysis in the microprobe, all leaf and filter samples were carbon-coated to improve conductivity. The individual-particle analysis technique was similar to that used in previous studies (Anderson et al., 1992, 1996; Katrinak et al., 1995). We used an automated JEOL Model JXA-8600 electron microprobe with NORAN Voyager-IV image analysis and automation and equipped with a NORAN Be-window energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDS). We used the following operating conditions: accelerating voltage - 15 kV, beam current - 400 pA, working distance - 11 mm, and magnification - 4,000x. X-ray spectra were acquired for 60 seconds at energies between 0 - 20 keV; relative dead times were less than 30%. We analyzed 50 to 400 particles per sample. Back-scattered electron (BSE) images were obtained with an annular, split-ring, semi-conductor detector, mounted 11 mm from the sample. BSE images were preferred over secondary-electron images because the atomic number contrast is greater, little topographic information is revealed, and the effects of electron-beam charging are reduced, all of which are important in the analysis of individual particles (Germani and Buseck, 1991). The greater atomic number contrast was especially important on the leaves, where the greater contrast allowed for the analysis of particles with similar 68 compositions to the leaves. The resolution for each image frame was 1,024 by 1,024 pixels, and each pixel width was 0.022 μm. The final BSE image was produced from the average of three images, each with dwell times of 3,200 microseconds per pixel. The analyses were performed on the smooth portions of the leaves to maintain the focus in the images, a necessary condition for the analysis. Although in previous studies with oak leaves, more particles were observed on surface irregularities, such as veins, than on smooth portions of leaves (Lindberg et al., 1982; Coe and Lindberg, 1987), we did not notice a significant difference on mesquite leaves. The upward-facing surfaces of the leaves were analyzed, as more particles were observed there, as opposed to the downward-facing surfaces (Lindberg and Lovett, 1985; Coe and Lindberg, 1987; Nicholson, 1988). The particles were distinguished from the leaf and filter surfaces by segmentation of the BSE images into binary images. In this process, the gray-level for each pixel was compared with a user-defined threshold gray-level. The pixels with values greater than the threshold value were assigned one; particles appeared in these pixels. The pixels with gray-levels less than the threshold value were assigned zero; these pixels contained the leaf and filter surfaces. At times, the segmentation procedure produced artifacts from the leaf, because, in some cases, leaf material was slightly above the threshold; in these instances, the composition data was useful for distinguishing artifacts from true particles. Size and chemical analyses were performed for each particle. In the size analysis, we determined the area, length, width, perimeter, aspect ratio, circularity, and location for each particle. For the chemical analysis, a rectangular area surrounding the particle was 69 analyzed; the longest side of the rectangle equaled the length of the particle. Because a small fraction of the rectangular area consisted of the sampling substrate, either leaf or filter, x-rays were emitted from the sampling surface. For most analyses, these x-ray counts were low compared to those for the particles; although, for some of the smaller particles on the leaf samples, elements from the leaf did appear in the analysis results. The x-ray spectra were quantified by comparing each particle spectrum with standard spectra for 24 elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Br, I, Ba, Pb, Ni, A, Sn, Sb, Se, Zn, and Cu. The quantified spectra were reported in unnormalized weight percents. With the Be window on the EDS, energies from elements lighter than Na could not be detected. Detection limits were applied to the weight percents of each particle before input to a cluster routine. The weight percents below the specified detection limits were given a value of zero, whereas those above the limits did not change. The use of detection limits is essential for cluster analysis of the data."

00077-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data PoliciesObjectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusionn in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research.

00077-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data PoliciesObjectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusionn in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines.

Vectored Windspeed data corrected for period 06 Dec 90 (hr 10) to 31 Dec 90 (hr 24) as follows: If Vectored Windspeed more or equal than 0.44704 then new_val = ((old_val - 0.44704) / 0.26666) * 0.8 + 0.44704 Else new_val = old_val This correction is made for the problem mentioned in the 08 Mar 1991 Log entry below for station 46. ***NOTE*** again that since the individual sample vectors are not available this correction is rough at best with exact ERROR unknown. 08 Mar 1991. Station 46. Average, Maximum, and Minimum Windspeed data corrected for period 06 Dec 90 (hr 10) to 31 Dec 90 (hr 24) as follows: new_val = ((old_val - 0.44704) / 0.26666) * 0.8 + 0.44704 This correction was made because it was discovered that a calibration constant of 0.26666 (instead of 0.8) was being used to calculate windspeed in the datalogger program. ***NOTE*** that the Vectored Windspeed, Wind Direction, and Standard Deviation of Wind Direction data were not corrected because they are calculated from the mean vector for the hour (i.e., the mean of 1200 vectors). Thus these data fields have an unknown ERROR. G.S.22 Jan 1991. Station 46. Changed Soil Moisture and Soil Temperature fields from 0.0 to missing values (-999) for hour 13 of 11 Dec 90 since these variables are not collected by this station but datalogger had outputted 0 values. G.S.18 Jan 1991. Station 40. All data was lost during period 05 Dec 90 (hr 13) to 31 Dec 90 (hr 24) due to datalogger malfunction. Thus all observations for this period contain missing values. G.S18 Jan 1991. Station 41. Replaced all fields with missing values (-999) for hour 15 of 05 Dec 90 due to installation of new datalogger program. G.S.18 Jan 1991. Station 42. Replaced all fields with missing values (-999) for hour 11 of 05 Dec 90 due to installation of new datalogger program. Replaced Max Solar Rad value with missing value for hour 12 of 05 Dec 90 - Bad Value. Replaced Precipitation values with missing values for period 19 Dec 90 (hr 21) to 31 Dec 90 (hr 24) due to rain gauge being tipped over. G.S.18 Jan 1991. Station 43. Replaced all fields with missing values (-999) for hour 14 of 03 Dec 90 due to installation of new datalogger program. Replaced Max Solar Rad value with missing value for hour 15 of 03 Dec 90 - Bad Value. Zeroed out precip field for hour 15 of 03 Dec 90 to remove test tips. Replaced all Vapor Pressure and RH observations for period 03 Dec 90 (hr 14) to 04 Dec 90 (hr 12) with missing values due to bugs in new datalogger program. Replaced Max Solar Rad value with missing value for hour 13 of 04 Dec 90 - Bad Value. G.S.18 Jan 1991. Station 44. Replaced all fields with missing values (-999) for hour 11 of 03 Dec 90 due to installation of new datalogger program. Replaced Max Solar Rad value with missing value for hour 12 of 04 Dec 90 - Bad Value. Replaced all Vapor Pressure and RH observations for period 03 Dec 90 (hr 11) to 04 Dec 90 (hr 11) with missing values due to bugs in new datalogger program. G.S.18 Jan 1991. Station 45. Replaced all fields with missing values (-999) for hour 13 of 03 Dec 90 due to installation of new datalogger program. Zeroed out precip field for hour 14 of 03 Dec 90 to remove test tips. Replaced all Vapor Pressure and RH observations for period 03 Dec 90 (hr 13) to 04 Dec 90 (hr 13) with missing values due to bugs in new datalogger program. G.S.18 Jan 1991. Station 46. All data was lost during period 06 Dec 90 (hr 10) to 11 Dec 90 (hr 12) due to datalogger malfunction. Thus all observations for this period contain missing values. Replaced Average, Max, Min, Vectored Windspeed variables with missing values if Max Windspeed field value was 0.447 m/sec during period 06 Dec 90 (hr 10) to 31 Dec 90 (24) since anemometer froze. *** NOTE *** This potentially affects the accuracy of the vectored Wind Direction field as well; thus this field may have some unknown ERROR. G.S20 Dec 1990. KEYWORDS Added. G.S.19 Dec 1990. Station 40-46. Modified the file format and data values for the following time periods: - station 40: 01 Jan 90 (hr 1) - 05 Dec 90 (hr 12) - station 41: 01 Jan 90 (hr 1) - 05 Dec 90 (hr 14) - station 42: 01 Jan 90 (hr 1) - 05 Dec 90 (hr 10) - station 43: 01 Jan 90 (hr 1) - 03 Dec 90 (hr 13) - station 44: 01 Jan 90 (hr 1) - 03 Dec 90 (hr 10) - station 45: 01 Jan 90 (hr 1) - 03 Dec 90 (hr 12) - station 46: 01 Jan 90 (hr 1) - 06 Dec 90 (hr 09) The following modifications were made: 1. Removed the Mixing Ratio column. 2. Added columns for Max Air Temp, Min Air Temp, Vapor Pressure, Max Solar Radiation, Min Solar Radiation. Note that these columns are filled with missing values (-999) since these variables were not collected prior to the above time periods. 3. Converted units of measure for Average Windspeed, Vectored Windspeed, Max Windspeed, and Min Windspeed from miles per hour (mph) to meters per second (m/sec). The conversion formula used was: mph * 0.44704 = m/sec. 4. Converted units of measure for Solar Radiation from kilowatts per square meter (kw/m^2) to Joules per square centimeter (J/cm^2). The conversion formula used was: kw/m^2 * 359.502 = J/cm^2. G.S.17 Dec 1990. Station 45. Zeroed out precipitation for hour 18 of day 02 Jul 90 due to test tips for calibration purposes. G.S.17 Dec 1990. Station 42. Zeroed out precipitation for hour 16 of day 02 Jul 90 due to test tips for calibration purposes. G.S.07 Dec 1990. Station 45. On 9 Nov 90 (hr 14) a field technician attempted to reprogram the data logger (to correct the problems listed in the 07 Dec 90 entry below), but misunderstood directions and thus was unable to compile the program. Thus for the period 9 Nov 90 (hr 14) through 12 Nov 90 (hr 11), there were no hourly observations for this station. All observations have missing values (-999) for this time period. G.S.07 Dec 1990. Station 45. Power loss changing batteries on 5 Nov 90 (hr 16) so all variables are -999 for this hour. During reprogramming the precipitation calibration factor was set to .28 mm/tip (instead of .2716), the atmospheric pressure constant was set to 845 (instead of 829) and the 10cm soil temperature data collection routine was mis-programmed. Thus, for the period 5 Nov 90 (hr 16) through 9 Nov 90 (hr 12), the precip data was corrected (using the procedure outlined in entry 15 Aug 90 of this file), the 10cm soil temperature observations were replaced with missing values (-999), and the mixing ratio data was not corrected (because this variable is to be deleted from this database in the future). G.S.05 Dec 1990. Station 46. Replaced all variables' values with missing values (-999) for hours 12-14 of 22 Oct 1990 due to station maintenance during this period. Also zeroed out the precipitation value for 25 Oct 1990 (hour 14) to eliminate test tips. G.S.05 Dec 1990. Stations 46. Adjusted precipitation as described under 15 Aug 1990 log (with exception that the old calibration factor for station was 5.155 ml per tip), for the following period: stn46_fac = 0.1000: 31 Aug (hr 17) - 25 Oct (hr 10) G.S.05 Dec 1990. Stations 40-42. Modified datalogger programs on these stations on 05 Dec 90 (hr 13 - stn 40; hr 15 - stn 41; hr 11 - stn 42), to effect the same program changes listed in the 03 Dec 90 entry for stations 43-45. G.S.04 Dec 1990. Stations 43-45. Fixed bugs in new datalogger programs on 04 Dec 90 (hr 13 - stn 43; hr 12 - stn 44; hr 14 - stn 45). See database correction entries later in this Change Log. G.S.03 Dec 1990. Stations 43-45. Modified datalogger programs on these stations on 03 Dec 90 (hr 14 - stn 43; hr 11 - stn 44; hr 13 - stn 45), to effect the following changes: 1.

Stations 40 - 44. Changed RH chip at these stations on following hours: stn 40 - hr 14; stn 41 - hr 16; stn 42 - hr 12; stn 43 - hr 15; stn 44 - hr 11. G.S.04 Oct 1990. Station 45. Changed datalogger program on 04 Oct 1990 (hour 14) to use a precipitation calibration factor of 0.2716 mm per tip on tipping bucket rain gauge. G.S.04 Oct 1990. Station 44. Changed datalogger program on 04 Oct 1990 (hour 10) to use a precipitation calibration factor of 0.3267 mm per tip on tipping bucket rain gauge. G.S.04 Oct 1990. Station 43. Changed datalogger program on 04 Oct 1990 (hour 12) to use a precipitation calibration factor of 0.3103 mm per tip on tipping bucket rain gauge. G.S.25 Sep 1990. Stations 40 - 45. Adjusted precipitation as described under 15 Aug 1990 log, only this time for the following periods: stn40_fac = 0.2882: 01 Aug (hr 9) - 07 Sep (hr 9) stn41_fac = 0.2906: 03 Aug (hr 12)- 07 Sep (hr 11) stn42_fac = 0.3090: 08 Feb (hr 9) - 07 Sep (hr15) stn43_fac = 0.3103: 02 Aug (hr 12)- 03 Sep (hr 13) stn44_fac = 0.3267: 02 Aug (hr 9) - 03 Sep (hr 9) stn45_fac = 0.2716: 02 Aug (hr 13)- 03 Sep (hr 14) G.S.07 Sep 1990. Station 42. Changed datalogger program on 07 Sep 1990 (hour 16) to use a precipitation calibration factor of 0.3090 mm per tip on tipping bucket rain gauge. G.S.07 Sep 1990. Station 41. Changed datalogger program on 07 Sep 1990 (hour 12) to use a precipitation calibration factor of 0.2906 mm per tip on tipping bucket rain gauge. G.S.07 Sep 1990. Station 40. Changed datalogger program on 07 Sep 1990 (hour 10) to use a precipitation calibration factor of 0.2882 mm per tip on tipping bucket rain gauge. G.S.31 Aug 1990. Weather station #46 installed at Langmuir Labs in the Magdalena Mountains. First (complete) hourly observation recorded at hour 17. This station collects all variables except soil temperature and soil moisture data. The precipitation calibration factor is 5.155 ml per tip (Note that this calibration was accidently set to give volume per tip instead of depth per tip; this was corrected later). Location: Langmuir Site: Lat. 33.97472 Long. -107.1808 GS.15 Aug 1990. Stations 40 - 45. Adjusted all precipitation observations to reflect new calibration data. The algorithm used attempts to retrieve another significant digit by first converting the old ppt. figure to number_of_tips (rounding to nearest integer), then generating the new ppt. by multiplying the number of tips by the new calibration factor. The old calibration factor was 0.0254 cm per tip. Note that the unit of measure was also changed from cm to mm. For example (using station 40): 0.077cm / 0.0254cm per tip = 3.031 tips, which rounds to 3 tips, then 3 tips * 0.2882 mm per tip = 0.8646 mm ppt. The new calibration factors used are (mm per tip): stn40_fac = 0.2882: 01 Jan (hr 1) - 01 Aug (hr 9) stn41_fac = 0.2906: 01 Jan (hr 1) - 03 Aug (hr 12) stn42_fac = 0.3090: 01 Jan (hr 1) - 08 Feb (hr 9) 0.5686: 08 Feb (hr 10) - 08 Mar (hr 10) 0.6919: 08 Mar (hr 11) - 05 Apr (hr 13) 0.8155: 05 Apr (hr 14) - 27 Apr (hr 14) 0.4559: 27 Apr (hr 15) - 09 May (hr 15) 0.3090: 09 May (hr 16) - 01 Aug (hr 13) stn43_fac = 0.3103: 01 Jan (hr 1) - 02 Aug (hr 12) stn44_fac = 0.3267: 01 Jan (hr 1) - 02 Aug (hr 9) stn45_fac = 0.2716: 01 Jan (hr 1) - 02 Aug (hr 13) G.S.14 Aug 1990. Station 44. Tightened connections on datalogger side for 10 cm soil temperature sensor. This seems to have corrected the problem of intermittent invalid readings for this sensor. G.S.02 Aug 1990. Stations 40 - 44. Adjusted all precipitation observations by a constant multiplier (station specific) in order to correct for mis-calibration of rain gauges. The following correction factors were used: Station Factor Period 40 0.702 01 Jan - 08 Jan 90 41 0.699 01 Jan - 08 Jan 90 42 0.707 01 Jan - 08 Jan 90 43 0.700 01 Jan - 06 Jan 90 44 0.579 01 Jan - 06 Jan 90 This correction effectively changes the the calibration for all stations to 0.0254 cm per tip for the above shown period. Note that the datalogger programs were modified (see earlier log entries in this file) on the ending dates of the above periods to use the new calibration factor of 0.0254 cm/tip. G.S.17 Jul 1990. Station 44. Zeroed out precipitation for hour 8 of day 3 Jul 90 due to test tips for calibration purposes. G.S.17 Jul 1990. Station 43. Zeroed out precipitation for hour 12 of day 3 Jul 90 due to test tips for calibration purposes. G.S.17 Jul 1990. Station 41.

G.S.10 May 1990. Station 45. Soil temperature sensor at 1 cm depth changed (replaced 107 probed with 108 probe) on hour 11 of day 10 Apr 90. Replaced 1 cm reading with missing value (-999) for this hour. Also replaced 10 cm temperature reading and 10 cm soil moisture reading with missing values due to bad readings caused by temporarily disconnecting wires. G.S.10 May 1990. Station 42. Zeroed out precipitation for hour 15 of day 27 Apr 90 due to test tips conducted on newly replaced tipping bucket rain gauge changed. G.S05 Apr 1990. Station 42.

Added soil moisture sensors to collect data on soil moisture at 10 cm and 30 cm depths. First valid reading at hour 16 on 20 Mar 1990; all previous observations were replaced with missing values (-999). G.S.08 Mar 1990. Station 44. Replaced avg windspeed, max windspeed, min windspeed, vectored windspeed, wind direction, and std dev of wind direction fields with missing values (-999) for hour 14 of 08 Mar 1990 since these fields had invalid values. G.S.13 Feb 1990. Station 40. Replaced wind vane and anemometer sensors, because these sensors have been giving invalid readings on an intermittent basis. Therefore, changes to data base file are: replaced windspeed and direction variables with missing values (-999) according to the following conditions: (1) If max_windspeed == 1, replace avg_windspeed, min_windspeed, max_windspeed, vectored_windspeed, wind_direction, and std_dev_wind_direction with missing values. (2) If std_dev_wind_direction"

PASS uses social surveys of individuals in selected neighborhoods as methodology to explain the choices and actions of households and communities that influence the biophysical environment and the feedbacks of the environment to the quality of human life. After a successful pilot study in 2001-2002, data gathering for a much larger survey of 800 households in 40 neighborhoods is nearly completed. PASS 2006 is the benchmark for planned long-term social monitoring that will complement ecological monitoring in the CAP LTER study region"

00081-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"These data is part of the effort to provide the most detailed data on air quality in CAPLTER. This dataset represents spatially interpolated ozone (O3) levels as measured by monitroring stations of the Maricopa County Air Quality Department. O3 is a naturally occurring compound in which three oxygen atoms combine together. This is an unstable combination, and ozone is continually going through a natural cycle of being formed and then converting back to the more stable â€œnormalâ€� double oxygen compound (O2). The cycle occurs fairly rapidly. In the stratosphere (6 miles and more above the earth), naturally occurring ozone has a beneficial effect of screening out harmful ultraviolet light from the sun. However, ground-level ozone is a pollutant and is a major component of the brown haze that is often observed in the Maricopa County valley. Ozone is not directly emitted into the air, but rather forms in a complex reaction that involves heat, sunlight, and a â€œsoupâ€� of toxic pollutants, especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Some of the most common sources of VOCs are gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, and combustion products of fuels and consumer products. Ozone is created by sunlight acting on nitrates (NOX) and VOCs from motor vehicles and stationary sources, and can be carried hundreds of miles from their origins. Ozone affects the respiratory system in people and animals, and also affects the growth of plants."

00082-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The role of urban vegetation on NOx-derived dry deposition fluxes was investigated for the arid Phoenix (Arizona, USA) metropolitan area using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) (9-13 June 1998). A new land cover classification and updated land cover data were introduced in the model to account for spatial extent and heterogeneity of urban land cover. Adjustments were made in the deposition velocity calculations to consider the adaptation of local plants to the environmental conditions of Central Arizona. According to the simulations 25 % of the NOx derived dry deposition fluxes in the urban area were deposited on vegetation. When urban vegetation was excluded from the simulations NO2 deposition was reduced by 57 % because of the significantly lower deposition velocities of impervious compared to vegetated surfaces; nitric acid deposition was relatively unchanged. Using a diagnostic model with input data from urban air quality monitoring sites, hourly NO and NO2 dry N deposition fluxes were simulated for the entire year 1998 to ~6 kg ha-1 yr-1. Dry deposition declined during the summer months, due to lower pollutant concentrations and temperature-induced closure of the plant stomata during afternoon hours."

Using a diagnostic model with input data from urban air quality monitoring sites, hourly NO and NO2 dry N deposition fluxes were simulated for the entire year 1998 to ~6 kg ha-1 yr-1. Dry deposition declined during the summer months, due to lower pollutant concentrations and temperature-induced closure of the plant stomata during afternoon hours. To obtain estimates of dry deposition for the whole study area, the results of the diagnostic model were complemented with the CMAQ simulations.

00083-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In 2005, annually harvested root ingrowth donut structures were co-located with previously established mini-rhizotron tubes established at four sites on McKenzie Flats located on the east side of Sevilleta NWR: 10 replicate structures in both burned and unburned blue and black grama dominated grassland plots at Deep Well, 10 replicates each on nitrogen fertilization plots and respective control plots on McKenzie Flats(20 total), 10 replicates in creosote dominated shrubland at the Five Points Creosote Core site and in 2011, 13 structures were put in the Monsoon site. Roots and soil are harvested annually in late fall after the growing season, and structures are reestablished in situ for consecutive harvests each year. Each structure allows roots to be harvested at two depths (0-15 and 15-30 cm) to estimate root production, or below ground net primary productivity. In order to compare estimates of root production from two methods, root ingrowth donuts were collocated with mini-rhizotron tubes at all localities except for the burned grassland plot at Deep Well."

Methods were adapted from Milchunas et al (2005). We use a formidable 10 diameter soil core to create cylindrical holes in the ground to a depth of 30cm without disturbing soil profile at the cylinder walls. The soil core was inserted with a slide hammer and had to be removed each time with a come-along mounted on a steel-pipe tripod. Walls were subsequently lined with plastic cross-stitch craft work canvas (macram mesh) which supports cylinder walls through time but allows roots to pass through. Two pieces of 6 diameter PVC were placed in the center of the larger cylindrical hole, set in place with bags filled with sand that act as ballasts. The two pieces of PVC were beveled on opposite ends to fit together and prevent movement of the donut center. The top cylinder went to a depth of 15 cm and the bottom piece went to a depth of 30 cm, representing 0-15 and 15-30 cm in the soil profile when stacked upon one another. Finally, sifted soil from the location was used to fill the space between the plastic canvas lining the hole wall and the PVC pipe placed in the center. It is this soil which is harvested annually at two depths. A PVC cap was placed on top of the PVC to eliminate water infiltration from rain through the donut center and to keep sunlight from disintegrating the sand bag ballast. All root ingrowth donuts were GPSed. Sample Harvest Root donuts are harvested annually in November after the growing season. Roots are harvested by first removing the sand bags from the top cylinder and placing a bowl into the center of the cylinder. The top cylinder is then removed. Soil and roots are cut away from the cylinder wall and collected. This harvest procedure is then repeated for the lower half of the donut structure. Soil and roots collected are placed in a separate plastic bag for each depth. Once the soil and roots are harvested, the root ingrowth structure is rebuilt. After harvest, soil and root samples are stored in a chest freezer until they can be processed. Sample Processing The total volume of soil from each sample is measured and recorded. Soils are filtered through a series of sieves in which to harvest the roots present in the sample. The roots are then repeatedly rinsed to remove all the soil from the sample, dried at 60 degrees C, and then weighed. Filtered data in Excel then exported it into Navicat using the import wizard."

This method is very quick, requiring only minutes at each sampling site; yet it is robust and highly repeatable, thereby minimizing among-observer differences. At each permanent seagrass monitoring site, a 50 m long transect was established at the beginning of the study period by driving steel rods into the substratum at both ends of the transect. At each mapping site, a 50 m transect was set up by extending a meter tape along the bottom in an up-current direction. Ten quadrats (0.25 m2) were placed along each transect at pre-determined random distances from one of the marker rods. A new set of random numbers was chosen before each visit to a site. Each quadrat was examined by divers using SCUBA. All seagrass species occurring in the quadrat were listed, and a score based on the cover of the species in that quadrat was assigned (0= Taxa absent from quadrat; 0.1= Taxa represented by a solitary shoot, less than 5% cover; 0.5= Taxa represented by a few (less than 5) shoots, less than 5% cover; 1= Taxa represented by many (greater than 5) shoots, less than 5% cover; 2= Taxa represented by many (greater than 5) shoots, 5 - 25% cover; 3= Taxa represented by many (greater than 5) shoots, 25 - 50% cover; 4= Taxa represented by many (greater than 5) shoots, 50 - 75% cover; 5= Taxa represented by many (greater than 5) shoots, 75 - 100% cover).

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00085-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The role of urban vegetation on NOx-derived dry deposition fluxes was investigated for the arid Phoenix (Arizona, USA) metropolitan area using the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) (9-13 June 1998). A new land cover classification and updated land cover data were introduced in the model to account for spatial extent and heterogeneity of urban land cover. Adjustments were made in the deposition velocity calculations to consider the adaptation of local plants to the environmental conditions of Central Arizona. According to the simulations 25 % of the NOx derived dry deposition fluxes in the urban area were deposited on vegetation. When urban vegetation was excluded from the simulations NO2 deposition was reduced by 57 % because of the significantly lower deposition velocities of impervious compared to vegetated surfaces; nitric acid deposition was relatively unchanged. Using a diagnostic model with input data from urban air quality monitoring sites, hourly NO and NO2 dry N deposition fluxes were simulated for the entire year 1998 to ~6 kg ha-1 yr-1. Dry deposition declined during the summer months, due to lower pollutant concentrations and temperature-induced closure of the plant stomata during afternoon hours."

00086-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In this study, the functioning of AM fungi in brittlebush (Encelia farinosa A. Gray ex Torr.) grown at an urban site and a desert site are compared. E. farinosa is a native, desert shrub commonly found in the Sonoran Desert surrounding Phoenix and used as an ornamental shrub in residential and commercial sites in the Phoenix metropolitan area. Because this shrub is common in urban and desert areas, it can be used to compare AM fungal colonization levels between these areas. In addition, the impact of AM fungi on E. farinosa growth and reproductive output was studied by attempting to manipulate the levels of AM fungal colonization using the fungicide methyl-1-(butyl-carbamoyl)-2-benzimidazole (benomyl). This fungicide has been shown to suppress colonization of roots by AM fungi with little phytotoxicity or effect on soil nutrients (Fitter and Nichols 1988; Hartnett and Wilson 2002). Hartnett and Wilson (2002) stated that the best method available to assess the roles and functions of AM fungi in natural communities is through the use of fungicides such as benomyl. Treatment with benomyl should allow for comparisons between plants that have typical levels of mycorrhizal colonization and those with lower, suppressed levels of colonization. The impact of AM fungi on the productivity of brittlebush plants was examined at an urban and desert site. Fungal colonization was greater at the desert site but biomass and reproductive output was higher at the urban site. When mycorrhizal colonization was suppressed, plants had greater vegetative growth, but there was no effect on reproductive output."

00086-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Site Choice and Sample Collection Two sites were selected for this study, an urban site, located at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona, and a desert site located at Usery Mountain Park (desert site), Mesa, Arizona. The urban site is located in the Lower Colorado River Valley Subdivision of the Sonoran Desert, the driest and most arid region in the Sonoran Desert with creosote bush (Larrea tridentata (Sess and Moc. ex DC.) Coville) and white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa (A. Gray) W.W. Payne) plant communities among the most abundant and important in this region. The desert site is located in the Arizona Upland Subdivision, which receives higher amounts of precipitation and supports a diverse amount of leguminous trees, perennial shrubs and cacti. Records of precipitation and temperature data during the study at nearby weather stations previously installed were obtained. Total precipitation at the urban site and the desert site were 24.10 cm and 33.53 cm respectively for the study period (July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005). Monthly precipitation levels were similar with higher levels of rainfall at the desert site during the months of July through October of 2004, December 2004 through March 2005, April, and June of 2005. Monthly precipitation levels were higher at the urban site during the months of November and March. There were no recorded levels of precipitation at either site during the months of June of 2004 and May of 2005. Mean daily temperatures at both sites were similar with higher temperatures at the desert site during the months of October through December and higher temperature at the urban site during the months of February through June 2005. During the months that growth was measured (February through June 2005), the mean weekly high and low temperatures were variable within a few degrees with the urban site usually warmer. General soil analysis was performed using a subsample from a mixture of six randomly collected soil samples from each site (IAS Laboratories Phoenix, Arizona). Soil from the urban site and the desert site were classified as a sandy loam. Soil pH at the urban site and the desert site was 8.3 and 7.5 respectively. Sand, silt and clay was 68%, 24% and 8% at the urban site and 66%, 25%, and 9% at the desert site. Total phosphorus, total carbon and total nitrogen were 640 ppm, 3800 ppm; and 250 ppm at the urban site and 960 ppm, 15000 ppm, and 770 ppm at the desert site. Study plant and Benomyl treatment Data were collected from Encelia farinosa, a perennial shrub found growing throughout the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts as well as cultivated for planting as a landscape plant throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area. It is a drought deciduous plant that can have glaborous winter leaves that are dropped in response to heat and drought stress. Summer leaves are smaller and highly pubescent. E. farinosa plants located at the urban site were nursery grown plants transplanted from 3.8-liter containers in April 2004. E. farinosa plants located at the desert site were randomly selected from within the existing plant community. Fourteen E. farinosa plants were selected at each site for a total of twenty-eight plants sampled for this study. A benomyl treatment (Benlate SP, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Agricultural Products, Wilmington, DE) (.24 grams of benomyl/Liter of water) was applied to half of the plants at each site using the method described by Dhillion and Gardsjord (2004). From July 2004 to May 1, 2005, two liters of benomyl solution was applied to these plants every five weeks with one liter of solution applied to the above ground foliar and stem tissue and one liter applied as a drench to the soil area under the shrub canopy. Soil was not evaluated for the depth of moisture penetration. Plant responses and measurements During February 2005, six months after the beginning of benomyl application, plants were pruned to a uniform cube with a height and width of 80 cm. Plant height and width measurement data were collected prior to pruning. Ten random leaves were collected from intersection points formed from an imaginary 3x3 grid placed over the top of the plant, with one additional leaf collected from the center of the plant and placed in self-locking plastic bags in October 2004, December 2004, February 2005 and June 2005. The areas of the collected leaves were measured using a CID inc. CI-203 Laser Area Meter with conveyor attachment (Vancouver, Washington, USA). Several plant productivity measurements were taken during mid June 2005 at the end of the spring growing season. The number of flower clusters and seed heads, when present, were collected, counted, dried, and weighed to calculate reproductive effort (Koide 1991). Seeds were cleaned by first passing through a column air blower followed by tossing and trapping the seeds in a 1.40 mm sieve (USA Standard Sieve Series Sieve No. 14, Newark, NJ). Measurements were taken of plant height and two perpendicular widths. Measurements of two perpendicular widths were used to calculate canopy diameter (Housman et al. 2002), height and two widths were used to calculate growth index (Martin and Ruter 1996). Plants were then clipped back to their starting volume. The plant tissue removed from each plant was bagged individually, dried for 86 hours at 70º C (Koide 1985) and weighed to determine biomass accumulation during the growing season. Vegetative and reproductive biomass was used to determine sexual reproductive effort (SRE) (Werk and Ehleringer 1983; Wilson and Hartnett 1997). Soil water content was determined in the rhizosphere of each plant (Brady and Weil 2002). Twenty-eight soil samples were collected August 2004, October 2004, January 2005 and July 2005 from a depth of 10 cm under the canopy of each study plant and were stored in self-locking plastic bags. Soil fresh weight and soil dry weight (oven dried at 104º C for 2 days) was ascertained from a 25-cm3-sub sample from each soil sample. Determination of root colonization Twenty-eight soil samples containing E. farinosa roots were collected for analysis of colonization by AM fungi and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in April of 2005, eight months after benomyl application began. Soil and root samples were collected from beneath the canopy of each plant to a depth of 15-20 cm. Fresh roots were separated from soil and fixed in 50% ethanol, cleared of cytoplasm and stained with trypan blue (Koske and Gemma 1989) and Sudan IV stain (Barrow and Aaltonen 2001). Percent colonization by AM and DSE fungi was ascertained using the modified intercept method (McGonigle et al. 1990)."

00086-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Site Choice and Sample Collection Two sites were selected for this study, an urban site, located at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona, and a desert site located at Usery Mountain Park (desert site), Mesa, Arizona. The urban site is located in the Lower Colorado River Valley Subdivision of the Sonoran Desert, the driest and most arid region in the Sonoran Desert with creosote bush (Larrea tridentata (Sess and Moc. ex DC.) Coville) and white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa (A. Gray) W.W. Payne) plant communities among the most abundant and important in this region. The desert site is located in the Arizona Upland Subdivision, which receives higher amounts of precipitation and supports a diverse amount of leguminous trees, perennial shrubs and cacti. Records of precipitation and temperature data during the study at nearby weather stations previously installed were obtained. Total precipitation at the urban site and the desert site were 24.10 cm and 33.53 cm respectively for the study period (July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005). Monthly precipitation levels were similar with higher levels of rainfall at the desert site during the months of July through October of 2004, December 2004 through March 2005, April, and June of 2005. Monthly precipitation levels were higher at the urban site during the months of November and March. There were no recorded levels of precipitation at either site during the months of June of 2004 and May of 2005. Mean daily temperatures at both sites were similar with higher temperatures at the desert site during the months of October through December and higher temperature at the urban site during the months of February through June 2005. During the months that growth was measured (February through June 2005), the mean weekly high and low temperatures were variable within a few degrees with the urban site usually warmer. General soil analysis was performed using a subsample from a mixture of six randomly collected soil samples from each site (IAS Laboratories Phoenix, Arizona). Soil from the urban site and the desert site were classified as a sandy loam. Soil pH at the urban site and the desert site was 8.3 and 7.5 respectively. Sand, silt and clay was 68%, 24% and 8% at the urban site and 66%, 25%, and 9% at the desert site. Total phosphorus, total carbon and total nitrogen were 640 ppm, 3800 ppm; and 250 ppm at the urban site and 960 ppm, 15000 ppm, and 770 ppm at the desert site. Study plant and Benomyl treatment Data were collected from Encelia farinosa, a perennial shrub found growing throughout the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts as well as cultivated for planting as a landscape plant throughout the Phoenix metropolitan area. It is a drought deciduous plant that can have glaborous winter leaves that are dropped in response to heat and drought stress. Summer leaves are smaller and highly pubescent. E. farinosa plants located at the urban site were nursery grown plants transplanted from 3.8-liter containers in April 2004. E. farinosa plants located at the desert site were randomly selected from within the existing plant community. Fourteen E. farinosa plants were selected at each site for a total of twenty-eight plants sampled for this study. A benomyl treatment (Benlate SP, E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Agricultural Products, Wilmington, DE) (.24 grams of benomyl/Liter of water) was applied to half of the plants at each site using the method described by Dhillion and Gardsjord (2004). From July 2004 to May 1, 2005, two liters of benomyl solution was applied to these plants every five weeks with one liter of solution applied to the above ground foliar and stem tissue and one liter applied as a drench to the soil area under the shrub canopy. Soil was not evaluated for the depth of moisture penetration. Plant responses and measurements During February 2005, six months after the beginning of benomyl application, plants were pruned to a uniform cube with a height and width of 80 cm. Plant height and width measurement data were collected prior to pruning. Ten random leaves were collected from intersection points formed from an imaginary 3x3 grid placed over the top of the plant, with one additional leaf collected from the center of the plant and placed in self-locking plastic bags in October 2004, December 2004, February 2005 and June 2005. The areas of the collected leaves were measured using a CID inc. CI-203 Laser Area Meter with conveyor attachment (Vancouver, Washington, USA). Several plant productivity measurements were taken during mid June 2005 at the end of the spring growing season. The number of flower clusters and seed heads, when present, were collected, counted, dried, and weighed to calculate reproductive effort (Koide 1991). Seeds were cleaned by first passing through a column air blower followed by tossing and trapping the seeds in a 1.40 mm sieve (USA Standard Sieve Series Sieve No. 14, Newark, NJ). Measurements were taken of plant height and two perpendicular widths. Measurements of two perpendicular widths were used to calculate canopy diameter (Housman et al. 2002), height and two widths were used to calculate growth index (Martin and Ruter 1996). Plants were then clipped back to their starting volume. The plant tissue removed from each plant was bagged individually, dried for 86 hours at 70º C (Koide 1985) and weighed to determine biomass accumulation during the growing season. Vegetative and reproductive biomass was used to determine sexual reproductive effort (SRE) (Werk and Ehleringer 1983; Wilson and Hartnett 1997). Soil water content was determined in the rhizosphere of each plant (Brady and Weil 2002). Twenty-eight soil samples were collected August 2004, October 2004, January 2005 and July 2005 from a depth of 10 cm under the canopy of each study plant and were stored in self-locking plastic bags. Soil fresh weight and soil dry weight (oven dried at 104º C for 2 days) was ascertained from a 25-cm3-sub sample from each soil sample. Determination of root colonization Twenty-eight soil samples containing E. farinosa roots were collected for analysis of colonization by AM fungi and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in April of 2005, eight months after benomyl application began. Soil and root samples were collected from beneath the canopy of each plant to a depth of 15-20 cm. Fresh roots were separated from soil and fixed in 50% ethanol, cleared of cytoplasm and stained with trypan blue (Koske and Gemma 1989) and Sudan IV stain (Barrow and Aaltonen 2001). Percent colonization by AM and DSE fungi was ascertained using the modified intercept method (McGonigle et al. 1990)."

00087-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The dataset contains a subset of the 200-point survey created for PASS (Phoenix Area Social Survey) project. The main objective of PASS is to examine the reciprocal relationships, or the interplay, between the social and natural environments in an urban ecosystem. In order to understand this complex process, social scientists affiliated with the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project conducted a longitudinal social survey of Phoenix residents in 2001. The survey measured the social ties of individuals to their communities, values and sentiments regarding communities, behaviors that affect the natural environment, and satisfaction with the quality of life in the area. The community that people experience most intimately is the neighborhood. Our central research questions ask how neighborhood social ties, values, and behaviors are connected with one another in ways that reflect willingness to act socially and politically with respect to the environment, and how changing environmental conditions, in turn, affect the quality of human life. PASS II is being designed and will be administered in 2006."

00088-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Study how the geomorphology of the Salt River channel has changed over the last 100 years and how factors such as the damming of the Salt and Verde Rivers and gravel mining operations have contributed to these changes. For more than 1,000 years there has been a city on the banks of the Salt and Gila Rivers in the vicinity of what is now Phoenix. The course of natural processes as embodied by the river have interacted with the course of human events as evidenced by the city, each exerting influence on the other. The myriad of tangled connections between the natural and social systems has inevitably altered each of them, so that understanding of one without understanding of the other is incomplete. Within the last 100 years, intensive technological development of the river resources, its space, water, materials, and biotic complements, has radically altered the natural processes and forms of the river. At the same time, the river has influenced development of the city, sometimes as a resource such as recreational space, and sometimes as a hazard such as flooding. This constantly changing fluvial system, integrating natural and artificial influences, is the foundation for the primary riparian ecosystems of the region. The research questions of this project are: (1) What has been the nature of change in the geomorphic/riparian system, and how have human and natural factors controlled the distribution and intensity of the change over the past century? (2) Why does the river have its present geomorphic/riparian configuration, and how stable is that arrangement from geomorphic, hydrologic, and geographic perspectives? and (3) How does the river respond to ongoing changes in the spatial arrangement of human activities and attending technological impacts? This project promises improved understanding of the dynamics of dryland rivers, especially how and why they change under the influence of urban development. The research also promises to provide an integrating factor in the CAP LTER effort, because the river integrates the influences of hydrologic, geomorphic, biotic, and human technological systems. The research will provide a repeatable quantitative approach to assessing the changes in the river and as it continues its millennium-long connection between natural and social systems."

00090-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"CPER Paleopedology Study – Particle and Grain Size - Grain size data from 39 pedons were compared with modal fluvial (7) and eolian (3) samples in order to characterize the origin of CPER parent materials and distinguish the origin of CPER geomorphic features. The seven fluvial sites were located along Owl and Eastman Creeks. The three eolian sites were located on the nearest undisputed dune fields located approximately 5 km north of Roggen, CO (Muhs, 1985). For statistical analysis, the sand and coarse silt fractions were shaken in a nest of half phi(0) interval sieves ranging from -1.0 0 (10 mesh) to 4.5 0 (325 mesh) for 3 minutes. Phi intervals (-log2) were utilized to normalize the particle size data for use in conventional statistics (Krumbein, 1934). The silt and clay fractions were separated by sedimentation using the pipette method. Statistical methods adopted from Folk and Ward (1957) were applied to the -1.0 0 to 7.0 0 fractions using the Sedimentary Petrology Computer Program SEDPET (Warner, 1970) to determine mean grain size (Mz), sorting (Iz), skewness (Skz), and kurtosis (Kz). These parameters were then subjected to univariate and bivariate analysis. The clay fraction was not included in the statistical computations to avoid excessively fine skewing the sample"

Sampling Protocol: EQUIPMENT: 190 Sherman large live traps, peanut butter/oats balls in wax paper (ca. 500), loose peanut butter/oats mixture, wool, (3) each of blue/green Sharpies marking pens, data sheets, 3 pesola scales (100-300g each), (3) 6' rulers, (2) boxes of 1-ga Ziploc bags, 3-4 technicians (depending on experience), a pair of dikes, pencils. PERMITS: Annual reports and trapping permit renewal from Colorado Division of Wildlife; Renewal of permission from CSU Animal Care and Use Committee; Annual reports to CPER/LTER. 1. Each web trapped for four consecutive days in late-May and in late-July. Three webs are trapped concurrently, with both upland and lowland webs represented in each period. 2. Prior to the trapping sessions, all missing flags at odd numbered trap stations should be replaced and re-marked. A single trap is placed at every other station and two traps are placed in the center ring (62 traps per station). Traps are covered with pvc shades with nails or tent stakes and oriented so that the trap is shaded. Bait balls are placed at the backs of trap doors before setting, and a small (ca. 1.5' dia) ball of wool is placed at the rear of the trap. Once set, a small pinch of loose bait mixture “chum” is placed on the open door. Begin setting traps at 06:30. 3. Check traps at 10 am, close opened traps, and record traps with animals or sprung. Record weather, using temperature at LTER headquarters. Grab animal by nape of neck and mark throat and chest thoroughly with marking pen (each web in a given trapping period will use a different color mark). If an animal has already been captured and marked, always re-mark. Record age, sex, reproductive status, and identify animal to species (see codes). Weigh animal in bag and record mass. Release animal at capture location. Weigh bag and remaining contents, and calculate mass by subtraction. Wash traps, re-bait, and replace wool at head quarters. Make sure that all traps are closed. 4. At 06:00, replace clean traps at correct stations and re-open all traps with re-bait “chum” on the doors. 5.

00091-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem ecologists study the same phenomena (e.g., nutrient cycling, energy flow, succession) but they do so within separate conceptual frameworks. Terrestrial frameworks address state factors of climate, organisms, parent material, topography, and time to understand ecosystem processes within a location, but less often consider how ecosystems are connected. Aquatic ecologists, especially those studying flowing waters, emphasize the role of water as a means of propagating processes and materials through space and time. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems contain hydrologic vectors as well as soils or sediments that record the influences of state factors. This dissertation is an investigation of carbon and nitrogen cycling in the stream-riparian corridor of the San Pedro River, a large desert river, and tests the relative effects of soil characteristics and hydrologic vectors. Riparian zones are well suited to such investigations because they are spatially heterogeneous and subject to material and water inputs from multiple hydrologic vectors. Spatially explicit methods showed that flood vectors homogenized soil characteristics and denitrification along a stream reach with frequent overbank floods, whereas soils of a riparian site that was infrequently inundated by floods were heterogeneous. Legacies of previous floods appeared to determine the spatial locations of denitrification at the latter site. At a plot scale, manipulation of precipitation and flood vectors across a gradient of soil types showed that water functioned as an essential resource during the dry season, resulting in increased emissions of trace gases following simulation of floods. Following inundation of riparian soils by several monsoon floods, however, further addition of water appeared to suppress biogeochemical activity by decreasing oxygen availability. Thus desert riparian ecosystems appear to shift seasonally along a terrestrial-aquatic continuum, functioning similarly to terrestrial ecosystems during dry seasons, but like wetlands following inundation by floods. Finally, analyses encompassing several years of observations revealed strong correlations between regimes of hydrology and resource availability. Overall, this study demonstrates that the hydrologic regime drives spatial and temporal patterns in biogeochemical processes, but that soil characteristics may modify the duration and magnitude of biological responses to hydrologic vectors in desert riparian ecosystems."

00091-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Gas sampling The study was conducted in riparian floodplains of the San Pedro River during the dry and monsoon seasons in summers of 2005 and 2007. The upper basin of the San Pedro (~7,600 km2) is drained by an unregulated, perennially flowing river near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. Plots were established at two study sites, which were similar in hydrologic and biological features. Results did not differ significantly between sites and distinctions are therefore not made between the sites. The study sites lie at approximately 1300 m elevation and receive 300 to 750 mm of precipitation annually, largely confined to two distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon storms (July-September). A hot, dry summer (May-July) precedes the monsoon season. Median of daily stream discharge values during the dry season of both years was 0.05 m3 s-1 (USGS gage #09471000, located ~3 and10.5 km downstream from the study sites). Median discharge of the monsoon season was 1.42 m3 s-1 in 2005 and 0.58 m3 s-1 in 2007. Flash floods of instantaneous discharge >30 m3 s-1 inundated the floodplains during both study years. Field sampling was conducted in wide riparian floodplains (>250 m) along gaining reaches (Pool and Coes 1999, Baillie et al. 2007) of the stream. The sites feature perennial stream flow, shallow groundwater, abundant hydric plant species, and productive vegetation. Such sites are typical of riparian ecosystems within the Upper San Pedro Basin (Brooks and Lemon 2007, Stromberg et al. 2007). Vegetative communities are dominated by cottonwood trees (Populus fremontii), seepwillow shrubs (Baccharis salicifolia and B. emoryi), native bunchgrass (Sporobolus wrightii) and two invasive grasses: Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense) and Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon). A layer of cottonwood leaf litter covers the soil surface throughout much of the study site. Soils are spatially heterogeneous and experimental plots were selected to encompass this variation. Soil texture of sampled plots ranged from sandy loam to clay loam. Prior to wetting experiments, soils were collected from each plot for determination of nutrient and organic matter content, texture, and initial water content. Soils were collected manually using a copper ring pounded to a depth of 2 cm. Soils for nutrient determination were kept in a cooler until extraction, which was performed within 24 h of sample collection. Available nutrient content of soils was determined by extraction of soil in 2 M KCl by vigorous shaking for 1 h. Resulting extracts were filtered through pre-leached, ashless Whatman 42 filter papers and frozen until analysis for NH4+-N (phenol-hypochlorite method) and NO3--N (cadmium reduction method) on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Soil moisture was determined gravimetrically by drying subsamples at 105oC for 48 hours. Organic matter content was determined as ash-free dry mass by combustion of subsamples at 550oC for 4 h. The density hydrometer method was used to determine soil texture following dispersion of clay in sodium hexametaphosphate (Robertson et al. 1998). Sand content was determined gravimetrically by rinsing subsamples through a 53-micro meter sieve. All analyses of soils were conducted on the less than 2-mm fraction. Experimental wetting treatments were applied to each of 16 replicate plots with eight plots established at each of the two study sites. Plots were randomly stratified to account for spatial heterogeneity in soil characteristics of the sites and were located ~10 m to 200 m from the stream. In 2005, plots received only a precipitation treatment. A 1-cm precipitation event was simulated by applying water to 1-m2 plots using a watering can. In 2005, event water was synthesized to match regional precipitation chemistry and contained 1.5 mg N or C/L as NO3-, NH4+, and DOC (T.K. Harms, unpublished data and J. Koch, personal communication). In 2007, each (size?) plot was divided into two sub-plots, with one sub-plot receiving a precipitation treatment and the other a flood treatment. To facilitate application of simulated floods, water applied to plots in 2007 was collected from the stream. Water applied to plots in the dry season contained 0.06 mg/L NO3--N, 0.02 mg/L NH4+-N, and 1 mg/L DOC. In the monsoon season, water contained 0.05 mg/L NO3--N, 0.03 mg/L NH4+-N, and 2 mg/L DOC. Precipitation events (1 cm) were applied to 0.5-m2 plots and flood events (20 cm) were applied within the base of chambers used for gas sampling (0.14 m2; described below). C and N in experimental event water constituted a small fraction of the N and organic matter contained in the soils. Gas and soil samples were collected from each sub-plot prior to application of treatments and minimally at 0.5 and 24 h following treatment (dry-season flood treatment). Other experiments were additionally monitored at 2, 4, and/or 48 h. Soil samples were collected from the treated area as previously described following the conclusion of gas sampling at each time interval using a 5-cm diameter core, stored in air-tight plastic bags, and analyzed for water content in the laboratory In 2007, redox potential was measured in soils following gas collection. Probes were constructed of a platinum electrode and copper wire soldered to a brass rod. The Pt-brass junction was insulated with marine-grade epoxy and heat-shrink tubing. Electrodes were checked for accuracy and precision in the laboratory using Light solution and water, respectively (Wafer et al. 2004). Pt electrodes were inserted 2 cm into the soil at a 45o angle. Salt bridges constructed of perforated PVC filled with 2M KCl in agar were used to ensure electrical connection with soil. For each measurement, 2M KCl solution was added to the salt bridge and a Calomel reference electrode was placed in contact with the agar and the reference and Pt electrodes were connected to a current meter. Field measurements were corrected to the standard H2 electrode by adding 250 mV to each measurement Emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were measured using static chambers. All chambers were attached to bases driven into the soil at least 2 h prior to sampling to minimize disturbance effects. Insulated stainless steel chambers were attached to stainless steel bases, with vacuum grease applied to weatherstripping at the chamber-base junction to provide a gas-tight seal. Total chamber volume was approximately 20 L. Chambers were incubated for 45 minutes, with gas samples withdrawn every 15 minutes. A 20 mL sample was collected into a nylon syringe via a septum in the chamber lid and air returned to the headspace passively via a vent. Headspace gas samples were immediately transferred to evacuated 10-mL vials that had been flushed with N2. Certified samples were similarly collected and transported to the field site to check for sample preservation. Air and soil temperature were obtained during chamber incubations. Trace gas concentrations were measured on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity, electron capture, and flame-ionization detectors for analysis of CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively. Instrument precision was greater than 2%. Gas flux was determined as the linear change in headspace concentration over time. A relatively long incubation time was necessary for accurate determination of N2O and CH4 as these gases occur in low concentrations. Such long incubations of static chambers result in underestimation of CO2 flux. Although all incubations produced linear changes in CO2 concentration within the chamber headspace, a decreasing concentration gradient between the soil air and chamber headspace results in reduced flux of CO2 across the soil-air interface (Norman et al. 1997, Pumpanen et al. 2004). With the incubation time used here, CO2 flux is underestimated by approximately 4 times compared to dynamic methods (T.K. Harms, unpublished data). Caution should be applied toward comparison of these values with those collected via alternate methods. Patterns in CO2 flux following experimental wetting reported here were qualitatively similar to patterns measured using infrared gas analyzer to measure fluxes following experimental precipitation in 2005. grid sampling The study was conducted within the upper basin (catchment area ~7,600 km2) of the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona, USA (Fig. 1). The upper basin is drained by an unregulated stream located near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. The study sites lie at approximately 1200 m elevation and average annual precipitation in the basin ranges 300 to 750 mm, largely confined to two distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon storms (July-September). Weather preceding the monsoon storms is hot and dry (May-July). Two reaches were selected that are bordered by wide (>100-300 m) floodplains and contrast in hydrologic characteristics. The stream at the xeric site is characterized by losing hydrology and at the mesic site by gaining hydrology (Baillie et al. 2007; Pool and Coes 1999). Because stream channels of losing reaches are higher in elevation than the regional groundwater table, water discharges from the stream to the aquifer. The xeric site is thus characterized by ephemeral discharge and dry periods occur in summer prior to onset of floods during the monsoon season, whereas the stream at the mesic site is perennial. Recurrence interval of discharges capable of inundating the entire floodplain at the xeric site is on the order of years, whereas multiple floods inundate the mesic floodplain each year. During the period of this study, overbank floods did not inundate the entire floodplain at the xeric site. At the xeric site, median discharge was 0 m3/s during the dry season and 1.95 m3/s in the monsoon season (USGS gage # 09471550, ~7 km downstream of the study site). At the mesic site, median discharge was 0.04 m3/s during the dry season and 2.46 m3/s in the monsoon season (USGS gage # 09471000, ~10.5 km downstream from the study site). Both floodplains are bounded by a mesquite (Prosopis velutina)-dominated terrace situated 3-5 m above the riparian zone. Vegetative communities of the floodplains are dominated by cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and mesquite trees, seepwillow shrubs (Baccharis salicifolia and B. emoryi), native bunchgrass (Sporobolus wrightii), and Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), a non-native grass. The xeric site also contains rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), a perennial shrub. Compared to the mesic site, the xeric site supports sparse vegetation cover with fewer cottonwood trees, and obligate wetland species (e.g., seepwillow) are confined to nearstream locations. Surface elevation of the xeric floodplain is undulating whereas elevation increases gradually away from the stream at the mesic site (Fig. 2). However, absolute change in topography is similar between the two sites. We established one 20 m x 100 m study plot along each reach. Plots were located adjacent and perpendicular to the active channel, extending 100 m into the riparian floodplain (Fig. 1). To facilitate geostatistical analysis, a regular grid was overlain with random points to yield 175 sampling locations per reach. The regular grid was spaced at 5 m intervals on the axis parallel to the stream, and random points were established at a density of 1 point/25 m2. Spacing of the regular grid was chosen to reflect average spacing of perennial trees and shrubs. Soils were sampled twice at each point, once during the dry season and once during the monsoon season. Analysis of soils included available inorganic N, moisture, organic matter, texture, and potential rate of denitrification. Soil inorganic N was estimated as the ion-exchangeable fraction. Resin bags were constructed of 4 g mixed-bed ion-exchange resin enclosed in a nylon bag. In May 2006 we buried two replicate resin bags to 5 cm depth at each sampling point. Following 30 days of incubation, we retrieved the resin bags to individual plastic bags and collected one soil sample from each point. Soils were collected manually from within a copper ring (8 cm diameter) inserted to 8 cm depth. Soils and resin bags were transported on ice to the laboratory. Resin bags were then frozen until extraction. Soils were analyzed for moisture and organic matter content, texture, and potential rate of denitrification. Except for texture, these analyses were completed within 3 days of collection. Resin bags were again deployed during the monsoon season. Bags were deployed at the mesic site in August and two weeks later at the xeric site. Floods prevented access to the xeric site until this date. Floods again prevented access to both sites until mid-September when resin bags and soil samples were collected. Deposition of sediment at the mesic site resulted in significant loss of resin bags during the monsoon season (~60%). Mass of nutrients adsorbed to resins was measured by extraction of resins in 2 M KCl with vigorous shaking for 1 h. Resulting extracts were filtered through pre-leached, ashless Whatman 42 filter papers and frozen until analysis for NH4+-N (phenol-hypochlorite method) and NO3--N (cadmium reduction method) on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Analyses of bulk soil were conducted on the less than 2mm fraction. Soil moisture was determined gravimetrically by drying subsamples at 105oC for 48 hours. Organic matter content was determined as ash-free dry mass by combustion of subsamples at 550oC for 4 h. The density hydrometer method was used to determine soil texture following dispersion of clay in sodium hexametaphosphate (Robertson et al. 1999)and sand content was determined gravimetrically by rinsing subsamples through a 53-μm sieve. Soil texture was analyzed only during the dry season. Potential rate of denitrification was assayed using the acetylene-block technique (Yoshinari et al. 1977). Soils were amended with a solution of dextrose (100 mg dextrose-C L-1) and nitrate (100 mg NO3--N L-1). Chloramphenicol (10 mg L-1) was added to prevent new protein synthesis. Resulting slurries were made anoxic by addition of N2 and acetylene was added to approximately 10% v/v headspace. Bottles were then vented to bring headspace equal to atmospheric pressure, shaken manually until all particles were suspended, and initial headspace gas samples were collected into evacuated vials. A final headspace sample was collected after 4 hours of incubation, again following vigorous shaking. Resulting gas samples were analyzed for N2O on a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron-capture detector and Porapak-Q columns. Temperature-specific Bunsen coefficients were used to account for N2O in the aqueous portion of slurries. Soil and water solute timeseries sampling Field sampling was conducted in the upper basin of the San Pedro River, AZ, USA (~7,600 km2), an unregulated, perennially flowing river near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. The study site lies at approximately 1300 m elevation and receives 300 to 750 mm of precipitation annually, largely confined to two distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon storms (July-September). Streamwater samples were collected from a hydrologically gaining reach (Pool and Coes 1999, Baillie et al. 2007) and soil and shallow groundwater were collected from the adjacent floodplain. The floodplain as well as spatial and temporal patterns in riparian soil characteristics are described in detail in Harms and Grimm (2008). Surface water samples were collected March 2001 to September 2007 at various time intervals (Fig. 1). Shallow groundwater was collected on a subset of these dates. The dataset adequately captures seasonal patterns and although it contains some observations following storms, event-based sampling was not the focus of data collection. Surface water samples were collected in triplicate at each of two locations on the stream bordering the floodplain. Means of values for the two locations for each date were used in statistical analyses. Shallow groundwater was collected from 6 wells March 2001 through February 2003, and from an additional 3-5 wells March 2003 through September 2006. Median values across all wells sampled on each date were used in statistical analyses. Wells were constructed of 5 cm (inner diameter) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with 1-m screened sections in the zone of saturation and unscreened sections in the vadose zone. The interspace between the PVC and soil was filled with sand, followed by native substrate, and a bentonite seal at the surface. Triplicate groundwater samples were collected by pumping for 1-2 minutes using a peristaltic pump, enough time to purge standing water within the well before sample bottles were rinsed and samples collected. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured using an YSI-85 portable field probe in water that was continuously pumped from the well. Water samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and, within 24 h of collection, samples were centrifuged or vacuum-filtered through ashed, stacked Whatman® GF/D and GF/F filters (nominal pore sizes 1 µm and 0.7 µm, respectively). Centrifuged samples were analyzed within 3 d of collection for nitrate (NO3--N; cadmium reduction method), ammonium (NH4+-N; phenolate method), chloride (Cl-; mercuric thiocyanate method), and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP; ascorbic acid method) on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Filtered samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 or a Shimadzu TOC-VC/TN total organic carbon/nitrogen analyzer within 7 d of collection and total dissolved N on a Lachat autoanalyzer (inline persulfate-UV digestion followed by cadmium reduction) or on a Shimadzu TOC-VC/TN (chemiluminescence method) within 30 d of collection. Dissolved organic N (DON) was calculated as the difference between total dissolved N and the sum of NO3--N and NH4+-N. In our analyses, we also considered molar ratios of NO3-: NH4+, NO3-:SRP, DOC:DON, and DON:TN. Soil samples were collected February 2003 to September 2005 on a subset of the same dates as groundwater sampling. Soils were collected +1 m from each well. We analyzed extractable and microbial pools of C and N, and rates of microbial N transformations. We collected soils from the surface (after removing unconsolidated litter) and from the region of seasonal saturation (RoSS; sensu Baker et al. 2000) using an auger (17 cm x 8 cm diameter). The location of the RoSS varied from 60 to 180 cm depth among sampling locations and was estimated from a previously collected year-long dataset of seasonal water-table elevations for a subset of the groundwater wells. These data showed that water table elevation varied on average 40 cm annually, creating a seasonally inundated region during the summer monsoon and winter rains (J.D. Schade and D.B. Lewis, unpublished data). Soils were transported on ice to the laboratory and were processed within 24 h of collection. Samples were passed through a 2-mm sieve to remove the coarse fraction and large roots. Soil water content was determined as mass loss after drying subsamples at 105oC for 48 h and soil organic matter (SOM) content was determined as mass loss on ignition at 550oC for 4 h. Soil NO3- and NH4+ concentrations were determined by extracting a subsample with 2M KCl by shaking for 1 h. Soil particles were removed from the extract by gravity filtration through pre-leached, ashless Whatman® 42 paper filters. Samples were frozen until analysis on a Braunn+Luebbe TrAAcs autoanalyzer or a Lachat QuickChem 8000 autoanalyzer using the cadmium-reduction method for NO3- and the phenolate method for NH4+. We determined net N-mineralization and nitrification rates by incubating a subsample at room temperature in the dark for ~28 d, with soil water adjusted to fresh content weekly. Rates were determined by the difference of pre- and post- incubation extractable NH4+ and NO3-, respectively (Robertson et al. 1999). We estimated microbial biomass C and N as the difference in extractable DOC and TN between a pre-fumigation and chloroform-fumigated subsample (Robertson et al. 1999). Soils were fumigated in the dark under a chloroform atmosphere for 3 d followed by extraction in 0.5M K2SO4. Samples were frozen until analysis for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved N as described for water samples. During periods of low soil water content, this method can yield negative biomass values. We set all negative microbial biomass values to 0 for analysis."

00091-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Gas sampling The study was conducted in riparian floodplains of the San Pedro River during the dry and monsoon seasons in summers of 2005 and 2007. The upper basin of the San Pedro (~7,600 km2) is drained by an unregulated, perennially flowing river near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. Plots were established at two study sites, which were similar in hydrologic and biological features. Results did not differ significantly between sites and distinctions are therefore not made between the sites. The study sites lie at approximately 1300 m elevation and receive 300 to 750 mm of precipitation annually, largely confined to two distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon storms (July-September). A hot, dry summer (May-July) precedes the monsoon season. Median of daily stream discharge values during the dry season of both years was 0.05 m3 s-1 (USGS gage #09471000, located ~3 and10.5 km downstream from the study sites). Median discharge of the monsoon season was 1.42 m3 s-1 in 2005 and 0.58 m3 s-1 in 2007. Flash floods of instantaneous discharge >30 m3 s-1 inundated the floodplains during both study years. Field sampling was conducted in wide riparian floodplains (>250 m) along gaining reaches (Pool and Coes 1999, Baillie et al. 2007) of the stream. The sites feature perennial stream flow, shallow groundwater, abundant hydric plant species, and productive vegetation. Such sites are typical of riparian ecosystems within the Upper San Pedro Basin (Brooks and Lemon 2007, Stromberg et al. 2007). Vegetative communities are dominated by cottonwood trees (Populus fremontii), seepwillow shrubs (Baccharis salicifolia and B. emoryi), native bunchgrass (Sporobolus wrightii) and two invasive grasses: Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense) and Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon). A layer of cottonwood leaf litter covers the soil surface throughout much of the study site. Soils are spatially heterogeneous and experimental plots were selected to encompass this variation. Soil texture of sampled plots ranged from sandy loam to clay loam. Prior to wetting experiments, soils were collected from each plot for determination of nutrient and organic matter content, texture, and initial water content. Soils were collected manually using a copper ring pounded to a depth of 2 cm. Soils for nutrient determination were kept in a cooler until extraction, which was performed within 24 h of sample collection. Available nutrient content of soils was determined by extraction of soil in 2 M KCl by vigorous shaking for 1 h. Resulting extracts were filtered through pre-leached, ashless Whatman 42 filter papers and frozen until analysis for NH4+-N (phenol-hypochlorite method) and NO3--N (cadmium reduction method) on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Soil moisture was determined gravimetrically by drying subsamples at 105oC for 48 hours. Organic matter content was determined as ash-free dry mass by combustion of subsamples at 550oC for 4 h. The density hydrometer method was used to determine soil texture following dispersion of clay in sodium hexametaphosphate (Robertson et al. 1998). Sand content was determined gravimetrically by rinsing subsamples through a 53-micro meter sieve. All analyses of soils were conducted on the less than 2-mm fraction. Experimental wetting treatments were applied to each of 16 replicate plots with eight plots established at each of the two study sites. Plots were randomly stratified to account for spatial heterogeneity in soil characteristics of the sites and were located ~10 m to 200 m from the stream. In 2005, plots received only a precipitation treatment. A 1-cm precipitation event was simulated by applying water to 1-m2 plots using a watering can. In 2005, event water was synthesized to match regional precipitation chemistry and contained 1.5 mg N or C/L as NO3-, NH4+, and DOC (T.K. Harms, unpublished data and J. Koch, personal communication). In 2007, each (size?) plot was divided into two sub-plots, with one sub-plot receiving a precipitation treatment and the other a flood treatment. To facilitate application of simulated floods, water applied to plots in 2007 was collected from the stream. Water applied to plots in the dry season contained 0.06 mg/L NO3--N, 0.02 mg/L NH4+-N, and 1 mg/L DOC. In the monsoon season, water contained 0.05 mg/L NO3--N, 0.03 mg/L NH4+-N, and 2 mg/L DOC. Precipitation events (1 cm) were applied to 0.5-m2 plots and flood events (20 cm) were applied within the base of chambers used for gas sampling (0.14 m2; described below). C and N in experimental event water constituted a small fraction of the N and organic matter contained in the soils. Gas and soil samples were collected from each sub-plot prior to application of treatments and minimally at 0.5 and 24 h following treatment (dry-season flood treatment). Other experiments were additionally monitored at 2, 4, and/or 48 h. Soil samples were collected from the treated area as previously described following the conclusion of gas sampling at each time interval using a 5-cm diameter core, stored in air-tight plastic bags, and analyzed for water content in the laboratory In 2007, redox potential was measured in soils following gas collection. Probes were constructed of a platinum electrode and copper wire soldered to a brass rod. The Pt-brass junction was insulated with marine-grade epoxy and heat-shrink tubing. Electrodes were checked for accuracy and precision in the laboratory using Light solution and water, respectively (Wafer et al. 2004). Pt electrodes were inserted 2 cm into the soil at a 45o angle. Salt bridges constructed of perforated PVC filled with 2M KCl in agar were used to ensure electrical connection with soil. For each measurement, 2M KCl solution was added to the salt bridge and a Calomel reference electrode was placed in contact with the agar and the reference and Pt electrodes were connected to a current meter. Field measurements were corrected to the standard H2 electrode by adding 250 mV to each measurement Emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were measured using static chambers. All chambers were attached to bases driven into the soil at least 2 h prior to sampling to minimize disturbance effects. Insulated stainless steel chambers were attached to stainless steel bases, with vacuum grease applied to weatherstripping at the chamber-base junction to provide a gas-tight seal. Total chamber volume was approximately 20 L. Chambers were incubated for 45 minutes, with gas samples withdrawn every 15 minutes. A 20 mL sample was collected into a nylon syringe via a septum in the chamber lid and air returned to the headspace passively via a vent. Headspace gas samples were immediately transferred to evacuated 10-mL vials that had been flushed with N2. Certified samples were similarly collected and transported to the field site to check for sample preservation. Air and soil temperature were obtained during chamber incubations. Trace gas concentrations were measured on a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity, electron capture, and flame-ionization detectors for analysis of CO2, N2O, and CH4, respectively. Instrument precision was greater than 2%. Gas flux was determined as the linear change in headspace concentration over time. A relatively long incubation time was necessary for accurate determination of N2O and CH4 as these gases occur in low concentrations. Such long incubations of static chambers result in underestimation of CO2 flux. Although all incubations produced linear changes in CO2 concentration within the chamber headspace, a decreasing concentration gradient between the soil air and chamber headspace results in reduced flux of CO2 across the soil-air interface (Norman et al. 1997, Pumpanen et al. 2004). With the incubation time used here, CO2 flux is underestimated by approximately 4 times compared to dynamic methods (T.K. Harms, unpublished data). Caution should be applied toward comparison of these values with those collected via alternate methods. Patterns in CO2 flux following experimental wetting reported here were qualitatively similar to patterns measured using infrared gas analyzer to measure fluxes following experimental precipitation in 2005. grid sampling The study was conducted within the upper basin (catchment area ~7,600 km2) of the San Pedro River in southeastern Arizona, USA (Fig. 1). The upper basin is drained by an unregulated stream located near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. The study sites lie at approximately 1200 m elevation and average annual precipitation in the basin ranges 300 to 750 mm, largely confined to two distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon storms (July-September). Weather preceding the monsoon storms is hot and dry (May-July). Two reaches were selected that are bordered by wide (>100-300 m) floodplains and contrast in hydrologic characteristics. The stream at the xeric site is characterized by losing hydrology and at the mesic site by gaining hydrology (Baillie et al. 2007; Pool and Coes 1999). Because stream channels of losing reaches are higher in elevation than the regional groundwater table, water discharges from the stream to the aquifer. The xeric site is thus characterized by ephemeral discharge and dry periods occur in summer prior to onset of floods during the monsoon season, whereas the stream at the mesic site is perennial. Recurrence interval of discharges capable of inundating the entire floodplain at the xeric site is on the order of years, whereas multiple floods inundate the mesic floodplain each year. During the period of this study, overbank floods did not inundate the entire floodplain at the xeric site. At the xeric site, median discharge was 0 m3/s during the dry season and 1.95 m3/s in the monsoon season (USGS gage # 09471550, ~7 km downstream of the study site). At the mesic site, median discharge was 0.04 m3/s during the dry season and 2.46 m3/s in the monsoon season (USGS gage # 09471000, ~10.5 km downstream from the study site). Both floodplains are bounded by a mesquite (Prosopis velutina)-dominated terrace situated 3-5 m above the riparian zone. Vegetative communities of the floodplains are dominated by cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and mesquite trees, seepwillow shrubs (Baccharis salicifolia and B. emoryi), native bunchgrass (Sporobolus wrightii), and Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense), a non-native grass. The xeric site also contains rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa), a perennial shrub. Compared to the mesic site, the xeric site supports sparse vegetation cover with fewer cottonwood trees, and obligate wetland species (e.g., seepwillow) are confined to nearstream locations. Surface elevation of the xeric floodplain is undulating whereas elevation increases gradually away from the stream at the mesic site (Fig. 2). However, absolute change in topography is similar between the two sites. We established one 20 m x 100 m study plot along each reach. Plots were located adjacent and perpendicular to the active channel, extending 100 m into the riparian floodplain (Fig. 1). To facilitate geostatistical analysis, a regular grid was overlain with random points to yield 175 sampling locations per reach. The regular grid was spaced at 5 m intervals on the axis parallel to the stream, and random points were established at a density of 1 point/25 m2. Spacing of the regular grid was chosen to reflect average spacing of perennial trees and shrubs. Soils were sampled twice at each point, once during the dry season and once during the monsoon season. Analysis of soils included available inorganic N, moisture, organic matter, texture, and potential rate of denitrification. Soil inorganic N was estimated as the ion-exchangeable fraction. Resin bags were constructed of 4 g mixed-bed ion-exchange resin enclosed in a nylon bag. In May 2006 we buried two replicate resin bags to 5 cm depth at each sampling point. Following 30 days of incubation, we retrieved the resin bags to individual plastic bags and collected one soil sample from each point. Soils were collected manually from within a copper ring (8 cm diameter) inserted to 8 cm depth. Soils and resin bags were transported on ice to the laboratory. Resin bags were then frozen until extraction. Soils were analyzed for moisture and organic matter content, texture, and potential rate of denitrification. Except for texture, these analyses were completed within 3 days of collection. Resin bags were again deployed during the monsoon season. Bags were deployed at the mesic site in August and two weeks later at the xeric site. Floods prevented access to the xeric site until this date. Floods again prevented access to both sites until mid-September when resin bags and soil samples were collected. Deposition of sediment at the mesic site resulted in significant loss of resin bags during the monsoon season (~60%). Mass of nutrients adsorbed to resins was measured by extraction of resins in 2 M KCl with vigorous shaking for 1 h. Resulting extracts were filtered through pre-leached, ashless Whatman 42 filter papers and frozen until analysis for NH4+-N (phenol-hypochlorite method) and NO3--N (cadmium reduction method) on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Analyses of bulk soil were conducted on the less than 2mm fraction. Soil moisture was determined gravimetrically by drying subsamples at 105oC for 48 hours. Organic matter content was determined as ash-free dry mass by combustion of subsamples at 550oC for 4 h. The density hydrometer method was used to determine soil texture following dispersion of clay in sodium hexametaphosphate (Robertson et al. 1999)and sand content was determined gravimetrically by rinsing subsamples through a 53-μm sieve. Soil texture was analyzed only during the dry season. Potential rate of denitrification was assayed using the acetylene-block technique (Yoshinari et al. 1977). Soils were amended with a solution of dextrose (100 mg dextrose-C L-1) and nitrate (100 mg NO3--N L-1). Chloramphenicol (10 mg L-1) was added to prevent new protein synthesis. Resulting slurries were made anoxic by addition of N2 and acetylene was added to approximately 10% v/v headspace. Bottles were then vented to bring headspace equal to atmospheric pressure, shaken manually until all particles were suspended, and initial headspace gas samples were collected into evacuated vials. A final headspace sample was collected after 4 hours of incubation, again following vigorous shaking. Resulting gas samples were analyzed for N2O on a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron-capture detector and Porapak-Q columns. Temperature-specific Bunsen coefficients were used to account for N2O in the aqueous portion of slurries. Soil and water solute timeseries sampling Field sampling was conducted in the upper basin of the San Pedro River, AZ, USA (~7,600 km2), an unregulated, perennially flowing river near the Sonoran-Chihuahuan desert transition. The study site lies at approximately 1300 m elevation and receives 300 to 750 mm of precipitation annually, largely confined to two distinct seasons: winter rains (December-March) and summer monsoon storms (July-September). Streamwater samples were collected from a hydrologically gaining reach (Pool and Coes 1999, Baillie et al. 2007) and soil and shallow groundwater were collected from the adjacent floodplain. The floodplain as well as spatial and temporal patterns in riparian soil characteristics are described in detail in Harms and Grimm (2008). Surface water samples were collected March 2001 to September 2007 at various time intervals (Fig. 1). Shallow groundwater was collected on a subset of these dates. The dataset adequately captures seasonal patterns and although it contains some observations following storms, event-based sampling was not the focus of data collection. Surface water samples were collected in triplicate at each of two locations on the stream bordering the floodplain. Means of values for the two locations for each date were used in statistical analyses. Shallow groundwater was collected from 6 wells March 2001 through February 2003, and from an additional 3-5 wells March 2003 through September 2006. Median values across all wells sampled on each date were used in statistical analyses. Wells were constructed of 5 cm (inner diameter) polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with 1-m screened sections in the zone of saturation and unscreened sections in the vadose zone. The interspace between the PVC and soil was filled with sand, followed by native substrate, and a bentonite seal at the surface. Triplicate groundwater samples were collected by pumping for 1-2 minutes using a peristaltic pump, enough time to purge standing water within the well before sample bottles were rinsed and samples collected. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured using an YSI-85 portable field probe in water that was continuously pumped from the well. Water samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and, within 24 h of collection, samples were centrifuged or vacuum-filtered through ashed, stacked Whatman® GF/D and GF/F filters (nominal pore sizes 1 µm and 0.7 µm, respectively). Centrifuged samples were analyzed within 3 d of collection for nitrate (NO3--N; cadmium reduction method), ammonium (NH4+-N; phenolate method), chloride (Cl-; mercuric thiocyanate method), and soluble reactive phosphate (SRP; ascorbic acid method) on a Lachat flow-injection autoanalyzer. Filtered samples were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on a Shimadzu TOC-5000 or a Shimadzu TOC-VC/TN total organic carbon/nitrogen analyzer within 7 d of collection and total dissolved N on a Lachat autoanalyzer (inline persulfate-UV digestion followed by cadmium reduction) or on a Shimadzu TOC-VC/TN (chemiluminescence method) within 30 d of collection. Dissolved organic N (DON) was calculated as the difference between total dissolved N and the sum of NO3--N and NH4+-N. In our analyses, we also considered molar ratios of NO3-: NH4+, NO3-:SRP, DOC:DON, and DON:TN. Soil samples were collected February 2003 to September 2005 on a subset of the same dates as groundwater sampling. Soils were collected +1 m from each well. We analyzed extractable and microbial pools of C and N, and rates of microbial N transformations. We collected soils from the surface (after removing unconsolidated litter) and from the region of seasonal saturation (RoSS; sensu Baker et al. 2000) using an auger (17 cm x 8 cm diameter). The location of the RoSS varied from 60 to 180 cm depth among sampling locations and was estimated from a previously collected year-long dataset of seasonal water-table elevations for a subset of the groundwater wells. These data showed that water table elevation varied on average 40 cm annually, creating a seasonally inundated region during the summer monsoon and winter rains (J.D. Schade and D.B. Lewis, unpublished data). Soils were transported on ice to the laboratory and were processed within 24 h of collection. Samples were passed through a 2-mm sieve to remove the coarse fraction and large roots. Soil water content was determined as mass loss after drying subsamples at 105oC for 48 h and soil organic matter (SOM) content was determined as mass loss on ignition at 550oC for 4 h. Soil NO3- and NH4+ concentrations were determined by extracting a subsample with 2M KCl by shaking for 1 h. Soil particles were removed from the extract by gravity filtration through pre-leached, ashless Whatman® 42 paper filters. Samples were frozen until analysis on a Braunn+Luebbe TrAAcs autoanalyzer or a Lachat QuickChem 8000 autoanalyzer using the cadmium-reduction method for NO3- and the phenolate method for NH4+. We determined net N-mineralization and nitrification rates by incubating a subsample at room temperature in the dark for ~28 d, with soil water adjusted to fresh content weekly. Rates were determined by the difference of pre- and post- incubation extractable NH4+ and NO3-, respectively (Robertson et al. 1999). We estimated microbial biomass C and N as the difference in extractable DOC and TN between a pre-fumigation and chloroform-fumigated subsample (Robertson et al. 1999). Soils were fumigated in the dark under a chloroform atmosphere for 3 d followed by extraction in 0.5M K2SO4. Samples were frozen until analysis for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved N as described for water samples. During periods of low soil water content, this method can yield negative biomass values. We set all negative microbial biomass values to 0 for analysis."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park. There are a total of 21 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle.-81.07794623-80.4897820725.7614517124.912934922000-05-012006-04-30FCE LTER II: Coastal Oligotrophic Ecosystems ResearchEvelynGaiserFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkOE 148MiamiFL33199USA305-348-6145305-348-4096gaisere@fiu.eduLead Principal InvestigatorMikeHeithausFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of Biological SciencesMarine Biology ProgramFlorida International UniversityBiscayne Bay CampusMiamiFL33181USA(305) 919-5234(305) 919-4030heithaus@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorRudolfJaffeFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of ChemistryFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkCP 304MiamiFL33199USA305-348-2456305-348-4096jaffer@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorRenePriceFlorida Coastal Everglades LTER ProgramDepartment of Earth SciencesFlorida International UniversityUniversity ParkPC 34411200 SW 8th StreetMiamiFL33199USA305-348-3119305-348-3877pricer@fiu.eduPrincipal InvestigatorOur FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00093-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Vegetation Protocol and CAP LTER Many of the questions CAP LTER vegetation researchers are interested in are centered around the human influence on the plants. How do human chose the plants for their landscapes, how do they take care of them, and what effect does all this have on plant growth? In combination with other monitoring efforts questions are asked about how plant diversity and plant growth affect other populations in the city such as birds and bugs. At CAP-LTER we distinguish between long-term monitoring, one time observations and manipulative experiments. All of which are applied to vegetation research. We monitor changes in vegetation structure at 200 sites randomly located throughout the city and surrounding desert and agricultural lands every five years (2000, 2005, 2010, etc.). In this project, the survey 200, size and exact location of every plant in a 900 square meter plot is recorded. At a subset of these sites a more intensive monitoring of plant growth takes place. One time observations have been used to re-survey plant communities in desert remnants that were described 20 year earlier. Concentrations of elements in leaves and lichens have been measured throughout the area to document distribution of air pollututants. In manipulative experiments the effect of different landscape practices on plant performance is being tested. Popular landscaping plants are treated with different amounts of irrigation, different ways of pruning and different mulching materials. All of which influences the growth and the water needs of these plants. Your schoolyards will another site that can be used for long-term monitoring or even manipulative experiments. Information about your schoolyard vegetation can be used in conjunction with other Ecology Explorer protocols. For example the type of vegetation may influence the kinds of arthropods students find in the arthropod survey protocol. Schools which are installing a native habitat in their schoolyard should keep careful measurements of the vegetation. CAP LTER scientists also encourage you to do vegetation surveys in vacant lots, parks and golf course. Comments on the Protocol: The method for surveying plants in a schoolyard is different than using a transect method to survey plants in a desert remnant. The methods described for measuring plant attributes are similar to those used by CAP LTER scientists conducting our '200 point' survey. Grade Level: Identifying plant types can be done with the early grades, identifying them to species requires reading and sorting skills. Measuring circumferences and areas can also be done by all grades, but calculations of tree height and areas need students with higher math skills (above 4th). What is Growing at Your Schoolyard : Ecology Explorers Vegetation Protocol The Sonoran Desert has the most diverse native plant species of any desert in the world. Many plants are uniquely adapted to living here and they are part of food webs that include animals and insects that also are adapted to desert living. Phoenix is an ever-expanding urban area located within the Sonoran Desert. CAP LTER scientists are studying the impact of this urbanization on plant communities. Over the past 100 years, people have removed a lot of native vegetation and planted nonnative plants, trees, and shrubs. But there are still some desert remnants (areas that have been preserved as Sonoran Desert landscape) within the Phoenix metropolitan area. CAP LTER scientists are conducting plant surveys across the Phoenix metropolitan area. They will be comparing the survey results to studies done 20 years ago. They also are interested in comparing vegetation in desert remnants to that in residential areas, parks, golf courses and vacant lots. You can participate in this study by comparing schoolyard and, or backyard data to the surveys CAP LTER scientists are doing at 200 sites around the valley. You may also decide to correlate your vegetation studies with the LTER Ecology Explorers' bird and insect studies. Why study vegetation: - Plants form the basic foundation of food webs and support other life forms. - Native plants have unique adaptations for living in desert environments. - Nonnative plants have different requirements (soil, water, nutrients) than native plants. - The vegetation can influence the kinds of animals that are attracted to the area. - Vegetation can be a sensitive indicator of change in local or regional environments. What vegetation should we study: The items most commonly found in a school yard include grass, trees, shrubs, cacti, and ground cover. What does vegetation tell us about the urban environment: Vegetation tells us about other environmental factors such as nutrient or water availability. Differences between residential areas and desert remnants tell us about human behavior and decisions to alter the landscape. Not all residential areas are alike, so it is also worthwhile to compare differences among schoolyards and, or backyards. There may be many factors that help to explain why certain types of vegetation are planted in particular areas. Identifying non-native vegetation contributes to understanding similarities and differences between animal populations in desert remnants and residential areas. Materials you will need: Map of Your School (see 'Getting Started' if you have not made a map yet) Pencil Data Sheet Protractor Ruler Metric Tape Measure Metric Measuring Wheel (optional) Vegetation Protocol Measure (see methods below) and identify (see identification keys) A). Size of yard: measure perimeter, use geometry to calculate area. B). Estimate percentage of landcover in your study area. Record your findings in the habitat description data sheet. You will need to do this before entering data into the CAP LTER database. YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS ONCE PER AREA OF STUDY. C). Record the number, identity and size of trees: 1. count trees 2. identify species (orange) or category (palm) 3. measure circumference at breast height (CBH) 4. estimate height 5. estimate size of canopy D). Record the number, identity and size of cacti 1. count cacti 2. identify species 3. measure CBH for tall cacti (area) covered to smaller cacti 4. measure height: for small cactus use a tape measure, for large cactus estimate following procedure for trees E). Record the number and size of shrubs: 1. count shrubs 2. identify species 3. use tape measure to measure height and canopy 4. give id numbers to the plants you will be measuring Methods A and B: To measure area use either a long tape measure or a measuring wheel to measure the length and width to get the area C3 and D3: To measure the circumference of trees and tall cacti use a tape measure and wrap around the trunk of the tree. Measure at the same height for each tree or cacti. Typically this height is about 1.35m from the ground (if your students are short, than use a lower height, but make sure it is the same for all measurements) C4 and D4: To estimate the height of trees and tall cacti:Method 1: Attach a plumbline at right angles to an isosceles right triangle made of cardboard. Move until you can sight the top of the tree along the sloping edge of the triangle. Keep the upright edge vertical using plumbline. Measure the distance from the tree. Add your eye height to give you the tree's height. Method 2: Measure your shadow. Measure the tree's shadow (make your shadow measurement during the same time of day). Calculate the tree's height using the following: Height of tree divided by the tree's shadow ‘equals' your height divided by your shadow Alternatively, you can place a meter stick upright and measure its shadow in place of measuring the student's shadow. C5: To estimate the size of the tree canopy: Method 1: Measure the perimeter of the canopy and use geometry to calculate area. Method 2: Measure the diameter of the canopy, assume it is a circle and calculate the area. Formulas for Geometric Shapes: Area of a square or rectangle equals length x width Area of a circle equals pi r2 (r equals radius, pi equals 3.14) Area of a triangle equals (0.5) base x height"

00093-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Vegetation Protocol and CAP LTER Many of the questions CAP LTER vegetation researchers are interested in are centered around the human influence on the plants. How do human chose the plants for their landscapes, how do they take care of them, and what effect does all this have on plant growth? In combination with other monitoring efforts questions are asked about how plant diversity and plant growth affect other populations in the city such as birds and bugs. At CAP-LTER we distinguish between long-term monitoring, one time observations and manipulative experiments. All of which are applied to vegetation research. We monitor changes in vegetation structure at 200 sites randomly located throughout the city and surrounding desert and agricultural lands every five years (2000, 2005, 2010, etc.). In this project, the survey 200, size and exact location of every plant in a 900 square meter plot is recorded. At a subset of these sites a more intensive monitoring of plant growth takes place. One time observations have been used to re-survey plant communities in desert remnants that were described 20 year earlier. Concentrations of elements in leaves and lichens have been measured throughout the area to document distribution of air pollututants. In manipulative experiments the effect of different landscape practices on plant performance is being tested. Popular landscaping plants are treated with different amounts of irrigation, different ways of pruning and different mulching materials. All of which influences the growth and the water needs of these plants. Your schoolyards will another site that can be used for long-term monitoring or even manipulative experiments. Information about your schoolyard vegetation can be used in conjunction with other Ecology Explorer protocols. For example the type of vegetation may influence the kinds of arthropods students find in the arthropod survey protocol. Schools which are installing a native habitat in their schoolyard should keep careful measurements of the vegetation. CAP LTER scientists also encourage you to do vegetation surveys in vacant lots, parks and golf course. Comments on the Protocol: The method for surveying plants in a schoolyard is different than using a transect method to survey plants in a desert remnant. The methods described for measuring plant attributes are similar to those used by CAP LTER scientists conducting our '200 point' survey. Grade Level: Identifying plant types can be done with the early grades, identifying them to species requires reading and sorting skills. Measuring circumferences and areas can also be done by all grades, but calculations of tree height and areas need students with higher math skills (above 4th). What is Growing at Your Schoolyard : Ecology Explorers Vegetation Protocol The Sonoran Desert has the most diverse native plant species of any desert in the world. Many plants are uniquely adapted to living here and they are part of food webs that include animals and insects that also are adapted to desert living. Phoenix is an ever-expanding urban area located within the Sonoran Desert. CAP LTER scientists are studying the impact of this urbanization on plant communities. Over the past 100 years, people have removed a lot of native vegetation and planted nonnative plants, trees, and shrubs. But there are still some desert remnants (areas that have been preserved as Sonoran Desert landscape) within the Phoenix metropolitan area. CAP LTER scientists are conducting plant surveys across the Phoenix metropolitan area. They will be comparing the survey results to studies done 20 years ago. They also are interested in comparing vegetation in desert remnants to that in residential areas, parks, golf courses and vacant lots. You can participate in this study by comparing schoolyard and, or backyard data to the surveys CAP LTER scientists are doing at 200 sites around the valley. You may also decide to correlate your vegetation studies with the LTER Ecology Explorers' bird and insect studies. Why study vegetation: - Plants form the basic foundation of food webs and support other life forms. - Native plants have unique adaptations for living in desert environments. - Nonnative plants have different requirements (soil, water, nutrients) than native plants. - The vegetation can influence the kinds of animals that are attracted to the area. - Vegetation can be a sensitive indicator of change in local or regional environments. What vegetation should we study: The items most commonly found in a school yard include grass, trees, shrubs, cacti, and ground cover. What does vegetation tell us about the urban environment: Vegetation tells us about other environmental factors such as nutrient or water availability. Differences between residential areas and desert remnants tell us about human behavior and decisions to alter the landscape. Not all residential areas are alike, so it is also worthwhile to compare differences among schoolyards and, or backyards. There may be many factors that help to explain why certain types of vegetation are planted in particular areas. Identifying non-native vegetation contributes to understanding similarities and differences between animal populations in desert remnants and residential areas. Materials you will need: Map of Your School (see 'Getting Started' if you have not made a map yet) Pencil Data Sheet Protractor Ruler Metric Tape Measure Metric Measuring Wheel (optional) Vegetation Protocol Measure (see methods below) and identify (see identification keys) A). Size of yard: measure perimeter, use geometry to calculate area. B). Estimate percentage of landcover in your study area. Record your findings in the habitat description data sheet. You will need to do this before entering data into the CAP LTER database. YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THIS ONCE PER AREA OF STUDY. C). Record the number, identity and size of trees: 1. count trees 2. identify species (orange) or category (palm) 3. measure circumference at breast height (CBH) 4. estimate height 5. estimate size of canopy D). Record the number, identity and size of cacti 1. count cacti 2. identify species 3. measure CBH for tall cacti (area) covered to smaller cacti 4. measure height: for small cactus use a tape measure, for large cactus estimate following procedure for trees E). Record the number and size of shrubs: 1. count shrubs 2. identify species 3. use tape measure to measure height and canopy 4. give id numbers to the plants you will be measuring Methods A and B: To measure area use either a long tape measure or a measuring wheel to measure the length and width to get the area C3 and D3: To measure the circumference of trees and tall cacti use a tape measure and wrap around the trunk of the tree. Measure at the same height for each tree or cacti. Typically this height is about 1.35m from the ground (if your students are short, than use a lower height, but make sure it is the same for all measurements) C4 and D4: To estimate the height of trees and tall cacti:Method 1: Attach a plumbline at right angles to an isosceles right triangle made of cardboard. Move until you can sight the top of the tree along the sloping edge of the triangle. Keep the upright edge vertical using plumbline. Measure the distance from the tree. Add your eye height to give you the tree's height. Method 2: Measure your shadow. Measure the tree's shadow (make your shadow measurement during the same time of day). Calculate the tree's height using the following: Height of tree divided by the tree's shadow ‘equals' your height divided by your shadow Alternatively, you can place a meter stick upright and measure its shadow in place of measuring the student's shadow. C5: To estimate the size of the tree canopy: Method 1: Measure the perimeter of the canopy and use geometry to calculate area. Method 2: Measure the diameter of the canopy, assume it is a circle and calculate the area. Formulas for Geometric Shapes: Area of a square or rectangle equals length x width Area of a circle equals pi r2 (r equals radius, pi equals 3.14) Area of a triangle equals (0.5) base x height"

00094-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"2002"
00094-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Insects that pollinate flowering plants are often considered 'keystone species,' animals that play extremely important roles in ecosystem functioning such that their absence would have more widespread and far-reaching effects than their abundance alone would indicate. For example, the absence of pollinating insects would translate to a severe reduction in plant reproduction, which would in turn affect not only the plants but also seed-eating animals, herbivorous animals, predators of the herbivores, and so on in a trophic cascade. Such a scenario would impact not only wildlife but also human populations because insects pollinate the majority of human food-plants. While the importance of these relationships is acknowledged, surprisingly, little is known about how insect pollinator communities are affected by environmental changes, such as global climate change or urban development. There has recently been a call for research on insect pollinator communities, citing a pressing need to obtain baseline information in the face of probable future environmental changes. The Sonoran Desert has one of the most diverse insect communities in the world (particularly for members of the Order Hymenoptera [bees, wasps, and ants], which perform the lion's share of pollination duties for both native and crop plants). This community may be threatened from the presence of the exotic honeybee and from habitat alteration in the form of urban development. We propose to conduct a pilot study to examine how the pollinator community differs under different forms of urban land use in the Phoenix metropolitan area. We have three research questions: (1) How does the ratio of native species to the exotic honeybee differ among natural desert, urban desert remnants, and residential areas that also have flowering plants? (2) How does insect pollinator community structure (richness and abundance) differ among natural desert, urban desert remnants, and residential areas? and (3) How does insect pollinator community structure differ with different residential horticultural practices (xeriscaping with native plants vs. watered lawns with exotic species)?"

00096-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data Policies Objectives: The Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System (JIMS) provides protocol and services for data collection, verification, organization, archives, and distribution in accordance with recommendations and guidelines developed by the LTER Information Managers Committee (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html). Disclaimer: While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation, complete accuracy of data sets cannot be guaranteed. All data are made available 'as is'. The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data management staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request. Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period. Graduate student research data will be available online after degree completion and they have the opportunity to publish their research. Policies for re-use, distribution, or the production of derivatives: Data re-use, distribution and production of derivative products are governed by the LTER Network data policies (http://www.lternet.edu/data/netpolicy.html) in the spirit of having the potential to increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines. Appropriate citation, acknowledgement, notification and collaboration are outlined and recommended. No commercial redistribution of data and derived products are allowed. Data Acknowledgment Policy: Please send notification to the Information Manager and Responsible Investigator(s) of the data sets you are downloading and your intended use. Individuals and institutions utilizing data from the Jornada Basin LTER database are requested to place the following acknowledgment in any publication in which these data are mentioned: Data sets were provided by the Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) project.

Box 30003, MSC 3JER New Mexico State University Las Cruces NM 88003-8003 US datamanager@jornada-vmail.nmsu.edu Information Manager The Jornada Basin Long Term Ecological Research program, in collaboration with the USDA ARS Jornada Experimental Range, studies the causes and consequences of desertification: the broad scale expansion of woody plants into grasslands that results in more 'desert like' conditions. We are interested in spatial and temporal variation in desertification dynamics, and how historic legacies, the geomorphic template, transport vectors (wind, water, animals), and environmental drivers (climate, land use, disturbance) interact with the patch structure of the vegetation to determine past, present, and future ecosystem dynamics across scales. Our study site is located in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, approximately 25 km northeast of Las Cruces, New Mexico, USA (+32.5 N, -106.8 W, elevation 1188 m). Annual precipitation is 24 cm and maximum temperatures average 13 C in January and 36 C in June. Our study site includes the 78,000 ha Jornada Experimental Range operated by the USDA Agricultural Research Service, and the 22,000 ha Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) operated by New Mexico State University. The Jornada Basin LTER project was established in 1982, and is administered by New Mexico State University. This site is a member of the LTER Network, one of more than 25 long term sites funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation. U.S. National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-0618210)"

00097-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Our central objective is to use small, neighborhood parks in Phoenix to study: (1) the ways in which ecological processes are influenced by human values, use, and management; and (2) the ways in which human attitudes and activities, and the services valued by humans, are influenced by ecological characteristics and processes. Elucidating this coupling in Phoenix parks will itself be a significant step towards understanding the complexities of human-nature interactions. The information gathered in addressing the central objective, though, can and should be used to assess potential trajectories for ecological processes. Our second objective is to develop trajectories for potential changes in ecosystem services in the Phoenix metropolitan area, given economic and demographic trends, and given the signal of human-nature interactions among different social groups."

00099-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design The point-quarter technique is used to quantify the density of the shrubs at both the FivePoints Creosote and the Mixed Shrub (MS) sites. At the rodent webs two, 100 m transects are laid out across the diameter of each web. These transects were laid out using the existing trap locating rebar at 10 m intervals. The rebar used are those on the spoke running from 60 to 50 and then from 122 to 132 rebars at 5 m intervals. The stake at the center of the web is not used. This results in 20 points across each web or 80 shrubs per web. At the mixed shrub site a different arrangement was used. Every other rebar was used along every other line as a measuring point. The rebars were also staggered by 1 rebar from line to line. Ultimately there were 12 rebars used in each plot for a total of 48 shrubs per plot.Shrub Measurements In the initial sampling the shrub nearest the rebar in each quadrant was identified and the distance from the rebar to the rooting point of that shrub was measured. The height of the shrub was measured as well as the diameter of the crown at its widest point and also a diameter perpendicular to this first diameter. Repeated measures of the same bushes are performed seasonally. Data were scanned by eye to catch mistakes. Data were then filtered in excel to determine if all parameters were met."

00099-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"Location: Five Points is the area which encompasses the Five Points Black Grama and Five Points Creosote Core study sites and falls along the transition between Chihuahuan Desert Scrub and Desert Grassland habitats. Both sites are subject to intensive research activity, including NPP measurement, phenology observation, pollinator diversity studies, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent population assessments. There are drought rain-out shelters in both the Black Grama and Creosote sites, as well as the mixed-ecotone, with co-located ET Towers.Vegetation: The Five Points Creosote site is characterized as Chihuahuan Desert Scrub, dominated by a creosotebush overstory with broom snakeweed, purple pricklypear (O. macrocentra) and soapweed yucca as notable shrubs. The site is also characterized by numerous dense grass dominated patches, reflecting proximity to the Five Points Black Grama site and the relatively recent appearance of creosotebush. Dominant grasses are black grama, fluffgrass (Dasyochloa pulchellum), burrograss (Scleropogon brevifolia), bush muhly (M. porteri), and galleta (Pleuraphis jamesii). Notable forb species include field bahia (Bahia absinthifolia), baby aster (Chaetopappa ericoides), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), Indian rushpea (Hoffmannseggia glauca), Fendlers bladderpod (Lesquerella fendleri), and globemallow (Sphaeralcea spp.). Five Points Black Grama habitat is ecotonal in nature, bordering Chihuahuan Desert Scrub at its southern extent and Plains-Mesa Grassland at its northern, more mesic boundary. There is also a significant presence of shrubs, particularly broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), along with less abundant fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), club cholla (O. clavata), desert pricklypear (O. phaeacantha), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and what are presumed to be encroaching, yet sparsely distributed, creosotebush (Larrea tridentata). Characteristically, the dominant grass is black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Spike, sand, and mesa dropseed grasses (Sporobolus contractus, S. cryptandrus, S. flexuosus) and sand muhly (Muhlenbergia arenicola) could be considered co-dominant throughout, along with blue grama (B. gracilis) in a more mesic, shallow swale on the site. Notable forb species include trailing four o’clock (Allionia incarnata), horn loco milkvetch (Astragalus missouriensis), sawtooth spurge (Chamaesyce serrula), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), wooly plaintain (Plantago patagonica), globemallow (Sphaeralcea wrightii), and mouse ear (Tidestromia lanuginosa)., siteid: 2 106.717 106.717 34.3381 34.3381 1615 1615 meter"

On web 4 at the creosote site, shrub 124 was measured twice because it was unknown about if it was one or two bushes and what had been measured in the past. It was identified that sometimes in the past two bushes instead of one was measured. Made note of this to reduce the chance of this happening in the future.
