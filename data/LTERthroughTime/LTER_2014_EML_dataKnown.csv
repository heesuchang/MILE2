The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

00002-metadata.xml,Purpose,/eml:eml/dataset/purpose,"A three-level hydroclimatological network for data monitoring was established in 1994. The networks at each level are nested to form a coordinated program of data acquisition and measurement. A future vision of linking the benchmark meteorological stations with regional weather stations to expand the future scope of studies was also considered in designing this network. The first-level in this top-down approach consists of Benchmark Meteorological Stations (BMS) and Benchmark Stream Stations. The BMS are designed to represent the environment across the Andrews. These stations are intended to provide complete, long-term, high temporal resolution, meso-scale hydroclimatological data. The location of the BMS is based on factors such as elevation, aspect, vegetation gradients, and accessibility. Collected meteorological parameters are generally standardized across the BMS as well as methods and instrumentation. Secondary Meteorological Stations also follow standardized methods and serve similar purposes but are somewhat limited in meteorological parameters collected. The Primary Meteorological Station (PRIMET), Central Meteorological Station (CENMET), Upper Lookout Meteorological Station (UPLMET), and Vanilla Leaf Meteorological Station (VANMET) are the four Benchmark Stations, Climatic Station at Watershed 2 (CS2MET) and the Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET) are Secondary Stations."

Gill radiation shields replaced the PVC shields at all of the benchmark sites after a significant concurrent comparison was made. Aspirated shields are also now in use. The original 1.5 meter Primary Met Station sensor was housed in a Cotton Region Shelter. Historical methods included Rustrak strip charts with thermister where air temperature is measured by a Yellow Springs Instruments linear thermistor in a standard Cotton Region Shelter and continuously recorded on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from -10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. Data loggers are typically Campbell Scientific (CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X). Early data loggers used in the 1980s are Interface Instrument models M-2, M-3, and M-4. Thermocouple wire; Campbell Scientific model 107 temperature probe (CS107B, CS107B-L) includes the Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor; Campbell Model HMP35C or the HMP45C probe containing a Vaisala capacitive relative humidity sensor and a Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor; Campbell Scientific data loggers (CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X); Interface Instrument models M-2, M-3, and M-4 Field Methods - MS001: Dew point temperature Please follow this link to see a general description and history of dew point temperature measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=dew & topnav=135 Dew Point is calculated from air temperature and relative humidity every sampling interval (generally every 15 seconds) and output hourly using Tetens Equation for the relation between temperature and the partial pressure of water vapor (see http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/dewpt_vpd_calculations.pdf). This is calculated for independent pairs of air temperature and relative humidity probes at 150 and 450 cm heights for all benchmark stations (except CS2MET which only has sensors at 150 cm height). Historical methods at PRIMET used a heated lithium-chloride dew point sensor with a thermistor that recorded continuously on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart throughout the 1970s. An Interface Instrument hygrometer with linear thermister was used to measure dew point indirectly with a heated Interface Instrument lithium-chloride hygrometer with a linear thermistor from 1979 until 1988. The PRIMET early dew point sensors and subsequent air temperature and relative humidity sensors used to calculate dew point were located in the 150 cm height cotton shelter until May 2000. The cotton shelter was discontinued for dew point calculation and replaced with use of the 450 cm probe on the PRIMET tower. Early instrumentation at PRIMET in the 1970s included a heated lithium-chloride dew point sensor. The sensor temperature is measured with a thermistor and recorded continuously on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from -5 degrees C to 20 degrees C with and with an accuracy and resolution of 1 degree C. The Interface Instrument M-2 or M-3 data logger was used. This sensor was often very unreliable. In the 1980s, dew point temperature is measured indirectly by a heated Interface Instrument lithium-chloride hygrometer with a linear thermistor. The accuracy is +/-0.5 degrees C with a resolution of 0.1 degrees C, and range of -14 to 29 degrees C. The Interface Instruments M-4 data logger was used. All other dew point measurements have been calculated from air temperature and relative humidity sensors. Field Methods - MS001: Precipitation Please follow this link to see a general description and history of precipitation measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=ppt & topnav=135 Precipitation records are generally evaluated every 5 minutes and data points are output to capture 5 minute resolution. In actuality, not all of the gauges are designed for accurate recording at this high temporal frequency except during periods of high intensity rain/snowfall. This is generally due to the sensitivity of the magnetostrictive tank gauge and associated tank diameter in measuring fluid level. The 'stand-alone' gauges at UPLMET, VANMET and CENMET are designed for greater sensitivity to changes in tank depth and the 5 minute output is good during most precipitation events. The 'shelter gauges' at those sites are not as sensitive to a change in fluid depth. The tipping bucket gauge at PRIMET reliably outputs tips on a 5 minute basis, although this record is somewhat artificial at 5 minute resolution, especially in light rain situations where the gage does not tip in every 5 minute segment and 15 minute resolution is probably more realistic. Early chart data at CS2MET and the H15MET have been digitized and are generally accurate at 15 minutes resolution. The longest continuous precipitation record on the Andrews is at the Climatic Station on Watershed 2 (CS2MET): 1957-10-01 to Present. Data is collected weekly from a standard US Weather Bureau standard 8” rain gauge and an adjacent Universal recording gauge (chart). The weekly charts were originally hand digitized on a daily basis, and adjusted to the standard gauge total. Subsequently, all charts have been electronically digitized, and data can be reliably output at a 15 minute resolution. This high resolution chart data has also been corrected to the standard gage total on a weekly basis. This Universal rain gauge was originally positioned at another location on the Andrews (at FORKS) and that record can be used to extend the daily CS2MET precipitation record back to December, 1951. A ETI Instruments NOAH IV gauge was installed in 2011 and runs concurrently with the Universal gauge and the standard gauge At the Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET), a standard rain gauge has always been maintained along with an accompanying recording rain gauge. Historically, the charts were hand digitized on a daily basis, and the daily record corrected to the standard gauge periodic total using a prorating technique. Beginning in 1992 a more reliable recording gauge was installed using a pressure transducer to measure fluid depth, and this record is available with no correction to the standard gauge, although the standard gauge is still operational. At both the Upper Lookout (UPLMET) and Central (CENMET) Stations, two gauges are in operation: a stand-alone gauge with two concentric, encircling wind fences, and a second gauge atop the station shelter. The orifice of the stand alone gauge is heated by a thermistatically-controlled propane heater. This heated gauge with the shielding fences has dramatically improved our precipitation catch, particularly in heavy snow conditions, and has prevented snow bridging over the gauge orifice. The shelter gauge is located on top of our station shelter and heated through ducts from the shelter's propane heating system. This gauge has also improved catch over the more traditionally heated rain gauges, but is protected only with an alter wind shield and catches less than the stand-alone. At Vanilla Leaf (VANMET) the original gauge in the clearcut was installed in 1987 but the record is discontinued in 1996. This gauge suffered from its openly exposed siting in this high elevation clearcut. Heavy snow and inadequate wind shielding were major problems. A stand-alone type gauge similar in design to those used at UPLMET and CENMET was installed in the adjacent and naturally sheltered meadow above the VANMET clearcut in 1998. This site takes advantage of the naturally-protected meadow and the wind fences are not employed here. Stand-alone rain gauges with Valdais-type concentric wind fencing are designed for use at remote Andrews locations in heavy snow conditions. The stand-alone gauges are constructed in two sections: 1) a heated orifice section 2) an unheated stand pipe section, and are designed to work with Campbell Scientific data loggers. The two concentric, encircling wind fences are used at CENMET and UPLMET (see design description http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/stand_alone_raingage_design.pdf). Shelter-top rain gauges are currently in use at CENMET, UPLMET, and H15MET. The shelter-top gauge sits on top of a shelter and is heated using ducted shelter heat from the shelter propane heater controlled by the datalogger and thermistor. Continuous precipitation is measured by recorded tank depth measurements (magnetostrictve tank gauges or pressure transducer) in association with Campbell Scientific data loggers. Stevens A-35 chart recorders were used at some sites as a precipitation record backup. Wind Alter shields are typically employed. The Climatic Station at WS#2 (CS2MET) employs a Belfort Universal Recording Rain Gage, Cat No. 5-780 Series. 8' diameter, 12' capacity, and accuracy of .33%. The record is corrected to a nearby 8' US Weather Service Standard Raingage. An ETI Instruments Noah IV gauge was installed in 2011. The Primary Met Station employs a Texas Electronics tipping bucket gauge with 8' diameter orifice with data logger located on a 1 meter high platform with a Campbell Scientific data logger. Field Methods - MS001: Relative humidity Please follow this link to see a general description and history of relative humidity measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=rel & topnav=135 Generally, relative humidity is output hourly and is measured at heights of both 150 and 450 cm at these benchmark stations using Vaisala sensors with Campbell data loggers. Early records at CS2MET employed a hygrothermograph sensor to record daily max-min relative humidity from within a Cotton Region shelter on a recording chart from 1958 to 1998. Standard maximum and minimum thermometers on a Townsend support and a sling psychrometer were used to make weekly corrections to the hygrothermograph chart readings. Temperature and relative humidity are sampled by Campbell Model HMP35C or HMP45C probes containing a Vaisala capacitive relative humidity sensor and a Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor. The probes were originally housed in a locally-designed PVC radiation shield, which were later replaced with Gill radiation shields. Campbell Scientific data loggers are used. The original 1.5 meter Primary Met Station sensor was housed in a Cotton Region Shelter. Historical instrumentation include the the Weather Measure Hi-Q hygrothermograph (http://www.novalynx.com/225-5020.html), a precision, self-contained recording instrument that measures and records ambient temperature and relative humidity simultaneously on a double scale chart. A specially treated bundle of human hair is used to measure relative humidity over the full range of 0 to 100%. The hair expands and contracts with increasing or decreasing amounts of water vapor in the air. The chart is installed on a self-contained brass clock which is spring-wound with accuracy of +/- 1%. A Belfort hygrothermograph had been used previously in the late 1950s and 1960s. The Belfort Maximum Minimum Thermometer Cat No. 5-484 indicates the temperature extremes reached over a 24 hour period and is the standard for correcting chart temperature readings. Field Methods - MS001: Snow lysimeter Please follow this link to see a general description and history of snow lysimeter measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=lys & topnav=135 Precipitation and melting snow runoff are measured by a tipping bucket with tips summarized in 5 minute intervals. General installation: The lysmeter collection pan was constructed from 2 x 12s and plywood. The pan was covered with hyplon (white vinyl polymer), and a bathtub drain installed in one corner. The pan was installed on the ground surface and was leveled such that the collected water would flow to the corner with the drain. The water is then directed to a tipping bucket (TB) in the basement of the structure by pvc pipe which is buried to prevent freezing. The final deminsions of the lysimeter pan are 92' x 93' x 12', so a volume of water equal to .01' of ppt is 1.4032 L. The Campbell data logger records the Tipping Bucket snow lysimeter tips (.01' of ppt/snowmelt input). An electromagnetic counter acts as a check to recorded tips. Sensors are connected to the data logger through a Campbell wiring panel. Field Methods - MS001: Snow moisture and depth Please follow this link to see a general description and history of snow water equivalence (moisture) and snow depth measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=sno & topnav=135 Snow water equivalence (SWE) and snow depth are measured every 5 minutes. Due to high variability in readings, particularly of snow depth, values may only be posted every hour for some data. Snow moisture is measured with a Park Mechanical pressure pillow and Druck pressure transducer. Snow depth is measured with a Campbell Scientific model SR50 sonic ranging snow depth sensor or Judd communications snow depth sensor. The snow depth sensor takes up to 10 readings, performs error checking and outputs a reading in mm every 5 minutes. Depth sensor measurement range is 0.5 to 10 meters. The snow sensor is mounted on a long pipe extending from the shelter. The snow pillow readings are instantaneous at 5 minute intervals. Campbell Scientific data logger is used. Snow moisture and snow depth are merged in the output files. Snow moisture is measured with a Park Mechanical pressure pillow and Druck pressure trandsducer. Snow depth is measured with a Campbell Scientific model SR50 sonic ranging snow depth sensor or Judd communications snow depth sensor. Campbell Scientific data loggers are used. Field Methods - MS001: Snow course Snow moisture and snow depth are measured with snow cores at 5 points across a transect (see entity 20). This station snow course (transect) is near the station and tries to follow a single contour. The average of these 5 points provides a check of the snow pillow and snow depth sensor. Snow depth is also measured at each corner of the station snow pillow using a permanently set graduated stake (pvc pipe). The average depth is converted to snow water equivalence using the density calculated from the station snow course. Mt Rose snow core sampler Field Methods - MS001: Soil moisture Please follow this link to see a general description and history of soil moisture measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=smo & topnav=135 Soil moisture is measured with a water content reflectometer (WCR) beginning in 1998 replacing older gypsum block technology. Values are output on a daily basis at four depths (10, 20, 50, 100 cm) from the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) Campbell Scientific CS615 Water Content Reflectometers Field Methods - MS001: Soil moisture potential Please follow this link to see a general description and history of soil moisture potential measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=smp & topnav=135 Gypsum blocks were used to record mean daily soil moisture potential at the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) beginning in 1994. Water content reflectometers were added beginning in 1998 at all sites and all gypsum block measurements were terminated by May 2000. Hourly measurements were made between 1988 and 1990 at PRIMET but were discontinued and restarted in Oct 1994 on a daily basis only. At VANMET, soil moisture potential measurements were summarized by daytime and nighttime hours only from 1987 to 1994 at depths of 10, 20, 30 cm. From 1987 to 1993, mean daily soil moisture potentials were recorded in the rooting zone of 3 individual trees at VANMET. Campbell Scientific model 223 gypsum soil moisture blocks were used historically. A polynomial equation relates changes in soil moisture with changes in block resistance. The manufacturer supplied equation is calibrated from -.1 to -15 bars. Values less than -15 bars are listed as out of range. Data logger is Campbell Scientific. Field Methods - MS001: Soil temperature Please follow this link to see a general description and history of soil temperature measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=soi & topnav=135 Mean hourly soil temperatures are measured at the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) at four depths (10, 20, 50, 100 cm). Thermocouple wire was used in the earliest measurements and were protected inside of a PVC structure. Most measurements begin in 1994 but measurements were made at PRIMET beginning in 1988 at 20 cm depth only. At VANMET, measurements were summarized by daytime and nighttime hours only from 1987 to 1993 at depths of 10, 20, 30 cm, and soil temperature was recorded in the rooting zone of 3 individual trees. Thermocouple wire: Probe is type T thermocouple soldered from thermocouple wire or, Campbell Scientific thermistor probe: Campbell Scientific model 107 temperature probe (CS107B, CS107B-L) includes the Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor. Data logger is a Campbell Scientific, typically CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X. Field Methods - MS001: Solar PAR Please follow this link to see a general description and history of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=par & topnav=135 Mean Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is measured at Central Meteorological Station (CENMET) and output at 15 minute intervals. Maximum solar radiation is based on instantaneous micromoles per second per square meter, and the time of the maximum value is accurate to the minute. It is common for solar radiation sensors to read negative at night (-1 to -7), and negative nighttime readings are changed to 0. The daily values average in these negative values, creating a minor error in the daily values. LICOR PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) quantum sensor, Campbell Scientific model LI190SB. The output of the PAR sensor is a daily average, daily maximum and 15 minute averages, and the units are in micromoles/sec/meter<superscript>2</superscript>. Field Methods - MS001: Solar radiation Please follow this link to see a general description and history of solar radiation measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=sol & topnav=135 Total incoming solar radiation is recorded at the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) and output every 15 minutes starting in 1994. This total incoming solar radiation data is also output every day in megaJoule per m2 along with the maximum daily rate of incoming solar radiation in watts per m2 and the time of the maximum accurate to the minute. Solar radiation measurement began in 1972 at PRIMET, but much of the incoming solar radiation data from the 1970's is estimated. Values are output on an hourly basis until 1994 at PRIMET. Data had originally been output as langleys but has been converted to more standard units. Kipp and Zonnen solar radiation pyranometer with thermopile type sensor, model CM-6B with Campbell Scientific data logger located on a 1 meter high platform at Primary Met and on top of shelters at other stations. An earlier model used was the CM-5 with an Instrument Interface M4 data logger. Historical method: The signal is recorded continuously from the Lintronic dome solarimeter on a 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from 0 to 2.0 cal/cm<superscript>2</superscript>/min with a resolution of 0.1 cal/cm<superscript>2</superscript>/min. Data loggers used were the Interface Instrument M-2 or M-3. This historical solar sensor was often unreliable. Field Methods - MS001: Watervapor pressure deficit Please follow this link to see a general description and history of water vapor pressure deficit measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=vpd & topnav=135 Vapor pressure deficit values are calculated and output hourly from air temperature and relative humidity probes that sample every 15 seconds. Values are output in millibars and are collected at 150 and 450 cm heights at each of the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET). The earliest hourly calculations were started at PRIMET in 1988 from air temperature and relative humidity sensors located in the 150 cm cotton shelter based on sampling every 15 seconds (in millibars). Please see the following for calculation details: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/dewpt_vpd_calculations.pdf Water vapor pressure deficit is computed from relative humidity and air temperature every 15 second sampling interval and output hourly. Field Methods - MS001: Wind speed and direction Please follow this link to see a general description and history of precipitation measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=wnd & topnav=135 Hourly mean wind speed, resultant mean wind vector magnitude and standard deviation, resultant mean daily wind vector direction, and daily wind direction vector components (Wind Rose) are output at each of the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET). The data logger samples every 15 seconds and the sensor is installed a 10m height. It has been discovered that wind speed from this propeller-style wind anemometers are not accurate below 1 meter per second. Much of this data will be tagged as 'Questionable' or possibly removed. Wind speed and direction is sampled by a RM Young Model 05103 Wind Monitor mounted to the tower. Potentiometer measures direction, anemometer measures wind speed. Data logger is a Campbell Scientific model. Data collected by the Wind Monitor is processed by the Campbell Wind Vector instruction #69 option #2. Historical method: Wind speed was measured with a cup-type anemometer which provides contact closure for every .322 km of air movement. This signal is recorded by an event marker along the border of the same Rustrak strip chart used to record dewpoint. Data logger is Interface Instrument M-2 (1970's) or, Wind speed sensors (R.M. Young #6101 tachometer generators) were mounted on a tower. Data logger is Interface Instrument M-4 (1980's). Temperature and rainfall in the Andrews Experimental Forestare are typical of a maritime climate with wet, relatively mild winters and dry, cool summers. Humidity is generally high through winter months, and maximum daily relative humidity approaches 100 percent at night throughout the year. Minimum summer humidities generally hover around 30-50 percent. Temperature extremes range from near 0 degrees F in unusually cold winters to over 100 degrees for brief periods almost every summer. The range in mean annual temperature (1972-2002) is 7.1-10.5 degrees C at a low elevation site (PRIMET). Precipitation varies with elevation - long-term annual average at low elevation (450 m) is 2200 mm, and at high elevation (1200m) is 2600 mm. Sampling frequency: continuous Much of the early climatological measurements on the Andrews Forest were associated with the investigation of the initial small watersheds experiment (Watersheds 1, 2, 3). The Climatic Station on WS 2 was installed in 1956 to measure precipitation and a hygrothermograph was added in 1958. The High-15 station was established to measure precipitation in 1964 in conjunction with small watersheds 6, 7, 8, and has evolved into a secondary meteorological station. A more general set of modeling needs led to the installation of the Primary Meteorological Station in 1972 to characterize the meso-scale environment. Originally, solar radiation, air temperature, dew point temperature, and windspeed were collected. Along with precipitation from the climatic station on WS 2, these were the primary climatic variables needed for the models predicting the rates at which materials accumulate or move through ecosystems (Waring et al., 1978). Significant improvements to the station were made in 1975, 1979, and 1988, as the station evolved from chart recorders to state-of-the-art digital data loggers (Bierlmaier and McKee, 1989). The Vanilla Leaf Met Station was installed in 1987. The primary intent was to provide micro- meteorological data for a study of seedling survival following clearcut and shelterwood logging at high elevation. Ultimately, the shelterwood site was discontinued and the clearcut site has evolved as a primary high elevation meteorological station. Four Benchmark Meteorological Stations (BMS) and two second-level stations are included in the MS001 database. The Primary Meteorological and Vanilla Leaf Meteorological BMS are retained. Two new BMS are installed. In 1994, the Upper Lookout Meteorological Station was established at high elevation (4200 ft, ENE aspect) on clearcut L708 in the SE Andrews. In 1995 the Central Meteorological BMS was established at a centrally located site on clearcut L351 (3300 ft, WSW aspect) in the east-central Andrews. A GIS analysis of elevation and aspect indicated the average elevation (3170 ft., 966 m) and average aspect (267 degrees) of the Andrews Forest, and the Central Met Station was located to represent these general averages. Modifications are made to the Primary and Vanilla Leaf Stations to standardize measured variables, temporal resolution, methods, and instrumention across all BMS. Sites will be cleared and required openings maintained following standards of the National Weather Service, the LTER network, and where appropriate, the NADP network. Telemetering of all BMS was completed in 1996. Second-level stations (SLS) at the Hi-15 and WS 2 Climatic Station will continue to be maintained for measurement of precipitation, temperature, and other data to maintain continuity of historical records. These sites also follow established procedural standards. The BMS include meteorological measurement of air and soil temperature, relative humidity, calculated dew point temperature and vapor pressure deficit, wind speed and direction measurement, incoming solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil moisture, snow melt, and snow moisture and depth.

Gill radiation shields replaced the PVC shields at all of the benchmark sites after a significant concurrent comparison was made. Aspirated shields are also now in use. The original 1.5 meter Primary Met Station sensor was housed in a Cotton Region Shelter. Historical methods included Rustrak strip charts with thermister where air temperature is measured by a Yellow Springs Instruments linear thermistor in a standard Cotton Region Shelter and continuously recorded on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from -10 degrees C to 40 degrees C. Data loggers are typically Campbell Scientific (CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X). Early data loggers used in the 1980s are Interface Instrument models M-2, M-3, and M-4. Thermocouple wire; Campbell Scientific model 107 temperature probe (CS107B, CS107B-L) includes the Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor; Campbell Model HMP35C or the HMP45C probe containing a Vaisala capacitive relative humidity sensor and a Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor; Campbell Scientific data loggers (CR10, CR21X, CR500, or CR23X); Interface Instrument models M-2, M-3, and M-4 Field Methods - MS001: Dew point temperature Please follow this link to see a general description and history of dew point temperature measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=dew & topnav=135 Dew Point is calculated from air temperature and relative humidity every sampling interval (generally every 15 seconds) and output hourly using Tetens Equation for the relation between temperature and the partial pressure of water vapor (see http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/dewpt_vpd_calculations.pdf). This is calculated for independent pairs of air temperature and relative humidity probes at 150 and 450 cm heights for all benchmark stations (except CS2MET which only has sensors at 150 cm height). Historical methods at PRIMET used a heated lithium-chloride dew point sensor with a thermistor that recorded continuously on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart throughout the 1970s. An Interface Instrument hygrometer with linear thermister was used to measure dew point indirectly with a heated Interface Instrument lithium-chloride hygrometer with a linear thermistor from 1979 until 1988. The PRIMET early dew point sensors and subsequent air temperature and relative humidity sensors used to calculate dew point were located in the 150 cm height cotton shelter until May 2000. The cotton shelter was discontinued for dew point calculation and replaced with use of the 450 cm probe on the PRIMET tower. Early instrumentation at PRIMET in the 1970s included a heated lithium-chloride dew point sensor. The sensor temperature is measured with a thermistor and recorded continuously on a separate 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from -5 degrees C to 20 degrees C with and with an accuracy and resolution of 1 degree C. The Interface Instrument M-2 or M-3 data logger was used. This sensor was often very unreliable. In the 1980s, dew point temperature is measured indirectly by a heated Interface Instrument lithium-chloride hygrometer with a linear thermistor. The accuracy is +/-0.5 degrees C with a resolution of 0.1 degrees C, and range of -14 to 29 degrees C. The Interface Instruments M-4 data logger was used. All other dew point measurements have been calculated from air temperature and relative humidity sensors. Field Methods - MS001: Precipitation Please follow this link to see a general description and history of precipitation measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=ppt & topnav=135 Precipitation records are generally evaluated every 5 minutes and data points are output to capture 5 minute resolution. In actuality, not all of the gauges are designed for accurate recording at this high temporal frequency except during periods of high intensity rain/snowfall. This is generally due to the sensitivity of the magnetostrictive tank gauge and associated tank diameter in measuring fluid level. The 'stand-alone' gauges at UPLMET, VANMET and CENMET are designed for greater sensitivity to changes in tank depth and the 5 minute output is good during most precipitation events. The 'shelter gauges' at those sites are not as sensitive to a change in fluid depth. The tipping bucket gauge at PRIMET reliably outputs tips on a 5 minute basis, although this record is somewhat artificial at 5 minute resolution, especially in light rain situations where the gage does not tip in every 5 minute segment and 15 minute resolution is probably more realistic. Early chart data at CS2MET and the H15MET have been digitized and are generally accurate at 15 minutes resolution. The longest continuous precipitation record on the Andrews is at the Climatic Station on Watershed 2 (CS2MET): 1957-10-01 to Present. Data is collected weekly from a standard US Weather Bureau standard 8” rain gauge and an adjacent Universal recording gauge (chart). The weekly charts were originally hand digitized on a daily basis, and adjusted to the standard gauge total. Subsequently, all charts have been electronically digitized, and data can be reliably output at a 15 minute resolution. This high resolution chart data has also been corrected to the standard gage total on a weekly basis. This Universal rain gauge was originally positioned at another location on the Andrews (at FORKS) and that record can be used to extend the daily CS2MET precipitation record back to December, 1951. A ETI Instruments NOAH IV gauge was installed in 2011 and runs concurrently with the Universal gauge and the standard gauge At the Hi-15 Meteorological Station (H15MET), a standard rain gauge has always been maintained along with an accompanying recording rain gauge. Historically, the charts were hand digitized on a daily basis, and the daily record corrected to the standard gauge periodic total using a prorating technique. Beginning in 1992 a more reliable recording gauge was installed using a pressure transducer to measure fluid depth, and this record is available with no correction to the standard gauge, although the standard gauge is still operational. At both the Upper Lookout (UPLMET) and Central (CENMET) Stations, two gauges are in operation: a stand-alone gauge with two concentric, encircling wind fences, and a second gauge atop the station shelter. The orifice of the stand alone gauge is heated by a thermistatically-controlled propane heater. This heated gauge with the shielding fences has dramatically improved our precipitation catch, particularly in heavy snow conditions, and has prevented snow bridging over the gauge orifice. The shelter gauge is located on top of our station shelter and heated through ducts from the shelter's propane heating system. This gauge has also improved catch over the more traditionally heated rain gauges, but is protected only with an alter wind shield and catches less than the stand-alone. At Vanilla Leaf (VANMET) the original gauge in the clearcut was installed in 1987 but the record is discontinued in 1996. This gauge suffered from its openly exposed siting in this high elevation clearcut. Heavy snow and inadequate wind shielding were major problems. A stand-alone type gauge similar in design to those used at UPLMET and CENMET was installed in the adjacent and naturally sheltered meadow above the VANMET clearcut in 1998. This site takes advantage of the naturally-protected meadow and the wind fences are not employed here. Stand-alone rain gauges with Valdais-type concentric wind fencing are designed for use at remote Andrews locations in heavy snow conditions. The stand-alone gauges are constructed in two sections: 1) a heated orifice section 2) an unheated stand pipe section, and are designed to work with Campbell Scientific data loggers. The two concentric, encircling wind fences are used at CENMET and UPLMET (see design description http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/stand_alone_raingage_design.pdf). Shelter-top rain gauges are currently in use at CENMET, UPLMET, and H15MET. The shelter-top gauge sits on top of a shelter and is heated using ducted shelter heat from the shelter propane heater controlled by the datalogger and thermistor. Continuous precipitation is measured by recorded tank depth measurements (magnetostrictve tank gauges or pressure transducer) in association with Campbell Scientific data loggers. Stevens A-35 chart recorders were used at some sites as a precipitation record backup. Wind Alter shields are typically employed. The Climatic Station at WS#2 (CS2MET) employs a Belfort Universal Recording Rain Gage, Cat No. 5-780 Series. 8' diameter, 12' capacity, and accuracy of .33%. The record is corrected to a nearby 8' US Weather Service Standard Raingage. An ETI Instruments Noah IV gauge was installed in 2011. The Primary Met Station employs a Texas Electronics tipping bucket gauge with 8' diameter orifice with data logger located on a 1 meter high platform with a Campbell Scientific data logger. Field Methods - MS001: Relative humidity Please follow this link to see a general description and history of relative humidity measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=rel & topnav=135 Generally, relative humidity is output hourly and is measured at heights of both 150 and 450 cm at these benchmark stations using Vaisala sensors with Campbell data loggers. Early records at CS2MET employed a hygrothermograph sensor to record daily max-min relative humidity from within a Cotton Region shelter on a recording chart from 1958 to 1998. Standard maximum and minimum thermometers on a Townsend support and a sling psychrometer were used to make weekly corrections to the hygrothermograph chart readings. Temperature and relative humidity are sampled by Campbell Model HMP35C or HMP45C probes containing a Vaisala capacitive relative humidity sensor and a Fenwal Electronics UUT51J1 thermistor. The probes were originally housed in a locally-designed PVC radiation shield, which were later replaced with Gill radiation shields. Campbell Scientific data loggers are used. The original 1.5 meter Primary Met Station sensor was housed in a Cotton Region Shelter. Historical instrumentation include the the Weather Measure Hi-Q hygrothermograph (http://www.novalynx.com/225-5020.html), a precision, self-contained recording instrument that measures and records ambient temperature and relative humidity simultaneously on a double scale chart. A specially treated bundle of human hair is used to measure relative humidity over the full range of 0 to 100%. The hair expands and contracts with increasing or decreasing amounts of water vapor in the air. The chart is installed on a self-contained brass clock which is spring-wound with accuracy of +/- 1%. A Belfort hygrothermograph had been used previously in the late 1950s and 1960s. The Belfort Maximum Minimum Thermometer Cat No. 5-484 indicates the temperature extremes reached over a 24 hour period and is the standard for correcting chart temperature readings. Field Methods - MS001: Snow lysimeter Please follow this link to see a general description and history of snow lysimeter measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=lys & topnav=135 Precipitation and melting snow runoff are measured by a tipping bucket with tips summarized in 5 minute intervals. General installation: The lysmeter collection pan was constructed from 2 x 12s and plywood. The pan was covered with hyplon (white vinyl polymer), and a bathtub drain installed in one corner. The pan was installed on the ground surface and was leveled such that the collected water would flow to the corner with the drain. The water is then directed to a tipping bucket (TB) in the basement of the structure by pvc pipe which is buried to prevent freezing. The final deminsions of the lysimeter pan are 92' x 93' x 12', so a volume of water equal to .01' of ppt is 1.4032 L. The Campbell data logger records the Tipping Bucket snow lysimeter tips (.01' of ppt/snowmelt input). An electromagnetic counter acts as a check to recorded tips. Sensors are connected to the data logger through a Campbell wiring panel. Field Methods - MS001: Snow moisture and depth Please follow this link to see a general description and history of snow water equivalence (moisture) and snow depth measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=sno & topnav=135 Snow water equivalence (SWE) and snow depth are measured every 5 minutes. Due to high variability in readings, particularly of snow depth, values may only be posted every hour for some data. Snow moisture is measured with a Park Mechanical pressure pillow and Druck pressure transducer. Snow depth is measured with a Campbell Scientific model SR50 sonic ranging snow depth sensor or Judd communications snow depth sensor. The snow depth sensor takes up to 10 readings, performs error checking and outputs a reading in mm every 5 minutes. Depth sensor measurement range is 0.5 to 10 meters. The snow sensor is mounted on a long pipe extending from the shelter. The snow pillow readings are instantaneous at 5 minute intervals. Campbell Scientific data logger is used. Snow moisture and snow depth are merged in the output files. Snow moisture is measured with a Park Mechanical pressure pillow and Druck pressure trandsducer. Snow depth is measured with a Campbell Scientific model SR50 sonic ranging snow depth sensor or Judd communications snow depth sensor. Campbell Scientific data loggers are used. Field Methods - MS001: Snow course Snow moisture and snow depth are measured with snow cores at 5 points across a transect (see entity 20). This station snow course (transect) is near the station and tries to follow a single contour. The average of these 5 points provides a check of the snow pillow and snow depth sensor. Snow depth is also measured at each corner of the station snow pillow using a permanently set graduated stake (pvc pipe). The average depth is converted to snow water equivalence using the density calculated from the station snow course. Mt Rose snow core sampler Field Methods - MS001: Soil moisture Please follow this link to see a general description and history of soil moisture measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=smo & topnav=135 Soil moisture is measured with a water content reflectometer (WCR) beginning in 1998 replacing older gypsum block technology. Values are output on a daily basis at four depths (10, 20, 50, 100 cm) from the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) Campbell Scientific CS615 Water Content Reflectometers Field Methods - MS001: Soil moisture potential Please follow this link to see a general description and history of soil moisture potential measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=smp & topnav=135 Gypsum blocks were used to record mean daily soil moisture potential at the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) beginning in 1994. Water content reflectometers were added beginning in 1998 at all sites and all gypsum block measurements were terminated by May 2000. Hourly measurements were made between 1988 and 1990 at PRIMET but were discontinued and restarted in Oct 1994 on a daily basis only. At VANMET, soil moisture potential measurements were summarized by daytime and nighttime hours only from 1987 to 1994 at depths of 10, 20, 30 cm.

Thermocouple wire was used in the earliest measurements and were protected inside of a PVC structure. Most measurements begin in 1994 but measurements were made at PRIMET beginning in 1988 at 20 cm depth only. At VANMET, measurements were summarized by daytime and nighttime hours only from 1987 to 1993 at depths of 10, 20, 30 cm, and soil temperature was recorded in the rooting zone of 3 individual trees.

Maximum solar radiation is based on instantaneous micromoles per second per square meter, and the time of the maximum value is accurate to the minute. It is common for solar radiation sensors to read negative at night (-1 to -7), and negative nighttime readings are changed to 0. The daily values average in these negative values, creating a minor error in the daily values. LICOR PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) quantum sensor, Campbell Scientific model LI190SB. The output of the PAR sensor is a daily average, daily maximum and 15 minute averages, and the units are in micromoles/sec/meter<superscript>2</superscript>. Field Methods - MS001: Solar radiation Please follow this link to see a general description and history of solar radiation measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=sol & topnav=135 Total incoming solar radiation is recorded at the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET) and output every 15 minutes starting in 1994. This total incoming solar radiation data is also output every day in megaJoule per m2 along with the maximum daily rate of incoming solar radiation in watts per m2 and the time of the maximum accurate to the minute. Solar radiation measurement began in 1972 at PRIMET, but much of the incoming solar radiation data from the 1970's is estimated. Values are output on an hourly basis until 1994 at PRIMET. Data had originally been output as langleys but has been converted to more standard units. Kipp and Zonnen solar radiation pyranometer with thermopile type sensor, model CM-6B with Campbell Scientific data logger located on a 1 meter high platform at Primary Met and on top of shelters at other stations. An earlier model used was the CM-5 with an Instrument Interface M4 data logger. Historical method: The signal is recorded continuously from the Lintronic dome solarimeter on a 30-day Rustrak strip chart scaled from 0 to 2.0 cal/cm<superscript>2</superscript>/min with a resolution of 0.1 cal/cm<superscript>2</superscript>/min. Data loggers used were the Interface Instrument M-2 or M-3. This historical solar sensor was often unreliable. Field Methods - MS001: Watervapor pressure deficit Please follow this link to see a general description and history of water vapor pressure deficit measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=vpd & topnav=135 Vapor pressure deficit values are calculated and output hourly from air temperature and relative humidity probes that sample every 15 seconds. Values are output in millibars and are collected at 150 and 450 cm heights at each of the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET). The earliest hourly calculations were started at PRIMET in 1988 from air temperature and relative humidity sensors located in the 150 cm cotton shelter based on sampling every 15 seconds (in millibars). Please see the following for calculation details: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/dewpt_vpd_calculations.pdf Water vapor pressure deficit is computed from relative humidity and air temperature every 15 second sampling interval and output hourly. Field Methods - MS001: Wind speed and direction Please follow this link to see a general description and history of precipitation measurements for these stations: http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/lter/data/studies/ms01/meta/template.cfm?page=wnd & topnav=135 Hourly mean wind speed, resultant mean wind vector magnitude and standard deviation, resultant mean daily wind vector direction, and daily wind direction vector components (Wind Rose) are output at each of the four benchmark stations (PRIMET, CENMET, UPLMET, VANMET). The data logger samples every 15 seconds and the sensor is installed a 10m height. It has been discovered that wind speed from this propeller-style wind anemometers are not accurate below 1 meter per second. Much of this data will be tagged as 'Questionable' or possibly removed. Wind speed and direction is sampled by a RM Young Model 05103 Wind Monitor mounted to the tower. Potentiometer measures direction, anemometer measures wind speed. Data logger is a Campbell Scientific model. Data collected by the Wind Monitor is processed by the Campbell Wind Vector instruction #69 option #2. Historical method: Wind speed was measured with a cup-type anemometer which provides contact closure for every .322 km of air movement. This signal is recorded by an event marker along the border of the same Rustrak strip chart used to record dewpoint. Data logger is Interface Instrument M-2 (1970's) or, Wind speed sensors (R.M. Young #6101 tachometer generators) were mounted on a tower. Data logger is Interface Instrument M-4 (1980's). Temperature and rainfall in the Andrews Experimental Forestare are typical of a maritime climate with wet, relatively mild winters and dry, cool summers. Humidity is generally high through winter months, and maximum daily relative humidity approaches 100 percent at night throughout the year. Minimum summer humidities generally hover around 30-50 percent. Temperature extremes range from near 0 degrees F in unusually cold winters to over 100 degrees for brief periods almost every summer. The range in mean annual temperature (1972-2002) is 7.1-10.5 degrees C at a low elevation site (PRIMET). Precipitation varies with elevation - long-term annual average at low elevation (450 m) is 2200 mm, and at high elevation (1200m) is 2600 mm. Sampling frequency: continuous Much of the early climatological measurements on the Andrews Forest were associated with the investigation of the initial small watersheds experiment (Watersheds 1, 2, 3). The Climatic Station on WS 2 was installed in 1956 to measure precipitation and a hygrothermograph was added in 1958. The High-15 station was established to measure precipitation in 1964 in conjunction with small watersheds 6, 7, 8, and has evolved into a secondary meteorological station. A more general set of modeling needs led to the installation of the Primary Meteorological Station in 1972 to characterize the meso-scale environment. Originally, solar radiation, air temperature, dew point temperature, and windspeed were collected. Along with precipitation from the climatic station on WS 2, these were the primary climatic variables needed for the models predicting the rates at which materials accumulate or move through ecosystems (Waring et al., 1978). Significant improvements to the station were made in 1975, 1979, and 1988, as the station evolved from chart recorders to state-of-the-art digital data loggers (Bierlmaier and McKee, 1989). The Vanilla Leaf Met Station was installed in 1987. The primary intent was to provide micro- meteorological data for a study of seedling survival following clearcut and shelterwood logging at high elevation. Ultimately, the shelterwood site was discontinued and the clearcut site has evolved as a primary high elevation meteorological station. Four Benchmark Meteorological Stations (BMS) and two second-level stations are included in the MS001 database. The Primary Meteorological and Vanilla Leaf Meteorological BMS are retained. Two new BMS are installed. In 1994, the Upper Lookout Meteorological Station was established at high elevation (4200 ft, ENE aspect) on clearcut L708 in the SE Andrews. In 1995 the Central Meteorological BMS was established at a centrally located site on clearcut L351 (3300 ft, WSW aspect) in the east-central Andrews. A GIS analysis of elevation and aspect indicated the average elevation (3170 ft., 966 m) and average aspect (267 degrees) of the Andrews Forest, and the Central Met Station was located to represent these general averages. Modifications are made to the Primary and Vanilla Leaf Stations to standardize measured variables, temporal resolution, methods, and instrumention across all BMS. Sites will be cleared and required openings maintained following standards of the National Weather Service, the LTER network, and where appropriate, the NADP network. Telemetering of all BMS was completed in 1996. Second-level stations (SLS) at the Hi-15 and WS 2 Climatic Station will continue to be maintained for measurement of precipitation, temperature, and other data to maintain continuity of historical records. These sites also follow established procedural standards. The BMS include meteorological measurement of air and soil temperature, relative humidity, calculated dew point temperature and vapor pressure deficit, wind speed and direction measurement, incoming solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil moisture, snow melt, and snow moisture and depth.

Andrews Experimental Forest; PO Box 300 Blue River OR 97413 541-822-6336 mark.schulze@oregonstate.edu Principal Investigator The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics. Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources. Data were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest research program, funded by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 08-23380), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and Oregon State University. National Science Foundation: DEB0823380 The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms."

The stand-alone gauges are constructed in two sections: 1) a heated orifice section 2) an unheated stand pipe section, and are designed to work with Campbell Scientific data loggers. The two concentric, encircling wind fences are used at CENMET and UPLMET (see design description http://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/data/studies/ms01/stand_alone_raingage_design.pdf). Shelter-top rain gauges are currently in use at CENMET, UPLMET, and H15MET. The shelter-top gauge sits on top of a shelter and is heated using ducted shelter heat from the shelter propane heater controlled by the datalogger and thermistor. Continuous precipitation is measured by recorded tank depth measurements (magnetostrictve tank gauges or pressure transducer) in association with Campbell Scientific data loggers. Stevens A-35 chart recorders were used at some sites as a precipitation record backup. Wind Alter shields are typically employed.

Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources. Data were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest research program, funded by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 08-23380), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and Oregon State University. National Science Foundation: DEB0823380 The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms."

00003-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Urban growth models have increasingly been used by planners and policy makers to visualize, organize, understand, and predict urban growth. However, these models reveal a wide disparity in their attention to policy factors. Some urban growth models capture few if any specific policy effects (e.g.,as model variables), while others integrate certain policies but not others. Since zoning policies are the most widely used form of land use control in the United States, their conspicuous absence from so many urban growth models is surprising. This research investigated the impacts of zoning on urban growth by calibrating and simulating a cellular automaton urban growth model, SLEUTH, under two conditions in a South Florida location. The first condition integrated restrictive agricultural zoning into SLEUTH, while the other ignored zoning data. Goodness of fit metrics indicate that including the agricultural zoning data improved model performance. The results further suggest that agricultural zoning has been somewhat successful in retarding urban growth in South Florida. Ignoring zoning information is detrimental to SLEUTH performance in particular, and urban growth modeling in general."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

00004-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Site Selection: In the fall of 2005, three sites were selected that varied primarily in deciduous shrub abundance, hereafter referred to as low, medium and high shrub sites. Sites were chosen to have similar state factors (climate, relief, parent material, and time) but varied in the abundance of deciduous shrubs (Jenny, 1994). The sites represent a natural gradient of increasing shrub abundance because the same species of deciduous shrubs (Betula nana, and Salix pulchra) are found at all three sites (except S. richardsonii, which is found only at the medium shrub site); however, their percent cover increases from 15 to 94 %. Our sites are within 1 km of each other, and have similar parent material, and time since last glaciation (Itkillik I, deglaciated ca. 60 000 yr), and regional climate, although microclimates vary across sites due to differences in slope and aspect. The low shrub site is located on top of gently rolling hills, while the medium and high shrub sites are located in depressions along water tracks of ephemeral streams fed by spring snowmelt. Our low shrub abundance site is located in moist acidic tussock tundra where the vegetation consists of approximately equal biomass of graminoids (Eriophorum vaginatum and Carex bigelowii), dwarf deciduous shrubs (B. nana, Vaccinium uliginosum, and S. pulchra), evergreen shrubs (Ledum palustre ssp. decumbens and V. vitis-idea), and mosses (Hylocomium splendens, Aulacomnium turgidum, Dicranum spp., and Sphagnum spp.) (Shaver and Chapin, 1991). In our medium shrub abundance site, vegetation consists of graminoids (primarily C. bigelowii), deciduous shrubs (B. nana, V. uliginosum, S. pulchra and S. richardsonii), and mosses (H. splendens and Dicranum spp.). Our high shrub abundance site has predominantly deciduous shrubs (B. nana, S. pulchra, and some Potentilla fruticosa) with some evergreen or wintergreen shrubs (V. vitis-idaea and Linnaea borealis), forbs (Polygonum bistorta, Petasites frigidus, Stellaria longipes, Valeriana capitata, and Artemisia alaskana), graminoids (Poa arctica, C. bigelowii, and Calamagrostis canadensis), and mosses (Sphagnum spp. and H. splendens). Snow Manipulation: To manipulate snow depth, snow fences (1.5 m high and 62 m long) were set up in the fall of 2005 at the low and medium sites to manipulate snow depth. For the high site, the patchy nature of the shrub stands made it necessary to set up two separate snow fences (1.5 m high and 32 m long) in patches with similar shrub composition and density. Our purpose for adding snow was to simulate the amount of snow that might be trapped by deciduous shrubs; therefore, the height of the snow fences was selected to match the maximum shrub height within the region. Fences were oriented E-W, and snow drifts accumulated on the northern side of the fences. Two treatments (control=ambient snow and drift=manipulated snow) were set up at each site. The drift plots were set up 4 m from the fence on the northern side of the fence, because this was the zone of maximum snow accumulation. At the low and medium sites, the control plots were set up on the southern (non-drift) side of the fence, 10 m from the fence at the low site, and 7 m from the fence at the medium site. These buffer zones were left to prevent the control from being exposed to snow trapped by the fence. At the high shrub sites, control plots were located in line with one of the fences, beginning 5 m from its end, and in 3 discontinuous blocks of tall shrubs to the south (control side) of the fence, beginning approximately 15 m from the fence. This arrangement was chosen because the cover of tall shrubs was discontinuous on the southern (control) side of the fences. For all sites, plots on the drift side of the fences were located in the zone of maximum snow accumulation, which was relatively uniform. Within each treatment, 18 2 by 10 m plots, with 1 m buffer strips between, were established. For this study, six plots per treatment (n=6) were randomly assigned to measure N mineralization and nitrification. Remaining plots were used for additional experiments. Snow addition effects on litter decomposition (common substrate experiment): To directly test the effect of microclimate and snow addition on litter decomposition rates we incubated the senesced leaves from a common substrate, B. neoalaskana (Sarg.), in the ambient and snow manipulated plots across all three sites. Senesced leaves were collected from trees growing near Fairbanks, AK. Leaves were still attached to the trees but the petiole had already started to abscise. This common substrate was used because the large leaf size and relative abundance allowed us to collect enough material for our study. Leaves were air dried, well mixed, and then subsampled for litter bags. One gram of leaves was sewn into 2 mm mesh bags, 8 x 8-cm in size. Litter bags were incubated beneath the live moss and litter layer starting in early June of 2006. The moss and litter in this system are well mixed so bags were inserted in this layer. Four identical bags were strung together for four separate annual harvests. Bags were placed in six treatment plots in each site (n=6), with three sub-replicates within each plot. Bags were removed in July of 2007, 2008, and 2009 and were kept frozen until they could be processed. At time of processing, bags were thawed and then gently rinsed with deionized (DI) water to remove soil and loose litter attached to the outside of the bag. All original leaf litter was removed, dried at 45° C for a minimum of 48 hours and weighed. To determine the percent C and N of the litter, samples were ground to a fine powder on a Wiley-mill, with a #40 mesh screen, and then analyzed using an ECS 4010 elemental analyzer (Costech Analytical, Valencia, California, USA). Percent of initial mass remaining was calculated by dividing the incubated mass by the initial mass and multiplying by 100. Percent of initial C (ICR) and initial N remaining (INR) was calculated by the following equation: ??????=((??_(1 ????????) × ??_(1 ????????????) ))/((??_(0 ????????) × ??_(0 ????????????)))× 100 Initial litter quality effects on litter decomposition (common garden experiment): To compare differences in litter decomposition rates among species, we incubated senesced leaf litter from 13 species and stem litter from four shrub species collected across seven sites located in the arctic foothills region on the North Slope of Brooks Range, Alaska, USA. Three of the sites were the control plots at the low, medium, and high shrub sites. Four sites were dominated by alder shrubs (Alnus crispa)-two near the Sagavanirktok River and two along the Dalton Highway ~ 32 km north of Toolik Field Station. Alders are one of the deciduous shrubs that have been documented as expanding in many arctic regions so we chose to include litter from these shrubs as well. All litter was collected and processed using the same method as described previously in the common substrate experiment except that only 1.6 mm mesh bags, 4 x 8-cm in area, were used and leaf samples were replicated six times while stem litter was replicated three times. Litter bags were installed in early June of 2006 and replicate bags were removed in July of 2007, 2008, and 2009. In addition, we incubated leaf litter collected from seven different species growing in three long-term fertilization experiments to better understand the influence of litter quality on litter decomposition rates. All three sites, “Historic” (Chapin et al. 1995, Mack et al. 2004), “LTER” (Bret-Harte et al. 2001), and “Species Removal” (Bret-Harte et al. 2008) are located in moist acidic tundra and were fertilized annually with both 10 g of N and 5 g of P m-2 year-1 for 20, 14, and five years, respectively. Litter from these bags were installed in the field in July of 2003, removed in July of 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2008, and processed as described above. Calculations. The exponential decay constant, k, was determined by assuming a single exponential decay model (Olson 1963): Mt = Moe-kt, where Mt = litter mass at time t, and MO = initial mass. The slope of the regression of proportion of initial mass remaining against time was used to determine decay constant for each substrate at each site. Initial Litter Quality. A subsample of each leaf and stem collections was analyzed for percent C, percent N, and C quality to determine the quality of the litter substrates prior to decomposition. Percent C and N was determined on samples that had been ground to a fine powder on a Wiley-mill, with a #40 mesh screen, and then analyzed using an ECS 4010 elemental analyzer. C quality measurements were carried out on an ANKOM fiber analyzer (Ankom Technology, Macedon, N. Y.) and included determination of (1) soluble cell contents (carbohydrates, lipids, pectin, starch, and soluble protein), (2) hemicelluloses plus bound proteins, (3) cellulose, and (4) lignin plus other recalcitrants (Ryan et al. 1990).

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

00007-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In contribution to the Arctic Observing Network (AON), the researchers have established two observatories of landscape-level carbon, water and energy balances at Imnaviat Creek, Alaska and at Pleistocene Park near Cherskii, Russia. These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system. In support of these objectives, a 3m eddy covariance station was established on Imnaviat Creek, Alaska. This station has been continuoulsy monitoring carbon dioxide, water vapor, energy fluxes and various micrometeorological variables."

00007-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 datalogger and a loptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Mircrometeorlogical data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all datapoints are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the datalogger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis. The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data: 1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range. 2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceed a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered. 3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (ie. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.) 5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Dataloggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'. 6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers. 7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered. The following procedures are used to gap-till the data: 1) A P-th order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (ie. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

00007-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 datalogger and a loptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Mircrometeorlogical data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all datapoints are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the datalogger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis. The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data: 1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range. 2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceed a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered. 3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (ie. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.) 5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Dataloggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'. 6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers. 7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered. The following procedures are used to gap-till the data: 1) A P-th order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (ie. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system.

00009-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project addresses the following questions: 1) Does ecosystem warming cause a net release of C from the ecosystem to the atmosphere?, 2) Does the decomposition of old C, that comprises the bulk of the soil C pool, influence ecosystem C loss?, and 3) How do winter and summer warming alone, and in combination, affect ecosystem C exchange? We are answering these questions using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure ecosystem carbon balance and radiocarbon isotope ratios at a warming experiment located in an upland tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. This dataset contains static chamber measurements of CO2 flux at CiPEHR during the falls of 2009,2011, 2012, and 2013."

While permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding, depending on local topography, this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands. The CiPEHR experiments were established in 2008 to complement research along a natural permafrost thaw gradient, at an adjacent site. At the permafrost-thaw gradient site permafrost temperature has been monitored annually in a 30-m-deep borehole since1985, before the permafrost started to thaw. There are two experimental warming treatments at the CiPEHR project: Soil warming (previously referred to as winter warming: WW) increases soil temperature and ground thaw using snow fences; Air warming (previously referred to as summer warming: SW) increases growing season air temperature using open top chambers. The warming treatments are applied in a blocked split-plot design to evaluate the seperate and combined effects of winter and summer warming. Methods A clear chamber (~140 L, 0.36 m^2) was placed on the plot base and air was circulated between the chamber and an Li-820 infra-red gas analyzer at 1L/min. Air inside the chamber was also mixed with two small fans. The plot bases (12cm tall) are permanently installed ~7cm into the soil. During sampling, the CO2 concentration was recorded every 1 second for 2 minutes. Ecosystem respiration measurements were measured in the same way except during daytime hours a dark tarp was placed over the chamber. Each plot was sampled twice: once for ecosystem respiration and once for NEE. The soil temperature was measured with permanently installed thermo-couples. PAR inside the chamber was recorded with a Li-Cor quantum sensor and hand-held Li-1400.

00011-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Climate warming in polar regions is associated with thawing of permafrost, resulting in significant changes in soil hydrology, biogeochemical cycling, and in the activity and composition of soil communities. While ongoing, directional climate warming can elicit such responses over decadal time scales, their manifestation typically occurs as discrete thawing pulses. Indeed, in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica abrupt changes in community structure and biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems following a summer warming event (Jan. 2002) exceeded the influences of a decadal cooling trend in both magnitude and rate of response. Thus, we anticipate that climate-mediated permafrost changes and their associated impacts on soil communities and biogeochemical cycles may occur over seasonal time scales. Our objective is to simulate different frequencies of permafrost thawing events in Antarctic permafrost soils. Since the top horizons of most Antarctic soils are dry permafrost (i.e., there is insufficient water content to generate ice-cement), with ice-cement or massive ice typically below 30 cm, permafrost thawing events are likely to result in subsurface movements of water that may manifest as groundwater seeps down gradient."

00011-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We designed a long-term water diversion experiment introducing two frequencies of water additions from a natural pond to trenches excavated to the depth of ice-cement. In Dec. 2011 we established three sets of permanent plots (7.5 X 15m) on the south-facing hillslope above Many Glaciers Pond in Taylor Valley. High-resolution LIDAR imaging, instrumentation, and comprehensive pre-treatment sampling of all plots was conducted in Dec. of 2011, and in Jan. 2013, prior to an additional round of pre-treatment sampling and then initiation of the experiment anticipated in Jan. 2014. Instrumentation consists of thermocouples, delta-T moisture probes and water activity probes buried at multiple active-layer depths every 2 m down-gradient from the water-addition trenches. The three different plots will receive the following different treatments: PRESS Treatment (H): Annual water additions sufficient to raise soil water to 10% water content (as observed during the melt event in Jan. 2002). This is achieved by pumping water from Many Glaciers Pond to a holding tank above the experimental plots, from which we will apply water by gravity feed to a trench during the warmest week of the year (typically the 1st or 2nd week of Jan.). PULSE Treatment (L): Same as above, but water diversions added only in alternate years to simulate a lower frequency of thawing permafrost Positive Control (C): Trenched and instrumented, but no water additions Sampling campaigns consist of 84 soil samples (28 per treatment) collected from permanent plots for quantification of soil biota (invertebrates determined by microscopy and bacteria by 16S rRNA sequencing) and intensive geochemical analyses. This experiment will address the overarching hypothesis: Climate warming in the McMurdo Dry Valleys will amplify connectivity among landscape units leading to enhanced coupling of nutrient cycles across landscapes, and increased biodiversity and productivity. Soil samples were taken for organism enumeration and moisture content analysis as follows: Sampling bags were prepared with one sterile Whirlpak bag and clean plastic scoop per sample. Samples were taken from within the 1m2 area of each plot. The location of the sampling was recorded each year so that areas were not re-sampled. Using the plastic scoop, soil was collected to 10 cm depth. Very large rocks (more than 20 mm diameter) were excluded from the sample. The soil was shoveled into the Whirlpak bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +4C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum soil can, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105C for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil. The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed. Cold tap water was added up to 650 mL. The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or figure of 8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula. Immediately the liquid was poured into wet screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh. The screens were rinsed gently with ice cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the stack, keeping the screens at an angle as the water filtered through. The water was kept on ice at all times. The top screen was removed, and the lower screen rinsed top down, never directly on top of the soil, but at the top of the screen and from behind. The water was allowed to cascade down and carry the particles into the bottom wedge of the angled screen. The side of the screen was tapped gently to filter all the water through. The suspension was rinsed from the front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to overflow the edge of the screen. The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and rinsing the funnel gently. The suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 1744 RPM. The liquid was decanted, leaving a few mL on top of the soil particles. The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g sucrose per liter of tap water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL. This was stirred gently with a spatula until the pellet was broken up and suspended. The suspension was centrifuged for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube. Samples were refrigerated at 4C until counted. Samples were washed in to a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x10 or x20 magnification. Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted. Nematodes were identified to species and sex, and counted. Total numbers in each sample were recorded on data sheets. All species of nematode, and all rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample were recorded. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil. All procedures were carried out in the dark or very low irradiance to avoid degradation of the chlorophyll. The soil samples were mixed thoroughly in the vials, and a sample of approximately 5 g was weighed out in to a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a screw-top cap. 10 mL of a 50:50 DMSO/90percent acetone solution was added to each sample and they were mixed thoroughly on a bench-top Vortex mixer for about 5 seconds. The vials were placed in a -4C constant temperature room, in the dark, and left for 12-18 hours. Determination of chlorophyll a concentration. This was determined fluorometrically using a Turner model 111 fluorometer. A calibration using a known concentration of chlorophyll was carried out prior to sample analysis. The machine was blanked using a 50:50 DMSO/90percent acetone solution. Each vial was mixed thoroughly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 1800 RPM. A sample of approximately 4mL of the DMSO/acetone solution was taken from the top of the sample with a pipette, being careful not to get any soil particles in the solution. The sample was placed in a cuvette, in to the fluorometer and the fluorescence was recorded. This was done fairly quickly in order to prevent light from breaking down the chlorophyll. This measurement is called Fo, the initial fluorescence. After taking this reading, 0.1 mL of 1N HCl was added directly to the cuvette and the cuvette was gently agitated. After 20 seconds, the fluorescence was re-measured. (During this step, the acid converts the chlorophyll to phaeophytin by releasing a magnesium ion in an acidic environment). This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after acidification. The solution was discarded in to a waste container, and the cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90percent acetone solution before proceeding with the next sample. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. For measurements of pH, 40 of DI water was added to 20g of soil in a clean, DI- rinsed glass beaker (coarse fragments greater than 2 mm were removed). The samples were stirred until thoroughly mixed (about 5-10 sec). After sitting to equilibrate for 10 minutes the samples were stirred again and a reading was taken with a Beckman 0265 pH meter. For measurements of electrical conductivity, an additional 60 ml of DI water was then added (totaling 100 ml water). The samples were stirred until thoroughly mixed (about 5-10 sec). After sitting to equilibrate for 10 minutes the samples were stirred again and a reading was taken with a YSI 30 conductivity meter."

The soil was shoveled into the Whirlpak bag until three quarters full (about 1.5 kg soil). The soil was mixed well in the bag, then the bag was closed tightly, expelling as much air as possible. The soil samples were stored in a cooler for transportation. On return to the laboratory (within 8 hours of sampling), the soils were stored at +4C until further processing. In the laboratory, soil samples were handled in a laminar flow hood to prevent contamination. The Whirlpak bags of soil were mixed thoroughly prior to opening. A sub-sample of approximately 50g was removed and placed in a pre-weighed aluminum soil can, and weighed on a balance accurate to 0.01g. This sample was dried at 105C for 24 hours. The sample was removed, placed in a desiccator to cool down, and re-weighed. These data were used to calculate water content of the soil. The remaining soil in the plastic beaker was weighed. Cold tap water was added up to 650 mL. The soil suspension was stirred carefully (star stir or figure of 8) for 30 seconds, using a spatula. Immediately the liquid was poured into wet screens - a stack of 40 mesh on top of a 400 mesh. The screens were rinsed gently with ice cold tap water (from a wash bottle) through the top of the stack, keeping the screens at an angle as the water filtered through. The water was kept on ice at all times. The top screen was removed, and the lower screen rinsed top down, never directly on top of the soil, but at the top of the screen and from behind. The water was allowed to cascade down and carry the particles into the bottom wedge of the angled screen. The side of the screen was tapped gently to filter all the water through. The suspension was rinsed from the front and the back, keeping the screen at an angle and not allowing the water to overflow the edge of the screen. The soil particles were backwashed into a 50mL plastic centrifuge tube, tipping the screen into the funnel above the tube and rinsing the funnel gently. The suspension was centrifuged for five minutes at 1744 RPM. The liquid was decanted, leaving a few mL on top of the soil particles. The tube was filled with sucrose solution (454g sucrose per liter of tap water, kept refrigerated) up to 45mL. This was stirred gently with a spatula until the pellet was broken up and suspended. The suspension was centrifuged for one minute at 1744 RPM, decanted into a wet 500 mesh screen, rinsed well with ice cold tap water and backwashed into a centrifuge tube. Samples were refrigerated at 4C until counted. Samples were washed in to a counting dish and examined under a microscope at x10 or x20 magnification. Rotifers and tardigrades were identified and counted. Nematodes were identified to species and sex, and counted. Total numbers in each sample were recorded on data sheets. All species of nematode, and all rotifers and tardigrades found in the sample were recorded. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. Extraction of chlorophyll from the soil. All procedures were carried out in the dark or very low irradiance to avoid degradation of the chlorophyll. The soil samples were mixed thoroughly in the vials, and a sample of approximately 5 g was weighed out in to a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube with a screw-top cap. 10 mL of a 50:50 DMSO/90percent acetone solution was added to each sample and they were mixed thoroughly on a bench-top Vortex mixer for about 5 seconds. The vials were placed in a -4C constant temperature room, in the dark, and left for 12-18 hours. Determination of chlorophyll a concentration. This was determined fluorometrically using a Turner model 111 fluorometer. A calibration using a known concentration of chlorophyll was carried out prior to sample analysis. The machine was blanked using a 50:50 DMSO/90percent acetone solution. Each vial was mixed thoroughly, then centrifuged for 5 minutes at about 1800 RPM. A sample of approximately 4mL of the DMSO/acetone solution was taken from the top of the sample with a pipette, being careful not to get any soil particles in the solution. The sample was placed in a cuvette, in to the fluorometer and the fluorescence was recorded. This was done fairly quickly in order to prevent light from breaking down the chlorophyll. This measurement is called Fo, the initial fluorescence. After taking this reading, 0.1 mL of 1N HCl was added directly to the cuvette and the cuvette was gently agitated. After 20 seconds, the fluorescence was re-measured. (During this step, the acid converts the chlorophyll to phaeophytin by releasing a magnesium ion in an acidic environment). This measurement is called Fa, the fluorescence after acidification. The solution was discarded in to a waste container, and the cuvette rinsed 3 times with DMSO/90percent acetone solution before proceeding with the next sample. Data were entered in to Excel files, printed, and checked for errors. For measurements of pH, 40 of DI water was added to 20g of soil in a clean, DI- rinsed glass beaker (coarse fragments greater than 2 mm were removed). The samples were stirred until thoroughly mixed (about 5-10 sec). After sitting to equilibrate for 10 minutes the samples were stirred again and a reading was taken with a Beckman 0265 pH meter. For measurements of electrical conductivity, an additional 60 ml of DI water was then added (totaling 100 ml water). The samples were stirred until thoroughly mixed (about 5-10 sec). After sitting to equilibrate for 10 minutes the samples were stirred again and a reading was taken with a YSI 30 conductivity meter."

00012-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"These data are a time series of canopy biomass of the giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera, derived from LANDSAT 5 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. The kelp canopy is composed of the portions of fronds floating on the surface of the water. Biomass data (wet weight, kg) are given for individual 30 x 30 meter pixels in the coastal areas extending from near Pt. Reyes, California, to Punta Abreojos, Baja California Sur, Mexico, including the Northern and Southern Channel Islands. Data were derived from Landsat 5 TM images. Observations are made on a 16 day reqeat cycle but the temporal coverage is irregular because of cloud cover and instrument failure. Estimates of kelp canopy biomass are derived from the relationship between satellite surface reflectance and empirical measurements of kelp canopy biomass in long-term SBC LTER study plots obtained using SCUBA. Data are organized into yearly files, and zipped to compress. In its entirety this dataset is large, more than 3 GB and 80 million lines. To receive an archive of all data, or for assistance with subsets (e.g., range of dates or a latitude/longitude) contact sbclter@msi.ucsb.edu."

As in many temperate regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs. Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.

00013-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"In 1980-1982, six transplant gardens were established along a latitudinal gradient in interior Alaska from Eagle Creek, AK, in the south to Prudhoe Bay, AK, in the north (Shaver et al. 1986) .Three sites, Toolik Lake (TL), Sagwon (SAG), and Prudhoe Bay (PB) are north of the continental divide and the remaining three, Eagle Creek (EC), No Name Creek (NN), and Coldfoot (CF), are south of the continental divide. Each garden consisted of 10 individual tussocks transplanted back to their home-site, as well as 10 individuals from each of the other transplant sites (n = 10; 6 populations x 6 sites x 10 replicates = 360 total individuals). All gardens were censused in 2010. For a haphazardly chosen subsample of tillers ( n = 12) on each tussock, the total number of green leaves was counted and the length of the two longest leaves was measured from the top of the sheath. There were some tussocks with fewer than 12 tillers, in which case we measured all those alive. Old leaves that were initiated the previous year were identified by a dark band with dead tissue above it, whereas new leaves had no such band. A tiller size index was calculated by multiplying the length of the longest leaf by the total number of green leaves (usually 2, 3 or 4). This tiller index is highly correlated with tiller mass (Shaver, Fetcher &amp;amp; Chapin 1986).

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades.

At each site, a shrub-dominant and tussock-tundra habitat was chosen for sampling, for a total of 8 sampling locations. At each sampling location, a 100-meter transect was established. Arthropods were sampled along the transect weekly by passing a sweepnet through and over the vegetation. After killing the arthropods with pest strips and freezing, they were sorted from the associated leaf litter and counted. Dry biomass of the arthorpods was estimated in one of two was: using family-level identification, digital microscope measurement, and published allometric length-mass equations; or, arthropds were weighed directly on a microbalance following 48 hours in a drying oven at 50°C."

00014-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"In the summers of 2010-2014, aboveground arthropod abundance and biomass was measured weekly at four sites near Toolik Field Station, Alaska. At each site, a 10,000 m2 shrub-tundra and tussock-tundra plot were designated for sampling. An iron rod was driven into the ground near the center of each plot, serving as a center point for 100-m transect. Transect direction was re-determined weekly by spinning a small linear object. Samples were taken at ten points, spaced ten-meters apart, along each transect. A sample consisted of ten back-and-forth passes of a standard 14' canvas sweepnet through and/or over the vegetation, with each pass of the sweepnet spaced one meter apart. Samples were transferred to plastic bags, and arthropods were killed using pest strips. In the lab samples were placed in the freezer for 4-6 hours. Arthropods were then sorted from the leaf litter and counted. Biomass was estimated in one of two ways. In the first 'allometric' method, arthorpods were measured individually using a digital microscope camera, identified to family, and familly-specific length-mass allometric equations from the published literature were applied to estimate biomass. Otherwise, arthropods were dried for 48 hours at 50°C and then 'weighted directly' on a microbalance. For additional site and method descriptions see: Shannan K. Sweet, Ashley Asmus, Mathew E.

00014-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"In the summers of 2010-2014, aboveground arthropod abundance and biomass was measured weekly at four sites near Toolik Field Station, Alaska. At each site, a 10,000 m2 shrub-tundra and tussock-tundra plot were designated for sampling. An iron rod was driven into the ground near the center of each plot, serving as a center point for 100-m transect. Transect direction was re-determined weekly by spinning a small linear object. Samples were taken at ten points, spaced ten-meters apart, along each transect. A sample consisted of ten back-and-forth passes of a standard 14' canvas sweepnet through and/or over the vegetation, with each pass of the sweepnet spaced one meter apart. Samples were transferred to plastic bags, and arthropods were killed using pest strips. In the lab samples were placed in the freezer for 4-6 hours. Arthropods were then sorted from the leaf litter and counted. Biomass was estimated in one of two ways. In the first 'allometric' method, arthorpods were measured individually using a digital microscope camera, identified to family, and familly-specific length-mass allometric equations from the published literature were applied to estimate biomass. Otherwise, arthropods were dried for 48 hours at 50°C and then 'weighted directly' on a microbalance. For additional site and method descriptions see: Shannan K. Sweet, Ashley Asmus, Mathew E.

This included six flight lines flown for the examination of water spectral properties for the Satilla River, Altamaha River, and Sapelo Sound. Imagery was acquired for 97 bands from 435-950 nm at a 1 m spatial resolution. The bandwidths were preselected by investigators with CALMIT to to capture the photoplankton red reflectance feature and carotenoid and chlorophyll driven absorption behaviors. These data were acquired for the following purposes: 1) calculate suites of remote sensing phytoplankton indices, (2) produce algorithms for predicting plant and phytoplankton chlorophyll and accessory pigments and productivity, 3) assess water quality, and (4) perform atmospheric corrections."

00016-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In contribution to the Arctic Observing Network (AON), the researchers have established two observatories of landscape-level carbon, water and energy balances at Imnaviat Creek, Alaska and at Pleistocene Park near Cherskii, Russia. These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. In support of these objectives, a new 32m tower was deployed in Pleistocene Park, about 20km south of NESS. This station is currently measuring fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor and energy in addition to other meteorological variables."

00016-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Similar to the other flux stations involved in the AON project, the Pleistocene Park Station generates two types of data: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

00016-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Similar to the other flux stations involved in the AON project, the Pleistocene Park Station generates two types of data: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system.

00017-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Oysters are ecosystem engineers in marine ecosystems, but the functions of oyster shell deposits in intertidal salt marshes are not well understood. The annual plant Suaeda linearis is associated with oyster shell deposits in Georgia salt marshes. We hypothesized that oyster shell deposits promoted the distribution of Suaeda linearis by engineering soil conditions unfavorable to dominant salt marsh plants of the region (the shrub Borrichia frutescens, the rush Juncus roemerianus and the grass Spartina alterniflora). We tested this hypothesis using common garden pot experiments and field transplant experiments. Suaeda linearis thrived in Borrichia frutescens stands in the absence of neighbors, but was suppressed by Borrichia frutescens in the with-neighbor treatment, suggesting that Suaeda linearis was excluded from Borrichia frutescens stands by interspecific competition. Suaeda linearis plants all died in Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora stands, indicating that Suaeda linearis is excluded from these habitats by physical stress (likely water-logging). In contrast, Borrichia frutescens, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina alterniflora all performed poorly in Suaeda linearis stands regardless of neighbor treatments, probably due to physical stresses such as low soil water content and low organic matter content. Thus, oyster shell deposits play an important ecosystem engineering role in influencing salt marsh plant communities by providing a unique niche for Suaeda linearis, which otherwise would be rare or absent in salt marshes in the southeastern US. Since the success of Suaeda linearis is linked to the success of oysters, efforts to protect and restore oyster reefs may also benefit salt marsh plant communities."

00017-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Aboveground Biomass of Target Species - Garden Pot At the end of growing season (October 2008 for the common garden pot experiment I, and October 2009 for the common garden pot experiment II), all aboveground live plant material was harvested and dried for 3 days at 60 degrees C and weighed. Drying oven; manufacturer: Fisher Scientific (model: 750G) Aboveground Biomass of Target Species - Transplant At the end of the growing season (October 2009), all aboveground live plant material was harvested, dried for 3 days at 60 degrees C and weighed. Drying oven; manufacturer: Fisher Scientific (model: 750G) Oyster Shell Content - Field Survey We collected soil samples from stands of Suaeda at 20 separate locations. For comparison, we also took soil samples respectively from stands of Borrichia (n = 10 locations), Juncus (n = 10 locations) and Spartina (n = 10 locations) that were adjacent to Suaeda stands. Discrete stands of Suaeda were identified from a distance of ~50 m (at this distance we could not see whether soils had a high shell content or not). At each location, we collected soil samples (0-10 cm depth) at 3-5 spots from within a stand, and combined them into a mixed soil sample of ~4L in volume. For each soil sample, we took a subsemple of ~3.95L and separated the subsample into oyster shell versus sand and clay using a sieve (mesh size 5.6 mm). The very few gravel and rock pieces found were included with the sand/clay fraction. We calculated oyster shell content in the soil using the formula: oyster shell content = oyster shell dry mass (g)/soil total dry mass (g). Soil Organic Matter Content - Field Transplant In July 2009, we collected soil samples of ~50g from 0-10 cm depth from 8 spots (8 samples) from each of the 2 vegetation zones at each site (in total 48 samples = 8 samples x 2 zones x 3 sites). We dried the soil samples in the lab for 16h at 110 °C, and grinded the samples into powder. We took a subsample (~15g) from each soil sample and determined the weight of each subsample, and placed the subsamples in a cold muffle furnace and raise the temperature to 400°C. We heated the subsamples for 16 h, and determined the weight of each subsample again. We calculated soil organic content (%) using the formula: soil organic matter content = 1-weight after combustion (g)/ weight before combustion (g). Muffle furnace Soil pH - Field Transplant Soil smaples were collected in July, August and September 2009 respectively. At each time, we collected soil samples of 50 ml in volume from 0-10 cm depth from 8 spots (8 samples) from each of the 2 vegetation zones at each site (in total 144 samples = 8 samples x 2 zones x 3 sites x 3 times). Soil pH was measured by rehydrating dried soils with distilled water in a 1:1 soil:water mixture (by volume), and measuring the pH of the supernatant with a pH meter. Soil Porewater Salinity - Field Transplant Soil smaples were collected in July, August and September 2009 respectively. At each time, we collected ~50g soil samples from 0-10 cm depth from 8 spots (8 samples) from each of the 2 vegetation zones at each site (in total 144 samples = 8 samples x 2 zones x 3 sites x 3 times). Soil porewater salinity was measured by rehydrating dried soils in a known volume of distilled water, measuring the salinity of the supernatant, and back-calculating to the original porewater volume. Refractometer; manufacturer: Vista (model: A355ATC); parameter: Salinity (accuracy: 1 PSU, readability: 1 PSU, range: 0-100 PSU) Volumetric Soil Water Content - Common Garden Pot We measured the volumetric water content of media in each pot at the end of growing season (October 2008 for the common garden pot experiment I, and October 2009 for the common garden pot experiment II) at ~8 hours after the last watering. We collected soil sample of 50 ml in volume from 0-10 cm depth for each pot of different media. We measured the wet weight of each soil sample, and dried the soil samples for 3 days at 60 degrees C, then weighed them again to determine water volume, assuming 1g/ml as the water density. We calculated the volumetric soil water content using the formula: volumetric soil water content = water volume (ml)/total soil volume (ml). Drying oven; manufacturer: Fisher Scientific (model: 750G) Volumetric Soil Water Content - Field Transplant Soil smaples were collected in July, August and September 2009 respectively. At each time, we collected soil samples of 50 ml in volume from 0-10 cm depth from 8 spots (8 samples) from each of the 2 vegetation zones at each site (in total 144 samples = 8 samples x 2 zones x 3 sites x 3 times). We measured the wet weight of each soil sample, and dried the soil samples for 3 days at 60 degrees C, then weighed them again to determine water volume, assuming 1g/ml as the water density.

Drying oven; manufacturer: Fisher Scientific (model: 750G) 2008-06-01 2009-10-31 GCE Study Site Sapelo -- Sapelo Island, Sapelo Island, Georgia. Sapelo Island on the Southeast Georgia Coast -81.307978 -81.176185 31.536369 31.380150 Common Garden Pot Experiment Fieldwork was conducted at salt marshes near Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA (31° 27´N, 81° 16´W). In these salt marshes, Borrichia frutescens and Juncus roemerianus occur in monospecific or mixed stands at higher marsh elevations, and Spartina alterniflora at lower marsh elevations (Wiegert and Freeman 1990; Pennings and Moore 2001). Suaeda linearis occurs in discrete stands at high marsh elevations adjacent to Borrichia frutescens or Juncus roemerianus, and at low marsh elevations adjacent to large tidal creeks and channels (all plants will be referred to generically hereafter). | Common Garden Pot Experiment 1 (CGPE I) was carried out between June 2008 and October 2008. Common Garden Pot Experiment 2 (CGPE II) was carried out between June 2009 and October 2009. CGPE I - We grew Suaeda, Borrichia and Juncus alone (1 plant per pot) and in the combinations of Suaeda + Borrichia and Suaeda + Juncus (1 plant of each species per pot) in 20-L (29 cm wide × 35 cm high) pots. Pots were filled with 3 media treatments: 1) high marsh soil collected from a single high marsh, 2) oyster shell collected from a single tidal channel bank and 3) a mixture of 50% (volume) soil (from high marsh) and 50% (volume) shell (n = 10 replicates per species combination per media treatment). For each species, healthy individual plants (seedlings for Suaeda) within a narrow range of size were collected from a single site in June 2008. The roots of each plant were carefully separated from the original soil and rinsed with fresh water before potting. Pots assigned to without-neighbor treatments were placed apart from each other by ~0.5 m to ensure minimal shading from plants in adjacent pots, whereas pots with same combination of plants in with-neighbor treatments were placed close to each other to simulate an extensive mixed stand as best as possible given a pot experiment. | CGPE II: In this experiment, we grew Suaeda and Spartina alone and together with 3 media treatments which were low marsh soil, shell and a mixture of 50% (volume) soil (from the low marsh) and 50% (volume) shell (n = 10 replicates per species combination per media treatment). Both experiments ran from June to October. Plants were maintained outside (exposed to rain) and watered evenly with fresh water (1L per pot) on non-rainy days. The pots received full sun during the middle of the day and partial shade from trees and a building in the early morning and late afternoon. At the end of growing season (October), aboveground biomass of all plants was harvested and dried for 3 days at 60 degrees C and weighed. We measured the volumetric water content of media in each pot at the end of growing season by drying soils (~8 hours after watering) as described above. Field Survey Fieldwork was conducted at salt marshes near Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA (31° 27´N, 81° 16´W). In these salt marshes, Borrichia frutescens and Juncus roemerianus occur in monospecific or mixed stands at higher marsh elevations, and Spartina alterniflora at lower marsh elevations (Wiegert and Freeman 1990; Pennings and Moore 2001). Suaeda linearis occurs in discrete stands at high marsh elevations adjacent to Borrichia frutescens or Juncus roemerianus, and at low marsh elevations adjacent to large tidal creeks and channels (all plants will be referred to generically hereafter). To document the association between Suaeda and oyster shell deposits, we took soil samples from stands of Suaeda at 20 separate locations. For comparison, we also took soil samples respectively from stands of Borrichia (n = 10 locations), Juncus (n = 10 locations) and Spartina (n = 10 locations) that were adjacent to Suaeda stands. Discrete stands of Suaeda were identified from a distance of ~50 m (at this distance we could not see whether soils had a high shell content or not). At each location, we collected soil samples (0-10 cm depth) at 3-5 spots from within a stand, and combined them into a mixed soil sample of ~4L in volume. We measured the wet weight of a subsample (50 ml volume) of each soil sample, and dried the subsamples for 3 days at 60 degrees C, then weighed them again to determine water volume, assuming 1g/ml as the water density. We calculated the volumetric soil water content using the formula: volumetric soil water content = water volume (ml)/total soil volume (ml). We separated the rest of each soil sample into oyster shell versus sand and clay using a sieve (mesh size 5.6 mm). The very few gravel and rock pieces found were included with the sand/clay fraction. We calculated oyster shell content in the soil using the formula: oyster shell content = oyster shell dry mass (g)/soil total dry mass (g). Field Transplant Experiments Fieldwork was conducted at salt marshes near Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA (31° 27´N, 81° 16´W). In these salt marshes, Borrichia frutescens and Juncus roemerianus occur in monospecific or mixed stands at higher marsh elevations, and Spartina alterniflora at lower marsh elevations (Wiegert and Freeman 1990; Pennings and Moore 2001). Suaeda linearis occurs in discrete stands at high marsh elevations adjacent to Borrichia frutescens or Juncus roemerianus, and at low marsh elevations adjacent to large tidal creeks and channels (all plants will be referred to generically hereafter). | We located 3 representative sites where Suaeda occurred associated with oyster shell deposits adjacent to stands of Borrichia, Juncus or Spartina. Henceforth we refer to these sites as the Borrichia-Suaeda site, Juncus-Suaeda site and Spartina-Suaeda site. The Borrichia-Suaeda site was at the terrestrial border of a high marsh and only experienced occasional tidal flooding during spring tides with relatively short duration; the Juncus-Suaeda site was in the high marsh, and experienced irregular tidal flooding that was most prolonged during spring-tides; the Spartina-Suaeda site was at low marsh elevations, and experienced daily tidal flooding. In each vegetation zone of each site, we established 8 removal plots (1.5 × 1.5 m) with background vegetation removed, and 8 control plots with background vegetation left intact that were interspersed with the removal plots, for a total of 32 plots per site (2 vegetation zones × 2 neighbor treatments × 8 replicates). The removal plots were created by clipping background vegetation at the soil surface in March 2009, and maintained by monthly weeding. At each site, healthy Suaeda seedlings and individuals of the paired species (Borrichia, Juncus or Spartina), with associated soil blocks (10×10×10 cm), were collected and transplanted into each plot in each vegetation zone. Because some soil was transplanted along with perennial plants, this experiment was conservative with respect to the effect of habitat on the performance of the perennials. For each species, individuals collected were within a narrow size range. The 2 individuals (of Suaeda and the other paired species) in each plot were placed ~1m apart from each other within the plot to minimize any interactions between them (their canopies never overlapped). At the end of the growing season (October 2009), all aboveground live plant material was harvested, dried for 3 days at 60 degrees C and weighed. Soil water content (volumetric), porewater salinity and pH were measured in July, August and September 2009. Soil organic matter content was determined in July 2009 by combustion method.

Drying oven; manufacturer: Fisher Scientific (model: 750G) Aboveground Biomass of Target Species - Transplant At the end of the growing season (October 2009), all aboveground live plant material was harvested, dried for 3 days at 60 degrees C and weighed. Drying oven; manufacturer: Fisher Scientific (model: 750G) Oyster Shell Content - Field Survey We collected soil samples from stands of Suaeda at 20 separate locations. For comparison, we also took soil samples respectively from stands of Borrichia (n = 10 locations), Juncus (n = 10 locations) and Spartina (n = 10 locations) that were adjacent to Suaeda stands. Discrete stands of Suaeda were identified from a distance of ~50 m (at this distance we could not see whether soils had a high shell content or not). At each location, we collected soil samples (0-10 cm depth) at 3-5 spots from within a stand, and combined them into a mixed soil sample of ~4L in volume. For each soil sample, we took a subsemple of ~3.95L and separated the subsample into oyster shell versus sand and clay using a sieve (mesh size 5.6 mm). The very few gravel and rock pieces found were included with the sand/clay fraction. We calculated oyster shell content in the soil using the formula: oyster shell content = oyster shell dry mass (g)/soil total dry mass (g). Soil Organic Matter Content - Field Transplant In July 2009, we collected soil samples of ~50g from 0-10 cm depth from 8 spots (8 samples) from each of the 2 vegetation zones at each site (in total 48 samples = 8 samples x 2 zones x 3 sites). We dried the soil samples in the lab for 16h at 110 °C, and grinded the samples into powder. We took a subsample (~15g) from each soil sample and determined the weight of each subsample, and placed the subsamples in a cold muffle furnace and raise the temperature to 400°C. We heated the subsamples for 16 h, and determined the weight of each subsample again. We calculated soil organic content (%) using the formula: soil organic matter content = 1-weight after combustion (g)/ weight before combustion (g). Muffle furnace Soil pH - Field Transplant Soil smaples were collected in July, August and September 2009 respectively. At each time, we collected soil samples of 50 ml in volume from 0-10 cm depth from 8 spots (8 samples) from each of the 2 vegetation zones at each site (in total 144 samples = 8 samples x 2 zones x 3 sites x 3 times). Soil pH was measured by rehydrating dried soils with distilled water in a 1:1 soil:water mixture (by volume), and measuring the pH of the supernatant with a pH meter. Soil Porewater Salinity - Field Transplant Soil smaples were collected in July, August and September 2009 respectively. At each time, we collected ~50g soil samples from 0-10 cm depth from 8 spots (8 samples) from each of the 2 vegetation zones at each site (in total 144 samples = 8 samples x 2 zones x 3 sites x 3 times). Soil porewater salinity was measured by rehydrating dried soils in a known volume of distilled water, measuring the salinity of the supernatant, and back-calculating to the original porewater volume.

Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER program, located on the central Georgia coast, was established in 2000. The study domain encompasses three adjacent sounds (Altamaha, Doboy, Sapelo) and includes upland (mainland, barrier islands, marsh hammocks), intertidal (fresh, brackish and salt marsh) and submerged (river, estuary, continental shelf) habitats. Patterns and processes in this complex landscape vary spatially within and between sites, and temporally on multiple scales (tidal, diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Overlain on this spatial and temporal variation are long-term trends caused by climate change, sea level rise, and human alterations of the landscape. These long-term trends are likely to manifest in many ways, including changes in water quality, river discharge, runoff and tidal inundation patterns throughout the estuarine landscape. The overarching goal of the GCE program is to understand the mechanisms by which variation in the quality, source and amount of both fresh and salt water create temporal and spatial variability in estuarine habitats and processes, in order to predict directional changes that will occur in response to long-term shifts in estuarine salinity patterns. The objectives of the current funding cycle are 1) to continue to document long-term patterns of environmental forcing to the coastal zone, 2) to link environmental forcing to observed spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical processes, primary production, community dynamics, decomposition and disturbance, 3) to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which environmental gradients along the longitudinal (freshwater-saltwater) and 4) lateral (upland-subtidal) axes of estuaries drive ecosystem change, and 5) to explore the relative importance of larval transport and the conditions of the adult environment in determining community and genetic structure across both the longitudinal and vertical gradients of the estuary. To meet these objectives, we utilize a suite of approaches including long-term monitoring of abiotic drivers and ecosystem responses; manipulative and natural experiments designed to enable us to examine the importance of key ecosystem drivers; and modeling.

00019-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The purpose of this study was to determine the geologic/ sedimentologic history of the marsh near Mary Hammock, a marsh island in McIntosh County, GA. During the Summer of 2009, a vibracore machine was used to extract six sediment cores (MT01 through MT06) from the marsh north of Mary Hammock. In addition, tree stumps buried under the marsh were recorded, and one was extracted and analyzed, to facilitate in understanding the sedimentological history of the marsh. A GPS unit was used to record the precise locations and elevations of the core extraction sites and stumps. The cores were then transported to the Georgia Southern Coastal Research Lab at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), in Savannah, GA, for analysis. The tree stump was brought back to the University of Georgia for analysis. Although there was a large degree of bioturbation in the marsh near Mary Hammock, sediment core analysis (visual inspection, X-Ray analysis, particle size analysis, and analysis of organic matter content), and stump analysis (species determination and radiocarbon dating), revealed three main facies in the marsh. The topmost layer is recent marsh. The middle layer is a sandy layer, representing the former upland surface prior to sea level rise, inundation, and marsh formation (around 5,000 to 4,000 years ago). The bottom layer is a highly compact greenish-gray clay layer. The conclusion is that the former upland surface, consisting mostly of sandy soils, was inundated due to sea level rise around 4,200 B.P. Marsh sedimentation occurred after this, depositing fine-grained sediments on top of the sandy surface (Turck and Alexander, 2013)."

00019-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Extraction of Sediment Cores A vibracore machine was used to extract six sediment cores (MT01 through MT06) from the marsh near Mary Hammock. A Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) was used to record the precise locations and elevations of the core extraction sites. A bucket auger with a 12.7 cm (5 in) diameter and 17.8 cm (7 in.) length was used to remove the first 18-36 cm of marsh in the location to be cored. A tripod was set up over the hole, and aluminum core pipe (irrigation tubing), at 3.1 m (10 ft) in length and 7.6 cm (3 in) in diameter, was placed within the tripod. The end of the vibracoring mechanism was clamped near the top of the core pipe. While holding the pipe steady, and pushing down on it, the vibracoring motor was turned on, and the core pipe was eased into the ground. When the core pipe could not be pushed any further, the vibracore machine was turned off, and the clamp removed. Measurements of the core pipe were taken, and then extracted using a come-along. One end was attached to the tripod, and the other end was attached to straps tied tightly around the core. Once out, a cap was placed on the bottom of the core, extra pipe at the top was cut off using a hacksaw, and another cap was placed on top of the core. The caps were clearly marked as to the location of the core, as well as which end was top and bottom. Cores were then cut into 1.5-meter sections, for ease of transport. Again, caps labeled top or bottom were placed on the ends, and then a sharpie was used to label the different core sections. Backpack Concrete Vibrator; manufacturer: Oztec Insustries, Inc.

The core pipes were cut open with a circular saw, and a wire was pulled through the middle of the sediment sample, splitting the core sample into two sections. Core samples were then visually inspected and described, noting how color, texture, inclusions, etc. changed down core. Both halves of each core were then photographed with a digital camera. Since it took several images (between 7 and 9) to capture the whole core, the images were mosaiced together in Photoshop, creating one seamless image for each core. One half of each core was wrapped in plastic wrap, put into a plastic “D-tube” with a damp sponge, and put into refrigerated storage at SkIO. The other core halves, (which will be referred to hereafter as “working halves”), were then analyzed. Circular saw, wire, digital camera, 'D-tube' X-Ray Analysis of Cores Each working half was X-rayed to find discrete layers and sedimentary structures not visible to the naked eye (see Butler 1992). A VR 1020 portable X-Ray machine was set up in a trailer about 90 cm above the floor. Film was placed on the floor underneath the X-Ray machine, and the top section of the working half of the core was placed on top of that. From a safe distance, the film for each section of core was exposed to X-Rays between 18 and 22 seconds, at a tube voltage of 60kV and current of 20mA. X-Ray machine; manufacturer: Medison Acoma Co. Ltd. (model: VR1020) VR 1020 portable X-Ray machine Particle Size Analysis Sediment samples were then taken at arbitrary 10-cm intervals from cores MT01, MT03, and MT06. Particle size analysis was performed by dry sieving the larger grains, and using the pipette method for smaller grains (after Galehouse 1971; also see Folk 1980; Loveland and Whalley 2001). For each sample, the large fraction (i.e., sand, or anything bigger or equal to 63 microns) was separated from the small fraction (i.e., silt and clay, or anything smaller than 63 microns). The large fraction was then put through stacked sieves and weighed to the nearest ten-thousandth of a gram, revealing the amount of sand in the sample. The small fraction was put in a graduated cylinder with 1,000 ml of deionized water, shaken, and then 20 ml were sampled twice using a pipette. The first sample, extracted near the bottom of the cylinder directly after it has been shaken, was used to determine the weight of silt and clay in the entire graduated cylinder. After a specified length of time had passed, the second sample of 20 ml was taken, with the pipette only 5 cm down. This determined the weight of clay. This was then subtracted from the previous calculation to get the amount of silt. Sieves of Clark Alexander at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography Analysis of Organic Matter Content This analysis was performed by the Georgia Cooperative Extension, Soil, Plant, and Water Laboratory, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, at the University of Georgia. Organic matter and total carbon (all the carbon in the sample, including both inorganic and organic carbon) were determined by the Loss on Ignition (LOI) method, and are expressed as percent by weight (Kissel and Sonon 2008:20). Samples were combusted in an oxygen atmosphere at 1350ºC, which converts elemental carbon into CO2. This gas is then passed through infrared cells to determine the carbon content (Kissel and Sonon 2008:20). Oven of the Georgia Cooperative Extension, Soil, Plant, and Water Laboratory, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of Georgia Recording of Tree Stumps The last piece of evidence to help determine the sedimentological history of the area was the recording of drowned tree stumps. These were noticed at low tide, eroding out of the creek banks to the north of Mary Hammock, near where the cores were extracted. The position of one stump (Stump 1) was recorded using a Garmin GPS. The more precise vertical and horizontal position of a second stump (Stump 2) was also recorded. Stump 2 was found eroding out of the creek bank, buried under the marsh. The RTK-GPS unit was used to record the marsh above Stump 2, and measurements were taken to determine the position of the stump in relation to that point. Several characteristics of Stump 2 and the surrounding stratigraphy were noted at this time. First, the stump was vertical, so there is a good chance that this was the position the tree was in when it died. Second, the roots of Stump 2 were recorded to estimate where the ground surface was when the tree was alive. Third, the positions of sedimentary structures were noted in the creek bank profile, and their depths were recorded in relation to Stump 2. The former land surface when the stump was alive was determined to be around 127-132 cm below the present-day marsh surface (or, between 65 and 60 cm above present-day Mean Lower Low Water). Stump 2 was removed, and brought back to the University of Georgia for further analysis. A section was cut off and brough to Laurie Schimleck, of the Forestry department at UGA. Using a micrscope, he determined that the stump was most likely a pine. Another section was cut off, a sample was removed from one of the inner rings, and it was brought to the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at UGA for radiocarbon dating.

A vibracore machine was used to extract six sediment cores (MT01 through MT06) from the marsh. In addition, tree stumps buried under the marsh were recorded, and one was extracted and analyzed, to facilitate in understanding the sedimentological history of the marsh. GPS units were used to record the precise locations and elevations of the core extraction sites and stumps. The cores were then transported to the Georgia Southern Coastal Research Lab at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), in Savannah, GA, for analysis. The tree stump was brought back to the University of Georgia for analysis. The sediment cores were analysed by visual inspection, X-Ray analysis, particle size analysis, and analysis of organic matter content. The tree stump was analysed by species determination and radiocarbon dating. Sediment samples were analyzed by John Turck for particle size and organic matter content. These samples were obtained from the cores that were extracted in the marsh, as well as from the site where the stump was extracted. Six sediment cores were extracted from the marsh with a vibracore machine. The average spacing of the cores was around 75m, and the lengths of sediment core samples were between 1 and 3 meters. Three of those cores were sub-sampled at 10 cm intervals. A tree stump from under the marsh was also extracted from the marsh by hand and shovel. The cores were sub-sampled at 10 cm intervals, removing two sets of sediment samples at each interval. One sediment sample for particle size analysis was taken from the former ground surface that the tree stump was sitting on. GEL-GCES-1402.kml"

00019-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Extraction of Sediment Cores A vibracore machine was used to extract six sediment cores (MT01 through MT06) from the marsh near Mary Hammock. A Real-Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS) was used to record the precise locations and elevations of the core extraction sites. A bucket auger with a 12.7 cm (5 in) diameter and 17.8 cm (7 in.) length was used to remove the first 18-36 cm of marsh in the location to be cored. A tripod was set up over the hole, and aluminum core pipe (irrigation tubing), at 3.1 m (10 ft) in length and 7.6 cm (3 in) in diameter, was placed within the tripod. The end of the vibracoring mechanism was clamped near the top of the core pipe. While holding the pipe steady, and pushing down on it, the vibracoring motor was turned on, and the core pipe was eased into the ground. When the core pipe could not be pushed any further, the vibracore machine was turned off, and the clamp removed. Measurements of the core pipe were taken, and then extracted using a come-along. One end was attached to the tripod, and the other end was attached to straps tied tightly around the core. Once out, a cap was placed on the bottom of the core, extra pipe at the top was cut off using a hacksaw, and another cap was placed on top of the core. The caps were clearly marked as to the location of the core, as well as which end was top and bottom. Cores were then cut into 1.5-meter sections, for ease of transport. Again, caps labeled top or bottom were placed on the ends, and then a sharpie was used to label the different core sections. Backpack Concrete Vibrator; manufacturer: Oztec Insustries, Inc.

The core pipes were cut open with a circular saw, and a wire was pulled through the middle of the sediment sample, splitting the core sample into two sections. Core samples were then visually inspected and described, noting how color, texture, inclusions, etc. changed down core. Both halves of each core were then photographed with a digital camera. Since it took several images (between 7 and 9) to capture the whole core, the images were mosaiced together in Photoshop, creating one seamless image for each core. One half of each core was wrapped in plastic wrap, put into a plastic “D-tube” with a damp sponge, and put into refrigerated storage at SkIO. The other core halves, (which will be referred to hereafter as “working halves”), were then analyzed. Circular saw, wire, digital camera, 'D-tube' X-Ray Analysis of Cores Each working half was X-rayed to find discrete layers and sedimentary structures not visible to the naked eye (see Butler 1992). A VR 1020 portable X-Ray machine was set up in a trailer about 90 cm above the floor. Film was placed on the floor underneath the X-Ray machine, and the top section of the working half of the core was placed on top of that. From a safe distance, the film for each section of core was exposed to X-Rays between 18 and 22 seconds, at a tube voltage of 60kV and current of 20mA. X-Ray machine; manufacturer: Medison Acoma Co. Ltd. (model: VR1020) VR 1020 portable X-Ray machine Particle Size Analysis Sediment samples were then taken at arbitrary 10-cm intervals from cores MT01, MT03, and MT06. Particle size analysis was performed by dry sieving the larger grains, and using the pipette method for smaller grains (after Galehouse 1971; also see Folk 1980; Loveland and Whalley 2001). For each sample, the large fraction (i.e., sand, or anything bigger or equal to 63 microns) was separated from the small fraction (i.e., silt and clay, or anything smaller than 63 microns). The large fraction was then put through stacked sieves and weighed to the nearest ten-thousandth of a gram, revealing the amount of sand in the sample. The small fraction was put in a graduated cylinder with 1,000 ml of deionized water, shaken, and then 20 ml were sampled twice using a pipette. The first sample, extracted near the bottom of the cylinder directly after it has been shaken, was used to determine the weight of silt and clay in the entire graduated cylinder. After a specified length of time had passed, the second sample of 20 ml was taken, with the pipette only 5 cm down. This determined the weight of clay. This was then subtracted from the previous calculation to get the amount of silt. Sieves of Clark Alexander at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography Analysis of Organic Matter Content This analysis was performed by the Georgia Cooperative Extension, Soil, Plant, and Water Laboratory, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, at the University of Georgia. Organic matter and total carbon (all the carbon in the sample, including both inorganic and organic carbon) were determined by the Loss on Ignition (LOI) method, and are expressed as percent by weight (Kissel and Sonon 2008:20). Samples were combusted in an oxygen atmosphere at 1350ºC, which converts elemental carbon into CO2. This gas is then passed through infrared cells to determine the carbon content (Kissel and Sonon 2008:20). Oven of the Georgia Cooperative Extension, Soil, Plant, and Water Laboratory, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of Georgia Recording of Tree Stumps The last piece of evidence to help determine the sedimentological history of the area was the recording of drowned tree stumps. These were noticed at low tide, eroding out of the creek banks to the north of Mary Hammock, near where the cores were extracted. The position of one stump (Stump 1) was recorded using a Garmin GPS. The more precise vertical and horizontal position of a second stump (Stump 2) was also recorded. Stump 2 was found eroding out of the creek bank, buried under the marsh. The RTK-GPS unit was used to record the marsh above Stump 2, and measurements were taken to determine the position of the stump in relation to that point. Several characteristics of Stump 2 and the surrounding stratigraphy were noted at this time. First, the stump was vertical, so there is a good chance that this was the position the tree was in when it died. Second, the roots of Stump 2 were recorded to estimate where the ground surface was when the tree was alive. Third, the positions of sedimentary structures were noted in the creek bank profile, and their depths were recorded in relation to Stump 2. The former land surface when the stump was alive was determined to be around 127-132 cm below the present-day marsh surface (or, between 65 and 60 cm above present-day Mean Lower Low Water). Stump 2 was removed, and brought back to the University of Georgia for further analysis. A section was cut off and brough to Laurie Schimleck, of the Forestry department at UGA. Using a micrscope, he determined that the stump was most likely a pine. Another section was cut off, a sample was removed from one of the inner rings, and it was brought to the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at UGA for radiocarbon dating.

A vibracore machine was used to extract six sediment cores (MT01 through MT06) from the marsh. In addition, tree stumps buried under the marsh were recorded, and one was extracted and analyzed, to facilitate in understanding the sedimentological history of the marsh. GPS units were used to record the precise locations and elevations of the core extraction sites and stumps. The cores were then transported to the Georgia Southern Coastal Research Lab at the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO), in Savannah, GA, for analysis. The tree stump was brought back to the University of Georgia for analysis. The sediment cores were analysed by visual inspection, X-Ray analysis, particle size analysis, and analysis of organic matter content. The tree stump was analysed by species determination and radiocarbon dating. Sediment samples were analyzed by John Turck for particle size and organic matter content. These samples were obtained from the cores that were extracted in the marsh, as well as from the site where the stump was extracted. Six sediment cores were extracted from the marsh with a vibracore machine. The average spacing of the cores was around 75m, and the lengths of sediment core samples were between 1 and 3 meters. Three of those cores were sub-sampled at 10 cm intervals. A tree stump from under the marsh was also extracted from the marsh by hand and shovel.

In many years, temperature and stream height were recorded manually each day. In recent years, dataloggers have measured stream temperature and stream height at regular intervals. A rating curve was developed to calculate continuous discharge from stage height. Temperature was also measured on an hourly basis. Stage height was measured on the Kuparuk about 1 km above the Dalton Highway crossing."

00021-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This drying and warming experiment addresses the following questions: 1) Does ecosystem drying, warming and permafrost thaw cause a net release or uptake of C from the ecosystem to the atmosphere?, 2) Does the decomposition of old C that comprises the bulk of the soil C pool influence ecosystem C loss? 3) How do drying and warmign affect plant communities and ecosystem properties? We are answering these questions using a combined warming and drying experiment (DryPEHR), which is situated with the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project and located in an upland tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. Warming treatment here refers to growing season air temperature warming (~1C) using open top chambers (OTC) combined with soil 'warming' using snow fences during the snow covered months. Drying is achieve using an automated pumping system that lowers the water table in the dry plots. Soil warming began in 2008; OTCs and drying in 2011. This dataset contains point measurements of winter ecosystem respiration fluxes using the on-plot method and the soil temperature, air temperature, and snow depth associated with each flux."

Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope at this site in a 30-m-deep borehole that was installed in 1985. Warming treatment here refers to growing season air temperature warming using open top chambers (OTC) combined with soil insulation using snow fences during the snow covered months. Drying is achieved using an automated pumping system that lowers the water table in the dry plots. Soil warming began in 2008; OTCs and drying in 2011. In late September 2012, 24 PVC chambers (10 cm diameter, 0.86 L average volume) were installed 10 cm into the soil of the experimental plots and remained in place for the entire winter. [Note: chambers were installed in the area affected by the automated pumping system but NOT by the OTCs. The chambers that were under the influence of experimental warming were in the SOIL insulation part of the experiment.] Each chamber was placed close (within 1m) to a soil temperature and soil moisture probe. An open piece of tubing was installed next to the chambers to measure ambient CO2 under the snowpack. To eliminate disturbance of the snowpack, this tubing, along with tubing from the chambers, extended to an off-plot location. Methods During sampling, the CO2 concentration in the snowpack directly next to the chamber was determined using a Li-820 infrared gas analyzer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA; hereafter referred to as IRGA). The CO2 concentration within the chamber was then measured and scrubbed down to the ambient snowpack concentration using soda lime, at which point flux measurement began. Air was circulated between the chamber and the IRGA at 1L min-1 and the CO2 concentration was recorded every 2 seconds for 15 minutes. All chamber measurements were performed in low wind (< 8 mps) conditions. geoReference 2012-10-27 2013-05-15 Sampling Frequency Irregular: sampled when personnel was at field site and when field conditions allowed."

In short, the first and second derivatives of the CO2 concentration vs. time curve were determined using a brute force method. To obtain the first derivative, we analyzed a moving window of 120 points. A time zero (T0), the first derivative was the slope of the line through all points from T0 to T120. At T1, the first derivative was the slope of the linethrough all points from T1 to T121 and so on. To obtain the second derivative, we used the same method but with a 300 second window, as applying a shorter window made the curve too rough for analysis. After we obtained the second derivatives, we recorded the flux (the first derivative, slope of initial curve in ppm/s) at the point where the second derivative leveled off near zero. We then used pv=nrt to convert from ppm/(s*m^2) to umolesCO2/(m^2*s). Status Ongoing"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

These will form part of a network of observatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interaction with the global system.In support of these objectives, a 3m eddy covariance station was established on a low ridge adjacent to Imnavait Creek, Alaska. This station has been continuously monitoring carbon dioxide, water vapor, energy fluxes and various micrometeorological variables."

00023-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected.This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

00023-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected.This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system.

00025-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The influence of density-dependent and number-dependent processes on individual demographic rates often results in ecological tradeoffs. Because such processes have important implications for individual level fitness and population regulation, they long have been an important topic in ecological research. I used Dascyllus trimaculatus, a site-attached planktivorous coral reef fish, to determine independently the effects of population density and group size on rates of individual growth and mortality. Somatic growth of D. trimaculatus was positively related to the density of D. trimaculatus outplanted to host anenomes, Heteractis magnifica, with nearly twice as much growth observed in individuals living in the highest density treatment. By contrast, survivorship of D. trimaculatus on H. magnifica exhibited a negative relationship with density. There was no significant effect of group size on either the growth or mortality rates of D. trimaculatus. These relationships suggest a tradeoff between density-dependent growth and survival in this species. My analysis of behavioral data indicated that D. trimaculatus living under conditions of higher local population densities displayed decreased rates of intraspecific aggression because of positive feedback between local population density and the foraging distance from an individual’s host anemone. In turn, lower rates of aggression and feeding higher in the water column resulted in increased somatic growth rates due to: (1) a reduced energy expenditure and (2) an increase in prey consumption. These data are part of a Master's Thesis published by ProQuest: Nielsen, Jessica Anne. Effects of density on behaviorally-mediated tradeoffs between growth and survivorship. MA Thesis, University of California Santa Barbara, 2013."

00025-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Study site and study organism All field work was conducted during the Austral winter of 2012 on the north shore of Moorea, French Polynesia (17º30’ S, 149º50’ W) (Fig. S1). The threespot dascyllus (Dascyllus trimaculatus) is found throughout the Indo-Pacific on coral reefs at depths up to 55 m (Allen 1991). The species is a diurnal planktivore, foraging in the water column during the day and taking shelter at night to avoid predation (Holbrook and Schmitt 2002). In Moorea, threespot dascyllus experience an average of two settlement peaks per lunar month (Holbrook and Schmitt 1997, Schmitt and Holbrook 1999b) when pulses of recruits settle to their host sea anemones (Heteractis magnifica) where they remain closely associated until reaching adulthood (Schmitt and Holbrook 1996, 1999a). Effects of density and group size on growth and survivorship We conducted a field experiment to explore effects of density and group size on growth and survivorship of newly-settled threespot dascyllus. Host anemones of two sizes [small (200 cm2) and large (400 cm2)] were transplanted to a shallow fringing reef (Fig. S1), and small (3 fish) or large (6 fish) groups of threespot dascyllus were established on these replicate habitat units to create three densities (1) low, 0.0075 fish/cm2, N = 4 large anemones with 3 fish each, (2) medium, 0.015 fish/cm2, N = 9 small anemones with 3 fish each and N = 6 large anemones with 6 fish each, and (3) high, 0.03 fish/cm2, N = 3 small anemones with 6 fish each (total number of fish = 93) (Table S1). This experimental design allowed for exploration of the effects of density across the low, medium and high density treatments, as well as assessment of effects of group size within the medium density treatment. The group sizes and densities reflect levels found naturally on reefs in Moorea (Schmitt and Holbrook 1996). Anemones were spaced at least 5 m apart along two parallel 50 m transects to reduce movement of focal fish among them. SCUBA divers using hand nets collected recently-settled threespot dascyllus (less than 20 mm total length, TL) from anemones in the lagoon. In the laboratory, fish were immersed in a seawater solution containing tetracycline antibiotic (250 mg l-1 of seawater for 12 hr; Schmitt 1984) to mark their otoliths, thereby enabling future verification of outplanted individuals. Initial TL and weight were recorded for each fish, and they were assigned randomly to treatment. The anemones and outplanted threespot dascyllus were surveyed daily by SCUBA divers. Any new threespot dascyllus that settled naturally were easily distinguished from the outplanted fish by the absence of pigmentation in their caudal peduncle and caudal fin (Schmitt and Holbrook 1997), and they were immediately removed. When experimental fish were lost, replacement individuals were added to maintain the treatments; they were fin-clipped to distinguish them from the original outplants. All losses of fish were considered mortalities as emigration is extremely unlikely at this life stage (Schmitt and Holbrook 1996, 1999a). After one month, fish were collected by SCUBA divers using hand nets. Collection of fish occurred at approximately 1400 hr. TL was measured for each fish and wet weight was determined using a Mettler-Toledo balance (XS104, Mettler-Toledo Inc., Columbus, OH). Only individuals that remained on their host anemone for a minimum of two weeks were used in the analysis of individual growth rates, insuring sufficiently long exposure to their assigned treatment to have impacted their somatic growth. We were unable to maintain the appropriate treatment on one of the anemones, so this anemone and its 4 resident fish were excluded from the final growth analysis. Of the original 93 fish deployed, 68 individuals (73%) survived, and 6 additional replacement fish had resided on anemones for at least two weeks, for a total of 74 individuals used in the analysis of growth (mean length of outplant period = 29 days). To assess differences in growth between treatments while taking into account differences in initial body sizes, daily growth rates were calculated for each individual using the following equation: (lnfinal length - lninitial length) Equation 1 number of days on host anemone We monitored survivorship of 623 three spot dascyllus residing on 28 anemones. Survivorship was modeled using a generalized linear mixed model via penalized quasi-likelihood (glmmPQL) assuming a quasibinomial error distribution and right censored data. The model generated by decoupling density and group size found group size to be non-significant, so only density was used as a predictor variable in the final analysis. Otoliths, the digestive tract, and liver samples were removed from fish on the day of collection, then weighed and preserved. Analysis of the gut contents was conducted for fish from the low density/small group size treatment (N = 11 fish) and the high density/large group size treatment (N = 16 fish). Preserved gut contents from each sampled individual were spread in a petri dish and examined under a dissecting microscope. All prey items were counted, and a subsample of 10 randomly selected prey items from each gut was identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and sized. In order to determine if there was an effect of fish density on the consumption of prey, the mean number of prey items present in the stomach was calculated for each of the two density treatments. Effects of density and group size on behavior We assessed patterns of key behaviors of the fish during the course of the field experiment. GoPro® video cameras were deployed during the daylight foraging period between 09:00 and 16:30 to provide estimates of feeding and intraspecific aggression rates, foraging distances from the host anemone, and vigilance. These measures shed light on potential costs and benefits to fish living at different densities. To determine feeding rates, bites per minute were recorded for focal individuals. For each hour of video, feeding rate of a randomly selected fish in each of twelve two-minute time segments was measured. During these same time segments, the total number of chases made by all individuals on the anemone also was recorded to quantify intraspecific aggression rates (calculated as number of chases/individual/min). The total hours of video footage used in behavioral analyses were 12 (low density), 37 (medium density - small anemones with 3 fish each), 23 (medium density - large anemones with 6 fish each), and 16 (high density). Newly recruited threespot dascyllus rise above their host anemone to feed in the water column. Individuals that forage higher in the water column than their conspecifics may have enhanced access to prey items, but the increased distance to shelter can result in higher vulnerability to predators. To assess foraging distance (maximum distance (cm) an individual was observed away from the edge of its host anemone measurement) a calibrated pole was placed in the field of view for all video deployments to utilize as a reference. Individuals that were observed to forage at distances greater than 30 centimeters from their host anemone, including all instances in which an individual foraged outside of the frame of the video, were assigned to a foraging distance category of >30 cm. Data were recorded for each fish on an anemone at twelve different time points per hour of video. A vigilance measurement quantified the amount of time individuals spent exhibiting anti-predatory behavior. Average vigilance time was calculated by multiplying the per capita flight response rates and average refractory period for every individual that exhibited a flight response on each treatment. A flight response was considered to occur when an individual was threatened and retreated into the host anemone. The refractory period was defined as the length of time that elapsed between entry into the anemone shelter and emergence to resume feeding. Data were recorded for one ten-minute segment within each hour of video. The influence of density-dependent and number-dependent processes on individual demographic rates often results in ecological tradeoffs. Because such processes have important implications for individual level fitness and population regulation, they long have been an important topic in ecological research. I used Dascyllus trimaculatus, a site-attached planktivorous coral reef fish, to determine independently the effects of population density and group size on rates of individual growth and mortality. Somatic growth of D. trimaculatus was positively related to the density of D. trimaculatus outplanted to host anenomes, Heteractis magnifica, with nearly twice as much growth observed in individuals living in the highest density treatment. By contrast, survivorship of D. trimaculatus on H. magnifica exhibited a negative relationship with density. There was no significant effect of group size on either the growth or mortality rates of D. trimaculatus. These relationships suggest a tradeoff between density-dependent growth and survival in this species. My analysis of behavioral data indicated that D. trimaculatus living under conditions of higher local population densities displayed decreased rates of intraspecific aggression because of positive feedback between local population density and the foraging distance from an individual’s host anemone. In turn, lower rates of aggression and feeding higher in the water column resulted in increased somatic growth rates due to: (1) a reduced energy expenditure and (2) an increase in prey consumption. These methods are part of a Master's Thesis published by ProQuest: Nielsen, Jessica Anne. Effects of density on behaviorally-mediated tradeoffs between growth and survivorship.

To assess differences in growth between treatments while taking into account differences in initial body sizes, daily growth rates were calculated for each individual using the following equation: (lnfinal length - lninitial length) Equation 1 number of days on host anemone We monitored survivorship of 623 three spot dascyllus residing on 28 anemones. Survivorship was modeled using a generalized linear mixed model via penalized quasi-likelihood (glmmPQL) assuming a quasibinomial error distribution and right censored data. The model generated by decoupling density and group size found group size to be non-significant, so only density was used as a predictor variable in the final analysis. Otoliths, the digestive tract, and liver samples were removed from fish on the day of collection, then weighed and preserved. Analysis of the gut contents was conducted for fish from the low density/small group size treatment (N = 11 fish) and the high density/large group size treatment (N = 16 fish). Preserved gut contents from each sampled individual were spread in a petri dish and examined under a dissecting microscope. All prey items were counted, and a subsample of 10 randomly selected prey items from each gut was identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible and sized. In order to determine if there was an effect of fish density on the consumption of prey, the mean number of prey items present in the stomach was calculated for each of the two density treatments. Effects of density and group size on behavior We assessed patterns of key behaviors of the fish during the course of the field experiment. GoPro® video cameras were deployed during the daylight foraging period between 09:00 and 16:30 to provide estimates of feeding and intraspecific aggression rates, foraging distances from the host anemone, and vigilance. These measures shed light on potential costs and benefits to fish living at different densities. To determine feeding rates, bites per minute were recorded for focal individuals. For each hour of video, feeding rate of a randomly selected fish in each of twelve two-minute time segments was measured. During these same time segments, the total number of chases made by all individuals on the anemone also was recorded to quantify intraspecific aggression rates (calculated as number of chases/individual/min). The total hours of video footage used in behavioral analyses were 12 (low density), 37 (medium density - small anemones with 3 fish each), 23 (medium density - large anemones with 6 fish each), and 16 (high density). Newly recruited threespot dascyllus rise above their host anemone to feed in the water column. Individuals that forage higher in the water column than their conspecifics may have enhanced access to prey items, but the increased distance to shelter can result in higher vulnerability to predators. To assess foraging distance (maximum distance (cm) an individual was observed away from the edge of its host anemone measurement) a calibrated pole was placed in the field of view for all video deployments to utilize as a reference. Individuals that were observed to forage at distances greater than 30 centimeters from their host anemone, including all instances in which an individual foraged outside of the frame of the video, were assigned to a foraging distance category of >30 cm. Data were recorded for each fish on an anemone at twelve different time points per hour of video. A vigilance measurement quantified the amount of time individuals spent exhibiting anti-predatory behavior. Average vigilance time was calculated by multiplying the per capita flight response rates and average refractory period for every individual that exhibited a flight response on each treatment. A flight response was considered to occur when an individual was threatened and retreated into the host anemone. The refractory period was defined as the length of time that elapsed between entry into the anemone shelter and emergence to resume feeding. Data were recorded for one ten-minute segment within each hour of video. The influence of density-dependent and number-dependent processes on individual demographic rates often results in ecological tradeoffs. Because such processes have important implications for individual level fitness and population regulation, they long have been an important topic in ecological research. I used Dascyllus trimaculatus, a site-attached planktivorous coral reef fish, to determine independently the effects of population density and group size on rates of individual growth and mortality. Somatic growth of D. trimaculatus was positively related to the density of D. trimaculatus outplanted to host anenomes, Heteractis magnifica, with nearly twice as much growth observed in individuals living in the highest density treatment. By contrast, survivorship of D. trimaculatus on H. magnifica exhibited a negative relationship with density. There was no significant effect of group size on either the growth or mortality rates of D. trimaculatus. These relationships suggest a tradeoff between density-dependent growth and survival in this species. My analysis of behavioral data indicated that D. trimaculatus living under conditions of higher local population densities displayed decreased rates of intraspecific aggression because of positive feedback between local population density and the foraging distance from an individual’s host anemone. In turn, lower rates of aggression and feeding higher in the water column resulted in increased somatic growth rates due to: (1) a reduced energy expenditure and (2) an increase in prey consumption. These methods are part of a Master's Thesis published by ProQuest: Nielsen, Jessica Anne. Effects of density on behaviorally-mediated tradeoffs between growth and survivorship.

The stage height was measured at the time of discharge measurement. Continuous stage height readings collected on an hourly basis were then used to calculate continuous discharge using a rating curve for each summer. Temperature was also measured by a HOBO sensor near this location. Discharge was calculated using stage levels measured by the Water and Environment Research Center using a rating curve that they developed.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs.

00030-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In this larger study, we are asking the question: Is old carbon that comprises the bulk of the soil organic matter pool released in response to thawing of permafrost? We are answering this question by using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure radiocarbon isotope ratios in soil organic matter, soil respiration, and decomposition in tundra ecosystems. The objective of these proposed measurements is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the SOM sources contributing to C losses following permafrost thawing. We are making these measurements at an established tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. Field measurements center on a natural experiment where permafrost has been observed to warm and thaw over the past several decades. This area represents a gradient of sites each with a different degree of change due to permafrost thawing. As such, this area is unique for addressing questions at the time and spatial scales relevant for change in arctic ecosystems. This data set includes the growing season radiocarbon values of ecosystem and plant respiration at the thaw gradient and CiPEHR (a permafrost warming experiment). Depending on the year, the measurements were taken monthly during the growing season or just once a growing season."

00030-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design The study site at the Eight Mile Lake watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope at this site, in a 30 m deep borehole that was installed in 1985 before the permafrost started to thaw. While permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding depending on local topography, this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands. In this watershed, we monitored three sites that represented differing amounts of change as a result of permafrost thaw based on observations of ground subsidence and depth of thaw. Our minimal thaw site had the shallowest summer thaw depth and the least ground surface subsidence, and the vegetation was typical moist acidic tundra, dominated by the tussock-forming sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, with coexisting deciduous and evergreen shrubs, and an understory of mosses and lichens. A second site, located adjacent to the borehole, had moderate summer thaw depths and increased ground subsidence. Here the vegetation composition was similar to our minimal thaw site, but with increased biomass of all plant groups. Lastly, an extensive thaw site was located in an area where permafrost degradation had occurred at least several decades prior to the establishment of the borehole; thermokarst can already be observed in air photos of the area taken in 1954. This site had the deepest summer thaw depth and the most ground subsidence, and the plant biomass has shifted to dominance by shrubs, including blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), at the expense of sedges. Four radiocarbon measurements were collected from each site, but usually, only three were run for radiocarbon. At CiPEHR, there are two experimental warming treatments: Winter warming (WW) increases soil temperature and ground thaw using snow fences; Summer warming (SW) increases growing season air temperature using open top chambers. Six chambers are in each treatment, but only samples from half the chambers were run in 2009. geoReference 2004-09-01 2012-09-01 Sampling Frequency monthly or annual"

00033-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Research Methods: The 1959 data was digitized from a bound copy of the City of Phoenix Advanced Planning Task Force’s 1959 study Land Use of the Phoenix Urban Area1 based on a map of proposed 1960 Census tracts and data tables detailing land-use by acreage by tract for the categories “Single-Family”, “Two-Family”, “Multifamily”, “Commerce”, “Industry”, “Streets and Alleys”, “Public and Semipublic”, “Agriculture”, and “Canals and Vacant” (43-46). Microsoft OneNote was used to convert the scanned 1959 land-use tables to text. The resulting tables were then exported to Microsoft Excel and corrected manually to match the original scan. The scanned tracts map was georeferenced in ESRI ArcGIS and compared to a 1960 Census Tracts shapefile available from the National Historic GIS database (NHGIS). Boundary mismatch was corrected by consolidating some tracts (denoted by hyphens in the “TRACT_NUM” field). The data tables were aggregated accordingly and joined to tracts in ArcGIS. The 2012 time point was generated using 2012 Maricopa County Assessor parcel data with land-use classified based on the property use code (“PUC”) field (see “Phoenix Land-Use and Zoning by Urban Villages” dataset, also available through CAP; land-use for this dataset was classified from an earlier April 2013 version). Land-use was then reclassified to match the categories present in the 1959 Land Use of the Phoenix Urban Area, using the classification scheme outlined in Harland Bartholomew’s 1955 Land uses in American cities2 as a reference. Classified parcels were intersected by 1960 tract boundaries to split large parcels falling in more than one tract. The acreage of each parcel (“Area_Ac”) was calculated, and parcels were aggregated to census tract boundaries by category using a Spatial Join. For the 1959 data, “Single-Family” and “Two-Family” residential were consolidated into a single “SFR” class, which was already classified for the 2012 data. “Streets and Alleys” were omitted from the aggregated land total for each tract, as the 2012 data already accounts for their absence. Since the 2012 parcel data also omits canals, the acreage of canals in each tract for 1959 was subtracted from the “Canals and Vacant” class to generate a Vacant-only (“VAC”) class. This was performed by buffering a 1961 Canals shapefile digitized from historical Salt River Project canal system maps available at the ASU Libraries Map Collection. For smaller lateral canals, 20-foot flat buffer estimates of the canal and right-of-way were calculated; for major canals (Arizona Canal, Grand Canal, Western Canal west to Elliot Rd), 45-foot flat buffer estimates of the canal and right-of-way were calculated. The buffer polygons representing canals were then intersected by tract boundaries, and their acreages were subtracted from the initial “Canals and Vacant” total to generate the “Vacant” class. Only one tract (7-58) resulted in negative area, which was reset to 0 acres under the assumptions that a) all vacant land originally classified for 1959 was a canal or right-of-way and b) that the 1961 canals shapefile under-accounts for the length of canals present in 1959 (the tract is largely agricultural in 1959). For each time point, a “Land_Total” class summing the acreages of each category by tract, excluding canals/streets/alleys, was calculated. Finally, the shares of each land-use category were calculated based on the “Land_Total” field. 1Advance Planning Task Force, Phoenix and Maricopa County, Arizona. (1959).

00033-metadata.xml,Project Description,/eml:eml/dataset/project,"Phoenix Spatial History Project Joseph Tuccillo author This dataset serves to compare the Phoenix Metro’s post-war and contemporary land-use patterns by 1960 census tracts for the timepoints 1959 and 2012. Each timepoint features aggregated land-use acreage by tract for the categories Single Family Residential, Multifamily Residential, Commercial, Public/Semipublic, Light Industrial, Industrial, Vacant, and Agriculture, as well as the share of each land-use category within each tract, excluding streets, alleys, and canals. The 1959 data may be joined with US Census data for 1960 tracts (via National Historic GIS database). As the aggregation units are based on proposed 1960 census tracts, several tracts were combined such that their boundaries matched those of the official 1960 US Census. This is detailed further in the methods description."

Boat electrofishing is an effective sampling technique in freshwater habitats, including the Everglades, and has been used successfully to sample upper estuarine fish communities (Rehage and Loftus 2007). We conducted three replicate electrofishing bouts (timed sampling transects) at fixed locations in each site, each 200 m apart. For each bout, we ran the boat at idle speed at a randomly-selected creek shoreline and applied power for 5 min of time, during which two netters captured all immobilized fishes. We standardize power output to 1500 Watts, given temperature and conductance conditions measured at the beginning of each bout.

Transmitters were set to emit a unique series of pulses for each shark at a random interval between 60 and 180 s (mean emission interval = 120 s). Movements of acoustically tagged sharks were tracked within an array of 43 Vemco VR2 and VR2W acoustic receivers. In situ measurements revealed mean detection ranges of receivers were c. 500 m. Each receiver was attached to a PVC pipe set in a 10-kg cement anchor. Data from receivers were downloaded every 3–4 months for the duration of the study, and batteries were replaced as needed.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Species abundance was determined by hand-collecting all the infaunal and epifaunal molluscs from within quadrats of known area in mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in ethanol, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, counted and measured (size data is reported separately). The counts were converted to number per square meter. Gastropod species are listed first, followed by bivalve species. Size distribution data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-1407a."

00035-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Molusc Collection A quadrat device, constructed of treated, 1' X 3/4' slats, drilled and joined with bolts and wing nuts, was designed to enclose selectable areas of 0.0625, 0.25 or 0.5 m^2. The quadrat size used for each sample may have varied between plots, zones, and sites and was dependent on apparent density of molluscs (particularly Littoraria) in the immediate area. In high density areas, smaller quadrats were used and vice versa. Quadrat selection was guided by the need to balance accuracy of abundance estimates, prevention of excessive removal of fauna and ensurance that field sampling was kept to a reasonable amount of time. The quadrat was placed around the bases of the plants in the selected sampling area. Snails are collected first, from the standing plants. Collection started at the tops of the plants and proceeded downward to the marsh surface. Particular attention was given to enrolled, scenescing leaves, when present, as new recruits and smaller species were often concentrated there. After the plants had been inspected, the marsh surface was examined for snails and signs of infaunal bivalves. After all epifaunal molluscs were removed, the infaunal bivalves were dug from the sediment. This often required feeling (centimeter by centimeter) along the marsh surface and probing down inside large crab holes to make sure all individuals were collected. All molluscs were placed in pre-labeled plastic bags and transported back to the lab. The molluscs were washed free of sediment over a sieve (< 500 micron-mesh), fixed with ethanol and ultimately transferred to and preserved in 70-95% ethanol. Missing values were recorded on data sheets when observations could not be made due to problems locating plots, loss of plots (creek bank erosion, trampling), logistical problems accessing plots, tidal inundation or other factors. 2013-10-14 2013-10-18 GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA. Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR.

Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland. -81.370752 -81.357256 31.463533 31.448419 GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA. Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound. No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data. -81.354413 -81.327201 31.442538 31.417640 GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse. A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert.

Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island. This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock). -81.295506 -81.258908 31.497026 31.462320 Fall 2013 Mollosc Abundance Samples were taken within 3 meters of the GCE permanent monitoring plots, which were established in the marsh areas at each GCE sampling site in October, 2000. Each site was divided into two nominal zones -- creekbank and mid-marsh -- and eight plots were randomly located in each zone and marked with stakes. This study represents a regular component of the population monitoring program of the GCE-LTER. It was designed to document abundance and spatial distribution of common infaunal and epifaunal molluscs and track their changes over time at each of the ten intertidal marsh monitoring sites within the GCE-LTER domain. All molluscs within randomly placed, small quadrats at four plots in the mid and creekbank marshes at each of the permanent monitoring sites were collected by hand. This design resulted in four replicate samples per zone (n = 4) at each site (n = 8 per site). Collections were made by different teams of trained individuals (staff and volunteers). Molluscs were returned to the lab, preserved and enumerated. For each sample, an area of marsh was selected that was similar in gross appearance and near to (within 3 m of) a GCE permanent monitoring plot. The permanent plots were not used so as to avoid damaging the plants within them. Permanent plots 1, 3, 6, and 8 in each zone were chosen to be the anchor plots for selecting actual sample areas. When wrack or other disturbances necessitated the use of alternate plots, these are indicated in the data set and noted as anomalies. INV-GCEM-1407.kml"

00035-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Molusc Collection A quadrat device, constructed of treated, 1' X 3/4' slats, drilled and joined with bolts and wing nuts, was designed to enclose selectable areas of 0.0625, 0.25 or 0.5 m^2. The quadrat size used for each sample may have varied between plots, zones, and sites and was dependent on apparent density of molluscs (particularly Littoraria) in the immediate area. In high density areas, smaller quadrats were used and vice versa. Quadrat selection was guided by the need to balance accuracy of abundance estimates, prevention of excessive removal of fauna and ensurance that field sampling was kept to a reasonable amount of time. The quadrat was placed around the bases of the plants in the selected sampling area. Snails are collected first, from the standing plants. Collection started at the tops of the plants and proceeded downward to the marsh surface. Particular attention was given to enrolled, scenescing leaves, when present, as new recruits and smaller species were often concentrated there. After the plants had been inspected, the marsh surface was examined for snails and signs of infaunal bivalves. After all epifaunal molluscs were removed, the infaunal bivalves were dug from the sediment. This often required feeling (centimeter by centimeter) along the marsh surface and probing down inside large crab holes to make sure all individuals were collected. All molluscs were placed in pre-labeled plastic bags and transported back to the lab. The molluscs were washed free of sediment over a sieve (< 500 micron-mesh), fixed with ethanol and ultimately transferred to and preserved in 70-95% ethanol. Missing values were recorded on data sheets when observations could not be made due to problems locating plots, loss of plots (creek bank erosion, trampling), logistical problems accessing plots, tidal inundation or other factors. 2013-10-14 2013-10-18 GCE Study Site GCE1 -- Eulonia, Georgia, USA. Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area. Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge. -81.428481 -81.410732 31.546750 31.533963 GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA. Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like 'Sutherland Bluff', are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater. -81.318961 -81.292844 31.552554 31.533604 GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site. Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island. -81.233249 -81.195661 31.546868 31.515188 GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA. Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland. -81.370752 -81.357256 31.463533 31.448419 GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA. Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound. No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data. -81.354413 -81.327201 31.442538 31.417640 GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse. A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity and genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu) -81.299522 -81.264378 31.394072 31.371003 GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.

Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site. -81.493498 -81.475900 31.348774 31.334364 GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA. Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings. -81.426272 -81.410634 31.317808 31.304063 GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA. Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings. -81.346730 -81.326495 31.358142 31.339173 GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island. This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock). -81.295506 -81.258908 31.497026 31.462320 Fall 2013 Mollosc Abundance Samples were taken within 3 meters of the GCE permanent monitoring plots, which were established in the marsh areas at each GCE sampling site in October, 2000. Each site was divided into two nominal zones -- creekbank and mid-marsh -- and eight plots were randomly located in each zone and marked with stakes. This study represents a regular component of the population monitoring program of the GCE-LTER. It was designed to document abundance and spatial distribution of common infaunal and epifaunal molluscs and track their changes over time at each of the ten intertidal marsh monitoring sites within the GCE-LTER domain. All molluscs within randomly placed, small quadrats at four plots in the mid and creekbank marshes at each of the permanent monitoring sites were collected by hand. This design resulted in four replicate samples per zone (n = 4) at each site (n = 8 per site). Collections were made by different teams of trained individuals (staff and volunteers). Molluscs were returned to the lab, preserved and enumerated. For each sample, an area of marsh was selected that was similar in gross appearance and near to (within 3 m of) a GCE permanent monitoring plot. The permanent plots were not used so as to avoid damaging the plants within them. Permanent plots 1, 3, 6, and 8 in each zone were chosen to be the anchor plots for selecting actual sample areas. When wrack or other disturbances necessitated the use of alternate plots, these are indicated in the data set and noted as anomalies. INV-GCEM-1407.kml"

Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Automatically-assigned qualifier flags are reviewed graphically and revised or augmented as deemed appropriate by GCE information management staff, based on metadata information from the contributor, values of other measured variables, or statistical tests. Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column."

Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER is located along three adjacent sounds on the Atlantic coast and includes both intertidal marshes and estuaries. Long-term drivers of climate change, sea level rise and human alterations of the landscape will cause transitions in dominant habitat types (state changes) within the GCE domain by changing the amounts and patterns of water delivery across the landscape. These changes in water delivery can be conceptualized as presses and pulses in river inflow, local runoff, groundwater input, and tidal inundation, which will in turn manifest themselves as changes in salinity and inundation patterns in the domain. The research proposed for GCE-III is designed to address how variations in salinity and inundation, driven by climate change and anthropogenic factors, affect biotic and ecosystem responses at different spatial and temporal scales, and to predict the consequences of these changes for habitat provisioning and carbon (C) sequestration across the coastal landscape. The goals are to: 1) Track long-term changes in climate and human actions in the watershed and adjacent uplands, and evaluate the effects of these drivers on domain boundary conditions. 2) Describe temporal and spatial variability in physical, chemical, geological and biological, and to evaluate how they are affected by variations in river inflow and other boundary conditions. 3) Characterize the responses of three dominant habitats in the domain to pulses and presses in salinity and inundation. 4) Describe patterns of habitat provisioning and C sequestration and export in the GCE domain, and to evaluate how these might be affected by changes in salinity and inundation. These efforts will be synthesized into a synoptic understanding of both biotic and ecosystem responses to variations in salinity and inundation driven by climate change and human activities, which will be used to assess thresholds between habitats and the potential for state changes in the domain.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

00037-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Pacific Labeled Corals is an aggregate dataset containing 2318 coral reef survey images from four Pacific monitoring projects in Moorea (French Polynesia), the northern Line Islands, Nanwan Bay (Taiwan) and Heron Reef (Australia). Pacific Labeled Corals contain a total of 318828 expert annotations across 4 pacific reef locations, and can be used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating object recognition methods and texture descriptors as well as for domain transfer learning research. The images have all been annotated using a random point annotation tool by a coral reef expert. In addition, 200 images from each location have been cross-annotatoed by 6 experts, for a total of 7 sets of annotations for each image. These data will be published in Beijbom O., et al., 'Transforming benthic surveys through automated image annotation' (in submission). These data are a subset of the raw data from which knb-lter-mcr.4 is derived."

Photoquadrats Quantitative high resolution digital images, each aproximately 2.5 to 3.2 Mb in JPEG format, with aproximately 2000 x 2000 pixels or 4 megapixels. Parameters for Photoquadrat Analysis CPCe software is used to quantify the area of benthic taxa using a matrix of 200 randomly spaced dots each 15 pixels in diameter. Image row and column pixel are counted from (1,1). Prior to the use of CPCe the area of benthic taxa was quantified by superimposing a matrix of 200 randomly located circles on the image and counting the circles landing on the substratum category of interest. Identification has been assigned by one field technician from 2005 through 2007 and another from 2008 through present. This dataset contains photoquadrats from 2008 through 2010 only. Sampling design for quadrats on the reef The sampling strategy was designed to facilitate tests of the effect of time and shore on the coral community structure of the fringing, and outer reef habitats of Moorea. For the purpose of this analysis, fringing communities were defined as reefs adjacent to the shore and within ca. 50 m of the land. Outer reef habitats were located on the outer reef, and were censused at 10 m and 17 m depth in order to sample habitats that are representative of the outer reefs of Moorea, and within the depth range for tractable to diving research. A nested, factorial ANOVA experimental design was employed in all sampling strategies. Shore was treated as a fixed factor, site as a random factor nested within shore, and time was a repeated measures factor based on individual quadrats that could be relocated (at the fringe and outer sites), or discrete patches of reef that could be revisited (in the lagoon). In the case of the outer reef, depth also was used as a fixed factor in order to contrast the effects of time and shore between depths. All census methods were designed to quantify coral community structure in terms of the dominant constituents of the benthic community - scleractinian corals, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, algal turf and, in some cases sand - and for both the fringing and outer reef habitats, allowed the scleractinian community structure to be resolved to genus level. Methodological problems (described below) in the lagoon habitat prevented genus-level resolution of the scleractinians, but such resolution should be attainable in Year II. In addition to establishing an orthogonal contrast of coral community structure, a subset of the sites and habitats were selected for more detailed analyses of the population density of coral recruits and juvenile corals, as well as the demographic analysis of selected coral species. The time-consuming nature of these analyses prevented them from being measured in all site/habitat combinations. Quality Control issues in benthic community analysis This data set is based on photographic images recorded using a 0.5 x 0. 5 m photoquadrat and a high resolution SLR digital camera. For the outer reef and fringing reef sampling, photoquadrats are repositioned each year at the same spot along the transect, although the corners of the quadrat are not marked. The photoquadrat is placed with a high degree of precision each year, but currents and waves can result in repositioning errors. To screen for these effects, matched photographs in consecutive years are evaluated using a software routine for changes in coral cover that exceed 20%; such changes are unlikely to occur through biological processes (although they could arise from importation of colonies following storms). All photographs at each site are compared with matched images in the following year, and discrepancies of >20% coral cover are flagged for investigation. Typically <1% of the images require further investigation each year. Reference for taxonomy Veron JEN (2000) Corals of the World - Volumes 1, 2, 3.

00038-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"There are three types of forest metrics within this database. They all are derived from the raw Lidar point clouds using the FUSION software. The three types are canopy closure, height metric, and stem mapping. The canopy closure and height metric grids cover a variety of canopy heights and grid cell sizes. 1. Canopy closure: This metric measures the canopy closure of a given horizontal cell above a given vertical threshold (height break). Canopy closure can inform many landscape models and provide insight on how much light will reach the forest floor. 2. Height Metric: This metric measures the height at which a given percent of the first return points are below. This analysis is done in a given grid cell size. Height metrics give various statistics of the elevation above ground for a given set of Lidar points. In forested landscapes, first return height metrics describe the forest canopy. 3.This stem map locates the approximate center of all trees in the HJ Andrews Research Forest greater than 10 meters. In addition to the stem location, a canopy radius is also provided. FUSION and TreeVaWA software programs were used to develop this data. Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WS) collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from HJ Andrews and the Willamette National Forest (NF) on August 10th and 11th 2008. Total area for this AOI is 17,705 acres. The total area of delivered LiDAR including 100 m buffer is 19,493 acres."

Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics. Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources. Data were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest research program, funded by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 08-23380), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and Oregon State University. National Science Foundation: DEB0823380 The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms."

YSI Sonde sensors consist of 6150 optical dissolved oxygen probe , 6560 conductivity/temperature probe (thermistor) and vented level depth sensor (stainless steel strain gauge). Missing data or blank values are caused by maintenance time periods or where sensor measurements are obviously wrong in the context of what would be expected. For example, the conductivity sensor has a relatively small opening and chamber for the conductivity electrodes, the estuary can have varying suspended sediment/detrital loads moving in the water column which enter the conductivity cell shorting out the electrodes making a faulty conductivity measurement (lower than expected). Oxygen measurements are dependent upon the conductivity measurements so the oxygen also becomes erroneous. Obvious measurements/data errors have been removed from the data set however the user of this data should also conduct their own data analysis to determine if the data are suitable for their particular situation. Typical sensor/data problems are: For oxygen: Poor/inaccurate conductivity measurements will affect the dissolved oxygen accuracy For conductivity: Conductivity cell can have detrital material stuck in it, shorting out cell, resulting in lower than expected conductivity. For depth: Depth strain gage pressure sensor may come out of the water at low tides resulting in many 'zero' depth readings or sometimes negative values. YSI Dissolved oxygen % saturation reporting can vary depending upon how the oxygen is calibrated. For this data set two Oxygen percent saturation values are reported. ODO%YSI variable name represents a YSI calibration in air, from Standard Methods, refers to calibration at a particular ATM pressure which allows DO% for calibration to fluctuate above/below 100% when ATM is above/below reference 760 or 1 ATM ODO%Local variable name represents an oxygen calibration in air at a particular ATM pressure but it forces the DO% to be 100%, does not allow it to be under or above if ATM is above/below 760. ODO%Local data should be used for metabolism studies when correcting for diffusion based on gradient deviations from 100% which by definition is the % saturation of oxygen in air. ODO%YSI should not be used since it would require a known ATM pressure at each interval to calculate the ATM % saturation of oxygen to be use for that interval, probably a small correction anyway. Concentration of DO remains the same for either calibration. Several days in Oct 2012 were extremely cloudy/rainy resulting in low battery conditions as the solar panel could not charge enough. No data was recorded during these low battery periods. A Campbell CR1000 is logging the data and we use radio telemetry to a base station in Rowley for streaming the data and downloading to a computer."

A Campbell CR1000 is logging the data and we use radio telemetry to a base station in Rowley for streaming the data and downloading to a computer."

00041-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Urban growth models have increasingly been used by planners and policy makers to visualize, organize, understand, and predict urban growth. However, these models reveal a wide disparity in their attention to policy factors. Some urban growth models capture few if any specific policy effects (e.g.,as model variables), while others integrate certain policies but not others. Since zoning policies are the most widely used form of land use control in the United States, their conspicuous absence from so many urban growth models is surprising. This research investigated the impacts of zoning on urban growth by calibrating and simulating a cellular automaton urban growth model, SLEUTH, under two conditions in a South Florida location. The first condition integrated restrictive agricultural zoning into SLEUTH, while the other ignored zoning data. Goodness of fit metrics indicate that including the agricultural zoning data improved model performance. The results further suggest that agricultural zoning has been somewhat successful in retarding urban growth in South Florida. Ignoring zoning information is detrimental to SLEUTH performance in particular, and urban growth modeling in general."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE. National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514, #0620409 and DEB-1237517 The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park. There are a total of 20 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle. -81.078 -80.490 25.761 24.913 2012-12-01 2018-12-01"

This included ten flight lines flown for the examination of salt marsh and upland vegetation spectral properties near Blackbeard Creek, the Duplin River, Dean Creek, and the Altamaha River. Imagery was acquired for 63 bands from 400-980 nm at a 1 m spatial resolution. The bandwidths were preselected by investigators with CALMIT to to capture the vegetative red reflectance feature, leaf water content related NIR reflectance, and carotenoid and chlorophyll driven absorption behaviors. These data were acquired for the following purposes: 1) calculate suites of remote sensing vegetation indices, (2) produce algorithms for predicting plant and phytoplankton chlorophyll and accessory pigments, vegetation biomass, 3) assess vegetative health, and (4) perform atmospheric corrections."

00044-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Image Aquistion The AISA sensor was mounted in a Piper Saratoga plane flown at 1650 m above ground level. It collected spectral data in 63 bands for vegetated targets in the visible and NIR portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 400-980 nm (9 nm full width half maximum spectral resolution, 2.3 nm spectral sampling; 2.9 nm spectral resolution). For each location (Blackbeard, Duplin, Dean Creek, and Altamaha vegetation) flight lines of data were captured in a northeast to southwest alignment. The flight lines were acquired in mid-morning, to coincide with low tide and exposed extensive areas of intertidal mud. The aircraft was flown in a “racetrack” path, meaning that the plane turned around to refly parallel swaths at the same downtrack orientation and with approximately 30% overlap of adjacent swaths. AISA Eagle Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications; manufacturer: AISA (model: Eagle); parameter: Reflectance Image Processing Initial post-processing of data was performed by CALMIT using the CaliGeo (Specim Imaging LTD, www.specim.fi) and Environment for Visualizing Imagery (ENVI, EXELIS, www.exelisvis.com) software programs. The processing sequence for each flight line consisted of (1) radiometric corrections applied to raw imagery; (2) GPS and altitude data used to calculate and apply static geometric correction factors; (3) image rectification and geocorrection; and (4) image data produced with pixel values as normalized percent reflectance using the FODIS downwelling solar information. Imagery was atmospherically corrected using FLAASH (Fast-Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercube), an atmospheric correction module for ENVI. Images were exported from ENVI as tiffs. AISA Eagle Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications; manufacturer: AISA (model: Eagle); parameter: Reflectance 2006-06-20 2006-06-21 GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse. A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity and genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu) -81.299522 -81.264378 31.394072 31.371003 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA.

00044-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Image Aquistion The AISA sensor was mounted in a Piper Saratoga plane flown at 1650 m above ground level. It collected spectral data in 63 bands for vegetated targets in the visible and NIR portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 400-980 nm (9 nm full width half maximum spectral resolution, 2.3 nm spectral sampling; 2.9 nm spectral resolution). For each location (Blackbeard, Duplin, Dean Creek, and Altamaha vegetation) flight lines of data were captured in a northeast to southwest alignment. The flight lines were acquired in mid-morning, to coincide with low tide and exposed extensive areas of intertidal mud. The aircraft was flown in a “racetrack” path, meaning that the plane turned around to refly parallel swaths at the same downtrack orientation and with approximately 30% overlap of adjacent swaths. AISA Eagle Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications; manufacturer: AISA (model: Eagle); parameter: Reflectance Image Processing Initial post-processing of data was performed by CALMIT using the CaliGeo (Specim Imaging LTD, www.specim.fi) and Environment for Visualizing Imagery (ENVI, EXELIS, www.exelisvis.com) software programs. The processing sequence for each flight line consisted of (1) radiometric corrections applied to raw imagery; (2) GPS and altitude data used to calculate and apply static geometric correction factors; (3) image rectification and geocorrection; and (4) image data produced with pixel values as normalized percent reflectance using the FODIS downwelling solar information. Imagery was atmospherically corrected using FLAASH (Fast-Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercube), an atmospheric correction module for ENVI. Images were exported from ENVI as tiffs. AISA Eagle Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications; manufacturer: AISA (model: Eagle); parameter: Reflectance 2006-06-20 2006-06-21 GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse. A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity and genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu) -81.299522 -81.264378 31.394072 31.371003 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, and OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, and OCE-1238212.

00046-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Pacific Labeled Corals is an aggregate dataset containing 2318 coral reef survey images from four Pacific monitoring projects in Moorea (French Polynesia), the northern Line Islands, Nanwan Bay (Taiwan) and Heron Reef (Australia). Pacific Labeled Corals contain a total of 318828 expert annotations across 4 pacific reef locations, and can be used as a benchmark dataset for evaluating object recognition methods and texture descriptors as well as for domain transfer learning research. The images have all been annotated using a random point annotation tool by a coral reef expert. In addition, 200 images from each location have been cross-annotatoed by 6 experts, for a total of 7 sets of annotations for each image. These data will be published in Beijbom O., et al., 'Transforming benthic surveys through automated image annotation' (in submission). These data are a subset of the raw data from which knb-lter-mcr.4 is derived."

00046-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Image data annotation More about the annotation methods can be read at this project's website http://vision.ucsd.edu/content/pacific-labeled-corals. Photoquadrats Quantitative high resolution digital images, each aproximately 2.5 to 3.2 Mb in JPEG format, with aproximately 2000 x 2000 pixels or 4 megapixels. Parameters for Photoquadrat Analysis CPCe software is used to quantify the area of benthic taxa using a matrix of 200 randomly spaced dots each 15 pixels in diameter. Image row and column pixel are counted from (1,1). Prior to the use of CPCe the area of benthic taxa was quantified by superimposing a matrix of 200 randomly located circles on the image and counting the circles landing on the substratum category of interest. Identification has been assigned by one field technician from 2005 through 2007 and another from 2008 through present. This dataset contains photoquadrats from 2008 through 2010 only. Sampling design for quadrats on the reef The sampling strategy was designed to facilitate tests of the effect of time and shore on the coral community structure of the fringing, and outer reef habitats of Moorea. For the purpose of this analysis, fringing communities were defined as reefs adjacent to the shore and within ca. 50 m of the land. Outer reef habitats were located on the outer reef, and were censused at 10 m and 17 m depth in order to sample habitats that are representative of the outer reefs of Moorea, and within the depth range for tractable to diving research. A nested, factorial ANOVA experimental design was employed in all sampling strategies. Shore was treated as a fixed factor, site as a random factor nested within shore, and time was a repeated measures factor based on individual quadrats that could be relocated (at the fringe and outer sites), or discrete patches of reef that could be revisited (in the lagoon). In the case of the outer reef, depth also was used as a fixed factor in order to contrast the effects of time and shore between depths. All census methods were designed to quantify coral community structure in terms of the dominant constituents of the benthic community - scleractinian corals, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, algal turf and, in some cases sand - and for both the fringing and outer reef habitats, allowed the scleractinian community structure to be resolved to genus level. Methodological problems (described below) in the lagoon habitat prevented genus-level resolution of the scleractinians, but such resolution should be attainable in Year II. In addition to establishing an orthogonal contrast of coral community structure, a subset of the sites and habitats were selected for more detailed analyses of the population density of coral recruits and juvenile corals, as well as the demographic analysis of selected coral species. The time-consuming nature of these analyses prevented them from being measured in all site/habitat combinations. Quality Control issues in benthic community analysis This data set is based on photographic images recorded using a 0.5 x 0. 5 m photoquadrat and a high resolution SLR digital camera. For the outer reef and fringing reef sampling, photoquadrats are repositioned each year at the same spot along the transect, although the corners of the quadrat are not marked. The photoquadrat is placed with a high degree of precision each year, but currents and waves can result in repositioning errors. To screen for these effects, matched photographs in consecutive years are evaluated using a software routine for changes in coral cover that exceed 20%; such changes are unlikely to occur through biological processes (although they could arise from importation of colonies following storms). All photographs at each site are compared with matched images in the following year, and discrepancies of >20% coral cover are flagged for investigation. Typically <1% of the images require further investigation each year. Reference for taxonomy Veron JEN (2000) Corals of the World - Volumes 1, 2, 3.

Photoquadrats Quantitative high resolution digital images, each aproximately 2.5 to 3.2 Mb in JPEG format, with aproximately 2000 x 2000 pixels or 4 megapixels. Parameters for Photoquadrat Analysis CPCe software is used to quantify the area of benthic taxa using a matrix of 200 randomly spaced dots each 15 pixels in diameter. Image row and column pixel are counted from (1,1). Prior to the use of CPCe the area of benthic taxa was quantified by superimposing a matrix of 200 randomly located circles on the image and counting the circles landing on the substratum category of interest. Identification has been assigned by one field technician from 2005 through 2007 and another from 2008 through present. This dataset contains photoquadrats from 2008 through 2010 only. Sampling design for quadrats on the reef The sampling strategy was designed to facilitate tests of the effect of time and shore on the coral community structure of the fringing, and outer reef habitats of Moorea. For the purpose of this analysis, fringing communities were defined as reefs adjacent to the shore and within ca. 50 m of the land. Outer reef habitats were located on the outer reef, and were censused at 10 m and 17 m depth in order to sample habitats that are representative of the outer reefs of Moorea, and within the depth range for tractable to diving research. A nested, factorial ANOVA experimental design was employed in all sampling strategies. Shore was treated as a fixed factor, site as a random factor nested within shore, and time was a repeated measures factor based on individual quadrats that could be relocated (at the fringe and outer sites), or discrete patches of reef that could be revisited (in the lagoon). In the case of the outer reef, depth also was used as a fixed factor in order to contrast the effects of time and shore between depths. All census methods were designed to quantify coral community structure in terms of the dominant constituents of the benthic community - scleractinian corals, macroalgae, crustose coralline algae, algal turf and, in some cases sand - and for both the fringing and outer reef habitats, allowed the scleractinian community structure to be resolved to genus level. Methodological problems (described below) in the lagoon habitat prevented genus-level resolution of the scleractinians, but such resolution should be attainable in Year II. In addition to establishing an orthogonal contrast of coral community structure, a subset of the sites and habitats were selected for more detailed analyses of the population density of coral recruits and juvenile corals, as well as the demographic analysis of selected coral species. The time-consuming nature of these analyses prevented them from being measured in all site/habitat combinations.

The objective of the study was to assess how streamwater values of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NO3- and Cl- and specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA) were related with the proportion of land in the watershed in urban areas, agriculture, and forest. Stream water samples were collected during baseflow conditions in February 2009 throughout the Willamette River basin, including the experimental watersheds (1,2,6,7,8,9,10), Lookout and Mack Creeks at the HJ Andrews Forest. Land use for each point-delineated watershed were determined from published values from the PNWERC dataset (http://www.fsl.orst.edu/pnwerc/wrb/access.html)."

Sample locations were chosen based on accessibility and to represent three dominant land use types: forest, agriculture, and urban. Bottles were lowered to stream surface, submerged and rinsed multiple times, then a 1-liter sample was taken from the stream. Sample was filtered to 0.7 micron (GF/F) and frozen prior to chemical analysis. Laboratory Methods - CF008 Stream samples were analyzed for concentrations of total nitrogen, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, total organic carbon, and chloride. Ammonium (NH4+), nitrate/nitrite (NO2-, NO3-), and chloride (Cl-) concentrations were determined via flow injection analysis using a Lachat QuikChem 4200 Analyzer (Lachat, 1992). Total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was determined using the high-temperature catalytic combustion method using a Shimadzu TOC-Vchs Analyzer (Shimadzu, 2001). Total nitrogen, including inorganic and organic forms of nitrogen, was determined using the catalytic thermal decomposition and chemiluminescence detection method using a Shimadzu TOC-V/TN analyzer (ENV, 1996; Jones and Daughton, 1985). Laboratory analyses were performed by the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Cooperative Chemical Analytical Laboratory (Corvallis, OR) using contemporary published methodology and safety protocols (APHA, 1992; US EPA, 1987). Specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA) was determined after Weishar et al, (2003) using a Shimadzu 1201 UV-VIS Spectrometer. Ultra-filtered Millipore Milli-Q™ water was used for calibration. Samples and sample blanks were placed in quartz-crystal, WhatmanTM sample cuvets and absorbance254nm determined. SUVA values are determined by normalizing absorbance254 for sample DOC concentration and have the units abs254 L mg-1 cm-1."

Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics. Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources. Data were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest research program, funded by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 08-23380), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and Oregon State University. National Science Foundation: DEB0823380 The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms."

Nelson mpnelson@oregonstate.edu http://www.michaelpnelson.com Principal Investigator Mark Schulze HJ Andrews Experimental Forest;PO Box 300 Blue River OR 97413 541-822-6336 mark.schulze@oregonstate.edu Principal Investigator The H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a living laboratory that provides unparalleled opportunities for the study of forest and stream ecosystems in the central Cascade Range of Oregon. Since 1980, as a part of the National Science Foundation Long Term Ecological Research (NSF-LTER) program, the Andrews Experimental Forest has become a leader in the analysis of forest and stream ecosystem dynamics. Long-term field experiments and measurement programs have focused on climate dynamics, streamflow, water quality, and vegetation succession. Currently researchers are working to develop concepts and tools needed to predict effects of natural disturbance, land use, and climate change on ecosystem structure, function, and species composition. The Andrews Experimental Forest is administered cooperatively by the USDA Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University and the Willamette National Forest. Funding for the research program comes from the National Science Foundation (NSF), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Oregon State University, and other sources. Data were provided by the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest research program, funded by the National Science Foundation's Long-Term Ecological Research Program (DEB 08-23380), US Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, and Oregon State University. National Science Foundation: DEB0823380 The Andrews Forest is situated in the western Cascade Range of Oregon, and covers the entire 15,800-acre (6400-ha) drainage basin of Lookout Creek. Elevation ranges from 1350 to 5340 feet (410 to 1630 m). Broadly representative of the rugged mountainous landscape of the Pacific Northwest, the Andrews Forest contains excellent examples of the region's conifer forests and associated wildlife and stream ecosystems. These forests are among the tallest and most productive in the world, with tree heights of often greater than 250 ft (75 m). Streams are steep, cold and clean, providing habitat for numerous aquatic organisms."

These data were collected as part of a number of studies between 1994 and 2012 in order to quantify variations in organic layer thickness and estimate organic layer carbon in burned and unburned black spruce stands. Data were collected in sites located on a number of topographic positions, and collected in sites that burned during different time periods during the fire season. Measurements that were collected at most sites included either the total thickness of the surface organic layer, or the thickness of individual layers within the organic layer. These layers include: moss (including green and brown), fibric soil, mesic soil, humic soil, and char. Beginning in 2005, data on the height of adventitious roots above mineral soil were collected and used to estimate the pre-burn organic layer thickness."

GPS coordinates were recorded at each site. In sites where data were collected prior to 2005, two 100 m transects separated by 50 m were placed in the center of the plot, and samples collected every 5 m. In sites established in 2005 and after, a 40 m baseline was located in a random direction in the plot center, which was bisected by three 30 m sample transects, one located at the center of the baseline and one located at a random distance from center on either side of the center transect. Sampling points were located every 5 m along each transect beginning at the beginning of the transect (7 points per transect). In some sites, organic layer thickness measurements were collected every 10 m (beginning at 5 m) along the baseline. Organic layer thickness measurements were measured from a 20 x 20 cm core extracted from the surface organic layer. In some plots, only the total thickness was measured, while in most plots, the thickness of individual layers were measured [moss (including green and brown), fibric soil, mesic soil, humic soil, and char]. At each sample point in burned stands, the nearest tree with a height > 2 m was selected and the distance of the top-most adventitious root above mineral soil (ARD) was measured. Based on an algorithm developed from data collected in unburned mature black spruce stants, organic layer thickness prior to the fire (OLT-P) was calculated as OLT-P = 1.03 ARD + 4.97. . geoReference 1994-06-01 2012-08-15 Sampling Frequency as needed"

00051-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In contribution to the Arctic Observing Network (AON), the researchers have established two observatories of landscape-level carbon, water and energy balances at Imnaviat Creek, Alaska and at Pleistocene Park near Cherskii, Russia. These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. In support of these objectives, a new 32m tower was deployed in Pleistocene Park, about 20km south of NESS. This station is currently measuring fluxes of carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor and energy in addition to other meteorological variables."

00051-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Similar to the other flux stations involved in the AON project, the Pleistocene Park Station generates two types of data: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

00051-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Similar to the other flux stations involved in the AON project, the Pleistocene Park Station generates two types of data: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system. In support of these objectives, a 3m eddy covariance station was established on Imnaviat Creek, Alaska. This station has been continuoulsy monitoring carbon dioxide, water vapor, energy fluxes and various micrometeorological variables. In contribution to the Arctic Observing Network (AON), the researchers have established two observatories of landscape-level carbon, water and energy balances at Imnaviat Creek, Alaska and at Pleistocene Park near Cherskii, Russia. These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system.

Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The AON research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00052-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"In 1980-1982, six transplant gardens were established along a latitudinal gradient in interior Alaska from Eagle Creek, AK, in the south to Prudhoe Bay, AK, in the north (Shaver et al. 1986) .Three sites, Toolik Lake (TL), Sagwon (SAG), and Prudhoe Bay (PB) are north of the continental divide and the remaining three, Eagle Creek (EC), No Name Creek (NN), and Coldfoot (CF), are south of the continental divide. Each garden consisted of 10 individual tussocks transplanted back to their home-site, as well as 10 individuals from each of the other transplant sites (n = 10; 6 populations x 6 sites x 10 replicates = 360 total individuals). Temperature response curves for Rd were measured in situ between 9:00 am and 6:00 pm with portable photosynthesis equipment fitted with an expanded temperature control kit (Li-Cor 6400 and Li-Cor 6400-88, Li-Cor, Inc, Lincoln, USA). For each replicate, a selection of E. vaginatum leaves per tussock (3–9) was used. The mean ± SD leaf temperatures (Tleaf) ranged between 10 ± 2.0 ?C and 25 ± 1.9 ?C for each curve, and Rd measurements were taken at intervals of ~2.5 ?C and at every point 10 measurements were recorded. Each response curve took between 20 and 70 min, depending on how quickly the higher leaf chamber temperatures were reached. After the respiration measurements, the leaf samples were dried at 60 ?C to a constant weight, ground and analyzed for CHN with a Perkin-Elmer Series II 2400 CHNS/O Analyzer (LECO Corporation, USA) at the MBL in Woods Hole, MA. The response of Rd to Tleaf was fitted by regression using a modified Arrhenius equation (Lloyd and Taylor 1994; Griffin et al. 2002).The respiration data given here are the respiration data corrected to 10 °C with the acquired Q10 value. Notes: Funding for this research was provided by National Science Foundation grant ARC-0908936, with additional support from NSF-OPP 0807639.AMAX and RESP data are incorporated in a ms. submitted to Botany.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

A new station (#48) was established during 1998 (on Oct 1 1998) at a site designated as Savana (initially called Blue Springs. Station 49 was installed in the Five Points area in 1999 and named Five Points. Another new station was established in 2001 at a new core study site designated as Blue Grama and given a station ID number of 50. These data have been run through a filtering program which replaces all obviously out-of-range values with -999.000's and flags questionable values for checking by data manager."

Rio Salado Grassland and Rio Salado Larrea are two study sites established in 1989. These sites were established as counterparts to sites at Five Points. Between 1989 and 1998, vegetation, litter decomposition, and ground dwelling arthropod and rodent populations were studied at both sites. Core studies at these sites were largely terminated in 1998, although rodent populations are still monitored at the Rio Salado Larrea site as the Small Mammal Exclosure Study's Larrea plots are co-located there. Rio Salado Grassland is the location of Met Station 44. The Rio Salado study sites are accessed by taking the San Acacia exit, going west and then taking the frontage road back north to the Sevilleta NWR gate.  After entering the refuge turn left after 0.2 mi and take this road 1.4 mi to a 'T' in the road at the power lines.  An earthen berm stops road travel here and the met station is located about 300 m west on the blocked road.   Vegetation: The Rio Salado Grassland site is Plains-Mesa Sand Scrub habitat characterized by stabilized deep-sand dominated by coppice dunes of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Co-dominant shrubs are sand sagebrush (Artemesia filifolia) and fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), with winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), Mormon tea (Ephedra torreyana), broom indigobush (Psorothamnus scoparius), soapweed yucca (Yucca glauca), and broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae) as other notable shrubs. One-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) is present as well, especially along shallow washes. Compared to the Black Grama Core Site, grass cover is sparse and dominated by poverty threeawn (Aristida divaricata), Indian ricegrass (Oryzopsis hymenoides), mesa and spike dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus and S. contractus), as well as patches of black grama (Bouteloua eriopoda). Notable forbs included spectaclepod (Dimorphocarpa wislizenii), tansy aster (Machaeranthera tanacetifolia), desert marigold (Baileya multiradiata), Abert buckwheat (Eriogonum abertianum), dwarf gilia (Ipomopsis pumila), rattlesnake weed (Chamaesyce albomarginata), blunt tansymustard (Descarania obtusa), plains hiddenflower (Cryptantha crassisepala), and Rocky Mountain zinnia (Zinnia grandiflora)., siteid: 13 -106.9267 -106.9267 34.269 34.269 1503 1503 meter"

Shrubs are uncommon but those that occur include Yucca glauca, Ephedra torreyi, and four-wing saltbush (Atriplex canescens). Herbaceous plants include Plantago purshii, Hymenopappus filifolius, and globe mallows (Sphaeralcea spp.). , -106.7358 -106.7358 34.3592 34.3592 1600 1600 meter"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, and OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, and OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

At the permafrost-thaw gradient site permafrost temperature has been monitored annually in a 30-m-deep borehole since1985, before the permafrost started to thaw. There are two experimental warming treatments at the CiPEHR project: Soil warming (previously referred to as winter warming: WW) increases soil temperature and ground thaw using snow fences; Air warming (previously referred to as summer warming: SW) increases growing season air temperature using open top chambers. The warming treatments are applied in a blocked split-plot design to evaluate the seperate and combined effects of winter and summer warming. In late September 2012, 24 PVC chambers (10 cm diameter, 0.86 L average volume) were installed 10 cm into the soil of the control and WW experimental plots and remained in place for the entire winter. Each chamber was placed close (within 1m) to a soil temperature and soil moisture probe. An open piece of tubing was installed next to the chambers to measure ambient CO2 under the snowpack. To eliminate disturbance of the snowpack, this tubing, along with tubing from the chambers, extended to an off-plot location. Methods During sampling, the CO2 concentration in the snowpack directly next to the chamber was determined using a Li-820 infrared gas analyzer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA; hereafter referred to as IRGA). The CO2 concentration within the chamber was then measured and scrubbed down to the ambient snowpack concentration using soda lime, at which point flux measurement began. Air was circulated between the chamber and the IRGA at 1L min-1 and the CO2 concentration was recorded every 2 seconds for 15 minutes. All chamber measurements were performed in low wind (< 8 ms^-1) conditions. geoReference 2012-10-27 2013-05-15 Sampling Frequency Irregular: sampled when personnel was at field site and when field conditions allowed."

00056-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design The study site at the Eight Mile Lake (EML) watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. While permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding, depending on local topography, this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands. The CiPEHR experiments were established in 2008 to complement research along a natural permafrost thaw gradient, at an adjacent site. At the permafrost-thaw gradient site permafrost temperature has been monitored annually in a 30-m-deep borehole since1985, before the permafrost started to thaw. There are two experimental warming treatments at the CiPEHR project: Soil warming (previously referred to as winter warming: WW) increases soil temperature and ground thaw using snow fences; Air warming (previously referred to as summer warming: SW) increases growing season air temperature using open top chambers. The warming treatments are applied in a blocked split-plot design to evaluate the seperate and combined effects of winter and summer warming. In late September 2012, 24 PVC chambers (10 cm diameter, 0.86 L average volume) were installed 10 cm into the soil of the control and WW experimental plots and remained in place for the entire winter.

In short, the first and second derivatives of the CO2 concentration vs. time curve were determined using a brute force method. To obtain the first derivative, we analyzed a moving window of 120 points. A time zero (T0), the first derivative was the slope of the line through all points from T0 to T120. At T1, the first derivative was the slope of the linethrough all points from T1 to T121 and so on. To obtain the second derivative, we used the same method but with a 300 second window, as applying a shorter window made the curve too rough for analysis. After we obtained the second derivatives, we recorded the flux (the first derivative, slope of initial curve in ppm/s) at the point where the second derivative leveled off near zero. We then used pv=nrt to convert from ppm/(s*m^2) to umolesCO2/(m^2*s). Status Ongoing"

00058-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In contribution to the Arctic Observing Network (AON), the researchers have established two observatories of landscape-level carbon, water and energy balances at Imnavait Creek, Alaska and at Pleistocene Park near Cherskii, Russia. These will form part of a network of observatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interaction with the global system.In support of these objectives, a 3m eddy covariance station was established on a low ridge adjacent to Imnavait Creek, Alaska. This station has been continuously monitoring carbon dioxide, water vapor, energy fluxes and various micrometeorological variables."

00058-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected.This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.See the file IC_1991_Metadata_2007.csv for data collection statistics.

00058-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected.This station uses a CR3000 data logger and a laptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Micrometeorological data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all data points are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the data logger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis.The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data:1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range.2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceeds a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered.3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (i.e. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.)5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Data loggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'.6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers.7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered.The following procedures are used to gap-till the data:1) A Pth order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (i.e. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.See the file IC_1991_Metadata_2007.csv for data collection statistics.

These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system.

Sanborn Maps for 1900-1949 were available through the ProQuest Digital Sanborn Maps database; Sanborn Maps for 1963 were derived from original scans of a microfilm available through the Arizona State University Libraries Map Collection. For each year, clipped a 2002 Maricopa Assessor parcel feature class to the Sanborn Fire Insurance Map coverage for 1915 (roughly Phoenix’s 1915 incorporated boundary). Modified the feature class to include a historical land-use field. Using the ArcGIS Editor Toolbar, for each year (working backwards from 1949 and later adding 1963) merged and cut parcel boundaries as delimited by the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps. Assigned a land-use to each parcel based on classification scheme land-use types (see table). Recorded notes of nonconforming or atypical mixtures of features observed on parcels for future reclassification (as needed). For each year, created a secondary land-use field (“Compat_RC”) to generalize land-use into five categories for spatial analysis. Repaired parcel geometry and removed spurious “sliver” polygons; removed extraneous fields."

The Kuparuk River data is maintained by Dough Kane on the Water and Environmental Research Center at UAF (http://www.uaf.edu/water/projects/NorthSlope/upper_kuparuk/uk_river/uk_river.html) Stream height is converted into stream discharge based on a rating curve calculated from manual discharge measurements throughout the season. The principal investigator in charge of the temperature and discharge measurements is Dr. Breck Bowden."

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00061-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Methods:  Georectification and initial classification were performed by Guofan Shao in 1994 using ERDAS 7.5 and ARC/INFO software.  An updated classification, based in part on the earlier one, was performed by David Richardson in 2014 using ERDAS IMAGINE 2013 and ArcGIS 10.1 software. The original satellite image was georectified using ERDAS to 30 meter resolution with a positional accuracy of about 20 meters (RMS error 0.69 pixels).   The georectified image was SUBSET to include only the VA portion of the Delmarva Penninsula , and then ERDAS's ISODATA and MAXCLAS routines were used to perform an unsupervised classification using TM bands 4, 5, and 2 to create 50 spectral cluster classes.  Afterwards, the cluster classes were individually examined, and based on previous maps, aerial photos, and personal knowledge were assigned to one of 5 predetermined classes (Forest/shrub, Bareland/sand, Crop/grassland, Water, or Salt Marsh) using ERDAS's COLORMOD and RECODE routines.  The GIS file was then converted to an ARC/INFO coverage.  Then in ARC/INFO clusters of individual cells less than 1/3 ha (3600 square meters or 4 pixels) in area were ELIMINATED and DISOLVED to get rid of 'salt and pepper' noise and to make the number of arcs and polygons not exceed the limits of ARC/INFO for the whole map. This initial classification formed the basis for the 1993 Northampton-only 'Landuse and Vegetation Map' (part of the 1995 Northampton County Virginia Geographic Information system, VCRLTER dataset VCR14219).  It was also used in a shoreline change analysis (Shao et al. 1995) and featured in a number of printed and online maps from the VCRLTER. A second updated classification was later performed to facilitate future landscape-scale change detection analyses and to replicate for archiving the data north of Northampton County, as the original full VCR dataset is no longer available. In the updated classification, the original georectified TM image was reclassified using the ISODATA routine into 150 spectral clusters using all seven TM bands. These cluster classes were again individually examined using the previous classification, false-color infrared and true-color aerial photos, and personal knowledge, and then each class was assigned to one of eleven distinguishable classes.  These eleven classes were hierarchically grouped into the original five classes based on vegetative properties and similarities in aerial coverage.  Pixels belonging to 10 of the spectral classes that were ambiguous and crossed class boundaries were subset from the georectified TM image and reclassified using ISODATA into 50 new spectral clusters.  The refined clusters were reassigned to the appropriate one of eleven classes.  Unlike in the original classification, no additional generalization or elimination based on minimum area thresholds was conducted.  Reclassification of the resulting classified images and conversion from raster to vector format was carried out in ArcGIS 10.1. LANDUSE/LANDCOVER CLASSES: Unclassified (0) 0 = Nodata Water (1,2) 1 = Open water 2 = Shallow open water, tidal flats and bars Salt Marsh (3) 3 = Salt marsh Grassland/Cropland (4,5) 4 = Brackish (upper/high) marsh, freshwater marsh (including cattails), wet grassland, irrigated cropland 5 = Grassland, cropland, lawns, some areas of reed (Phragmites) marsh Forest/Shrub (6,7,8,9) 6 = Shrubby/scrub marsh, shrub-cedar thicket/forest transition zone (ecotone) 7 = Evergreen forest (predominantly pine and/or red cedar) 8 = Mixed forest (mostly pine-hardwood), dense Myrica-dominated shrub thickets 9 = Deciduous (hardwood)  forest Bare Sand and Soil (10,11) 10 = Wet sand, exposed shoals and mud flats 11 = Bare sand and soil (beaches, shell, tilled cropland, other unvegetated areas) Classification Accuracy: Artificial man-made surfaces like asphalt and concrete pavement and tarred roofs may be included in classes 3, 10, and 11 depending on how dark or reflective they are as well as whether or not they take up one or more full pixels. Spectral mixing of signatures for subpixel-scale objects and patches (<900 square meters) may result in incorrect classification of highly heterogeneous landscapes, including largely residential and commercial areas as well as inter-fingered marsh/shrub/forest ecotones on barrier islands. A quantitative accuracy assessment was conducted comparing the final classification to landcover field data collected at permanent monitoring plots on Parramore Island in 1996 (VCRLTER dataset VCR05117).  Field data land cover classes were converted to TM classes as follows: PARR water (10) and mudflat (14) = TM Water (1,2) PARR low (1) and upper salt marsh (2) = TM Salt Marsh (3) PARR salt hay meadow (3) and grassland (11) = TM Grassland/Cropland (4,5) PARR shrub/reed marsh (4), evergreen/hardwood/mixed forest (5/6/7), Myrica/Smilax thicket (8/12) = TM Forest/Shrub (6,7,8,9) PARR bare sand (11) = TM Bare Sand and Soil (10,11) The 1996 landcover plots were located at the center of each monitoring plot and at distances of 7.5, 15, 30, and 60 m. from the center in the four cardinal directions (0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees).  Excluding landcover plots with no data and treating landcover plots as if they were independent samples, there were 1794 landcover plots associated with 106 permanent monitoring plots.  Landcover plot locations were mapped with ArcGIS and overlaid onto the classified TM image.  Pixels and plots were considered coincident and in agreement if a pixel edge with the same classification as the plot was no more than 30 meters distant from the landcover plot. A PDF document is included with the dataset showing the base error classification matrix with the overall accuracy and the commission/omission error rates associated with each landcover class and hierarchical grouping.  The PDF also contains the overall Kappa K-hat coefficient of agreement and the conditional K-hat coefficients for each class and grouping (Congalton et al. 1983, Jensen 2005).  In summary, on Parramore Island there was relatively strong overall agreement between the TM classification and the field data (68% agreement, K-hat 0.62), which improved if only the hierarchical groupings were considered (79% agreement, K-hat 0.70).  The agreement was quite strong for the water, salt marsh, and forest/thicket classes (conditional K-hats of 0.94, 0.89, and 0.90), moderate for beach and bare sand (0.56), and weak for the brackish marsh/grassland category.  Disagreement within the high marsh zone was primarily driven by the failure of the TM classification to adequately capture numerous small-scale patches or linear shrub features, primarily Iva and/or Myrica hummocks and ecotones.  Some disagreement may also be due to the lumping of Phragmities and Typha marshes with shrubby marsh in the field data but with grasslands in the TM data.  Disagreement within open sand areas was possibly largely due to shore erosion and beach encroachment during the three years between the time of the satellite overflight and the field data collection, though failure to capture narrow strips of open sand in the relic dune areas on the north end of the island also contributed. A qualitative assessment of the full region covered found good agreement except for the following case: Brackish and freshwater areas within the extensive marshes on the bayside surrounding Messongo Creek and the Pocomoke and Big Annemessex Rivers in the northern region of the study area, especially the freshwater marshes along the Pocomoke River, were particularly difficult to distinguish spectrally from the woody shrub and forest classes.  Similar misclassification patterns were observed in this region near Saxis, VA, in the original classification.  As a result, confidence in the classification accuracy of brackish and freshwater marshes in this region is low. The exact cause for the poorer differentiation of open non-woody brackish and freshwater marshes in the northern bayside region is unknown.  One possibility is that these areas had a higher abundance of broadleaf herbaceous freshwater wetland species than in the other geographic regions and that the spectral characteristics of these species shifted the overall spectral signature there to be more similar to broadleaf shrub and tree palustrine woodlands.  Another possible explanation for the spectral differences of these marshes compared to the seaside and southern bayside marshes is that these marshes were captured at an entirely different stage of tidal inundation.  The occurrence of peak high and low tides falls within a two to three hour window for the region stretching from Chincoteague Inlet to Fishermans Island to Cape Charles Harbor, with tidal stage progressing from north to south along the Atlantic coast and then continuing from south to north along the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  The tides at Wachapreague and Redbank occur within the center of this window.  This means that while most marshes in the image were observed relatively close to low tide, the marshes around Gaskins Point and Occohannock Creek were observed at close to high tide, and the marshes around Saxis were observed about 1.5-2 hours before high tide (possibly when the time since inundation and wetting of the surface would have been greatest for upper areas of the marsh subject to regular inundation). "

A PDF document is included with the dataset showing the base error classification matrix with the overall accuracy and the commission/omission error rates associated with each landcover class and hierarchical grouping.  The PDF also contains the overall Kappa K-hat coefficient of agreement and the conditional K-hat coefficients for each class and grouping (Congalton et al. 1983, Jensen 2005).  In summary, on Parramore Island there was relatively strong overall agreement between the TM classification and the field data (68% agreement, K-hat 0.62), which improved if only the hierarchical groupings were considered (79% agreement, K-hat 0.70).  The agreement was quite strong for the water, salt marsh, and forest/thicket classes (conditional K-hats of 0.94, 0.89, and 0.90), moderate for beach and bare sand (0.56), and weak for the brackish marsh/grassland category.  Disagreement within the high marsh zone was primarily driven by the failure of the TM classification to adequately capture numerous small-scale patches or linear shrub features, primarily Iva and/or Myrica hummocks and ecotones.  Some disagreement may also be due to the lumping of Phragmities and Typha marshes with shrubby marsh in the field data but with grasslands in the TM data.  Disagreement within open sand areas was possibly largely due to shore erosion and beach encroachment during the three years between the time of the satellite overflight and the field data collection, though failure to capture narrow strips of open sand in the relic dune areas on the north end of the island also contributed. A qualitative assessment of the full region covered found good agreement except for the following case: Brackish and freshwater areas within the extensive marshes on the bayside surrounding Messongo Creek and the Pocomoke and Big Annemessex Rivers in the northern region of the study area, especially the freshwater marshes along the Pocomoke River, were particularly difficult to distinguish spectrally from the woody shrub and forest classes.  Similar misclassification patterns were observed in this region near Saxis, VA, in the original classification.  As a result, confidence in the classification accuracy of brackish and freshwater marshes in this region is low. The exact cause for the poorer differentiation of open non-woody brackish and freshwater marshes in the northern bayside region is unknown.  One possibility is that these areas had a higher abundance of broadleaf herbaceous freshwater wetland species than in the other geographic regions and that the spectral characteristics of these species shifted the overall spectral signature there to be more similar to broadleaf shrub and tree palustrine woodlands.  Another possible explanation for the spectral differences of these marshes compared to the seaside and southern bayside marshes is that these marshes were captured at an entirely different stage of tidal inundation.  The occurrence of peak high and low tides falls within a two to three hour window for the region stretching from Chincoteague Inlet to Fishermans Island to Cape Charles Harbor, with tidal stage progressing from north to south along the Atlantic coast and then continuing from south to north along the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  The tides at Wachapreague and Redbank occur within the center of this window.  This means that while most marshes in the image were observed relatively close to low tide, the marshes around Gaskins Point and Occohannock Creek were observed at close to high tide, and the marshes around Saxis were observed about 1.5-2 hours before high tide (possibly when the time since inundation and wetting of the surface would have been greatest for upper areas of the marsh subject to regular inundation). "

00063-metadata.xml,Related Resource Citation,/eml:eml/dataset/project,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project III Merryl Alber principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER is located along three adjacent sounds on the Atlantic coast and includes both intertidal marshes and estuaries. Long-term drivers of climate change, sea level rise and human alterations of the landscape will cause transitions in dominant habitat types (state changes) within the GCE domain by changing the amounts and patterns of water delivery across the landscape. These changes in water delivery can be conceptualized as presses and pulses in river inflow, local runoff, groundwater input, and tidal inundation, which will in turn manifest themselves as changes in salinity and inundation patterns in the domain. The research proposed for GCE-III is designed to address how variations in salinity and inundation, driven by climate change and anthropogenic factors, affect biotic and ecosystem responses at different spatial and temporal scales, and to predict the consequences of these changes for habitat provisioning and carbon (C) sequestration across the coastal landscape. The goals are to: 1) Track long-term changes in climate and human actions in the watershed and adjacent uplands, and evaluate the effects of these drivers on domain boundary conditions. 2) Describe temporal and spatial variability in physical, chemical, geological and biological, and to evaluate how they are affected by variations in river inflow and other boundary conditions. 3) Characterize the responses of three dominant habitats in the domain to pulses and presses in salinity and inundation. 4) Describe patterns of habitat provisioning and C sequestration and export in the GCE domain, and to evaluate how these might be affected by changes in salinity and inundation. These efforts will be synthesized into a synoptic understanding of both biotic and ecosystem responses to variations in salinity and inundation driven by climate change and human activities, which will be used to assess thresholds between habitats and the potential for state changes in the domain.

00063-metadata.xml,Project Description,/eml:eml/dataset/project,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project III Merryl Alber principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER is located along three adjacent sounds on the Atlantic coast and includes both intertidal marshes and estuaries. Long-term drivers of climate change, sea level rise and human alterations of the landscape will cause transitions in dominant habitat types (state changes) within the GCE domain by changing the amounts and patterns of water delivery across the landscape. These changes in water delivery can be conceptualized as presses and pulses in river inflow, local runoff, groundwater input, and tidal inundation, which will in turn manifest themselves as changes in salinity and inundation patterns in the domain. The research proposed for GCE-III is designed to address how variations in salinity and inundation, driven by climate change and anthropogenic factors, affect biotic and ecosystem responses at different spatial and temporal scales, and to predict the consequences of these changes for habitat provisioning and carbon (C) sequestration across the coastal landscape. The goals are to: 1) Track long-term changes in climate and human actions in the watershed and adjacent uplands, and evaluate the effects of these drivers on domain boundary conditions. 2) Describe temporal and spatial variability in physical, chemical, geological and biological, and to evaluate how they are affected by variations in river inflow and other boundary conditions. 3) Characterize the responses of three dominant habitats in the domain to pulses and presses in salinity and inundation. 4) Describe patterns of habitat provisioning and C sequestration and export in the GCE domain, and to evaluate how these might be affected by changes in salinity and inundation. These efforts will be synthesized into a synoptic understanding of both biotic and ecosystem responses to variations in salinity and inundation driven by climate change and human activities, which will be used to assess thresholds between habitats and the potential for state changes in the domain.

00064-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This study aims to explore the interplay between biofilms and erodability of cohesive sediments. Erosion experiments were run in four laboratory annular flumes with natural sediments. Mud from the Rowley River mudflats was taken at low tide and then placed in flumes. Two of the flumes were bleach to prevent biota, while the other two were allowed to grow; nutrients were also added to the flumes. On different intervals, the flumes were eroded and the amount of erosion and velocity of the flow were measured. Additionally, each day biofilm growth was measured using Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM) Underwater Fluorometry. Reported here are 10 minute averages of shear stress (derived from velocity) and suspended sediment (uncalibrated, in NTUs) along with PAM measurements. The complete dataset is available upon request via .mat files, but the dataset is quite large (kendallv@bu.edu or pie_im@mbl.edu)."

00064-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Sediment was collected from the mudflats on the Rowley River, was sieved through a #10 sieve, and then was frozen at -18 C for 12 hours. Sediment was then thawed and placed in flumes. Flumes had lights over them with a 24 hour light/dark cycle. A water column of saline water was placed over the sediment. Flumes 1 and 2 were bleached to attempt to kill remaining biota. Nutrients were added daily to each flume. For description of the flume, see Valentine et al. (2014). For erosion experiments, a propeller was placed in the flume. The propeller started at a low velocity and increased velocity every 10 minutes for a total of 80 minutes. Then the propeller was removed from the flume and the sediment was allowed to settle. During erosion experiments, an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter and Optical Backscatter Sensor were deployed in the flume to measure velocity and suspended sediment. Velocity was used to calculate shear stress using the Reynolds shear stress equation. Daily, 10 Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM) Underwater Fluorometer measurements were taken in the flumes and were calibrated to chlorophyll a samples taken from the flumes. For the data uploaded here, shear stress and suspended sediment are reported as 10 minutes averages.

00066-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Urban growth models have increasingly been used by planners and policy makers to visualize, organize, understand, and predict urban growth. However, these models reveal a wide disparity in their attention to policy factors. Some urban growth models capture few if any specific policy effects (e.g.,as model variables), while others integrate certain policies but not others. Since zoning policies are the most widely used form of land use control in the United States, their conspicuous absence from so many urban growth models is surprising. This research investigated the impacts of zoning on urban growth by calibrating and simulating a cellular automaton urban growth model, SLEUTH, under two conditions in a South Florida location. The first condition integrated restrictive agricultural zoning into SLEUTH, while the other ignored zoning data. Goodness of fit metrics indicate that including the agricultural zoning data improved model performance. The results further suggest that agricultural zoning has been somewhat successful in retarding urban growth in South Florida. Ignoring zoning information is detrimental to SLEUTH performance in particular, and urban growth modeling in general."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Fire scars were mapped by the Alaska Fire Service and their locations acquired from the Alaska Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management 2012). Within each mid-successional fire scar, we located forest stands of varying deciduous dominance using a combination of satellite imagery depicting deciduous versus evergreen cover (Beck et al. 2011) and ground observations. Our goal was to find at least three stands per fire scar ranging from predominantly coniferous to predominantly deciduous canopy composition that could have originated following fire within a stand previously dominated by black spruce. However, this was not always possible, and some fire scars have only one stand or two or more stands with similar canopy composition. We also sampled mature black spruce (based on T. Hollingsworth sampling sites) and deciduous stands (often paired to a nearby mature black spruce stand). We assessed the possibility of black spruce origination by looking for fire-killed stems, stumps, and logs of black spruce, regenerating black spruce in the understory, and by avoiding southeast facing slopes, where black spruce typically does not grow. Fire-killed black spruce were differentiated from white spruce (P. glauca) based on size, location of cones, and twig morphology. We also avoided sampling poorly-drained black spruce stands, which have a longer burn return interval and rarely transition to other tree species.

00068-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Toxic cyanobacterial blooms threaten freshwaters worldwide but have proven difficult to predict because the mechanisms of bloom formation and toxin production are unknown, especially on weekly time scales. Water quality management continues to focus on aggregated metrics, such as chlorophyll and total nutrients, which may not be sufficient to explain complex community changes and functions such as toxin production. For example, nitrogen (N) speciation and cycling play an important role, on daily time scales, in shaping cyanobacterial communities because declining N has been shown to select for N fixers. In addition, subsequent N pulses from N2 fixation may stimulate and sustain toxic cyanobacterial growth. Herein, we describe how rapid early summer declines in N followed by bursts of N fixation have shaped cyanobacterial communities in a eutrophic lake (Lake Mendota, Wisconsin, USA), possibly driving toxic Microcystis blooms throughout the growing season. On weekly time scales in 2010 and *2011, we monitored the cyanobacterial community in a eutrophic lake using the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) region to determine population dynamics. In parallel, we measured microcystin concentrations, N2 fixation rates, and potential environmental drivers that contribute to structuring the community."

00068-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field sample collection and processing At each location, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), and pH were collected at 1 m increments from the surface to the maximum depth (YSI 556MPS). Photic zone depth was defined at 1percent of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) as measured using a PAR sensor (LiCor 192SA). Integrated photic zone samples were then collected using a weighted 2-inch diameter polypropylene tube. Samples for DNA, nutrients, toxins, and pigment analyses were collected in acid-washed, sterile bottles, (rinsed three times with in situ water before collection) and stored on ice until further processing. Once transported back to the lab, samples were immediately processed. For dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), nitrate, and nitrite, 100 mL of water was filtered through a Whatman glass fiber filter (GForF) and frozen at -20 degreeC. For TP and total nitrogen (TN), HCl was added to 100mL of sample to a final concentration of 0.1percent and stored at -20 degreeC. Ammonium samples were immediately measured to avoid oxidation during freezing. Chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin samples were collected onto GForF filters and stored in black tubes at -20 degreeC. For community analysis (DNA), samples were filtered onto 0.2 µm polyethersulfone membrane filters (Supor-200; Pall Corporation) and frozen at -20 degreeC until extraction. 20 mL of unfiltered water was preserved in formalin (3percent final concentration) and stored at room temperature in the dark for microscopy. An additional 50 mL of unfiltered water was stored at -20 degreeC for toxin analysis. Analytical measurements DRP was measured by the ascorbic acid-molybdenum blue method 4500 P E (Greenberg et al. 1992). Ammonium was measured spectrophotometrically (Solórzano 1969). Nitrate and nitrite were measured individually using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Flowers et al. 2009). TPorTDP and TNorTDN were digested as previously described (White et al. 2010), prior to analysis as for DRP and nitrate. For TDN and TN, the resulting solution was oxidized completely to nitrate and was measured via HPLC as above. Nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium were summed and reported as dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). Phycocyanin was extracted in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) following three freeze-thaw cycles at -20 ºC and on ice, respectively. The extract was centrifuged and then measured spectrophotometrically at 620 nm with correction at 650 nm (Demarsac and Houmard 1988). Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) was extracted overnight at -20 ºC in 90percent acetone and then measured spectrophotometrically with acid correction (Tett et al. 1975). For toxin analysis, whole water samples were lyophilized, resuspended in 5percent acetic acid, separated by solid phase extraction (SPE; Bond Elut C18 column, Varian), and eluted in 50percent methanol as previously described (Harada et al. 1988). Microcystin (MC) variants of leucine (L), arginine (R), and tyrosine (Y) were detected and quantified at the Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene (SLOH) using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectroscopy (API 3200, MSorMS) after separation by HPLC (Eaglesham et al. 1999). We report only MCLR concentrations since MCYR and MCRR were near the limit of quantification for the sampling period (0.01 µg L-1). In situ N2 fixation measurements N2 fixation rates were measured, with some modifications, following the acetylene reduction assay (Stewart et al. 1967). A fresh batch of acetylene was generated each day before sampling by combing 1 g of calcium carbide (Sigma Aldrich 270296) with 100 mL ddH2O. Following sample collection, 1 L of water was concentrated by gentle filtration onto a 47 mm GForF filter in the field. The filter was then gently washed into a 25 mL serum bottle using the lake water filtrate (final volumes 10 mL aqueous, 15 mL gas). Samples were spiked with 1 mL of acetylene gas and incubated in situ for two hours. The assay was terminated with 5percent final concentration trichloracetic acid and serum bottles were transported back to the lab. For each sampling period, rates were controlled and corrected for using a series of the following incubated acetylene blanks: 1) 1 mL of acetylene in filtrate alone, 2) 1 mL of acetylene in a killed sample, and 3) 1 mL of acetylene in ddH2O. Ethylene formed was measured by a gas chromatograph (GC; Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID), Porapak N column (80or100 mesh, 1or8OD x 6), and integrator (Hewlett Packard 3396) with N2 as the carrier gas (25 mL min-1 flow rate). Molar N2 fixation rates were estimated using a 1:4 ratio of N2 fixed to ethylene formed (Jensen and Cox 1983). All N2 fixation values are reported as integrated photic zone rates of µg N L-1 hr-1. DNA extraction and processing of PC-IGS fragment DNA was extracted from frozen filters using a xanthogenate-phenol-chloroform protocol previously described (Miller and McMahon 2011). For amplification of the phycocyanin intergenic spacer (PC-IGS) region, we used primers PCalphaR (5-CCAGTACCACCAGCAACTAA-3) and PCbetaF (5-GGCTGCTTGTTTACGCGACA-3, 6-FAM-labelled) and PCR conditions that were previously described (Neilan et al. 1995). Briefly, each 50 µl reaction mixture contained 5 µl of 10X buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), 2.5 µl of dNTPs (5 mM), 2 µl of forward and reverse primers (10 µM), 2 µl of template DNA, and 0.5 µl of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U µl-1). Following precipitation with ammonium acetate and isopropanol, the DNA pellet was resuspended in ddH2O and digested for 2 hrs at 37 ºC using the MspI restriction enzyme, BSA, and Buffer B (Promega, Madison, WI). The digested product was precipitated and then resuspended in 20 µL of ddH2O. 2 µL of final product was combined with 10 µL of formamide and 0.4 µL of a custom carboxy-x-rhodamine (ROX) size standard (BioVentures, Inc). Cyanobacterial PC-IGS community fingerprinting and cell counts We analyzed the cyanobacterial community using an automated phycocyanin intergenic spacer analysis (APISA) similar to the automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) previously described (Yannarell et al. 2003). Briefly, this cyanobacterial-specific analysis exploits the variable PC-IGS region of the phycocyanin operon (Neilan et al. 1995). Following MspI digestion, the variable lengths of the PC-IGS fragment can be used to identify subgenus level taxonomic units of the larger cyanobacterial community (Miller and McMahon 2011). The MspI fragments were sized using denaturing capillary electrophoresis (ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer; University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center (UWBC)). For each sample, triplicate electropherogram profiles were analyzed using GeneMarker® (SoftGenetics) software v 1.5. In addition, a script developed in the R Statistics Environment was used to distinguish potential peaks from baseline noise (Jones and McMahon 2009, Jones et al. 2012). Relative abundance data output from this script were created using the relative proportion of fluorescence each peak height contributed per sample. Aligned, overlapping peaks were binned into subgenus taxonomic units (Miller and McMahon 2011). These taxa were named based on the genus and base pair length of the PC-IGS fragment identified (e.g. For Mic215, Mic = Microcystis and 215 = 215 base pair fragment). Fragment lengths were matched to an in silico digested database of PC-IGS sequences using the Phylogenetic Assignment Tool (https:ororsecure.limnology.wisc.eduortrflpor). The NTL-LTER program collects biweekly phytoplankton samples between April and September for cell counts and detailed descriptions of the field and laboratory protocols are available online at http:ororlter.limnology.wisc.edu. When indicated, biomass has been converted to mg L-1 using the biovolume calculated during the cell count process and assuming a density equivalent to water.  "

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W.

Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

00072-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"We measured the trophic transfer of secondary consumer biomass from the Everglades marshes to the oligohaline reaches of the Shark River by sampling the diets of four common large bodied piscivorous fishes occurring at the marsh-estuary oligohaline ecotone. The four species sampled were Florida bass (Micropterus floridanus), bowfin (Amia calva), common snook (Centropomus undecimalis), and red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus). We sampled diets via pulsed gastric lavage, a relatively non-lethal and effective sampling technique used to measure trophic interactions. We quantified trophic transfer of marsh biomass to the estuary when a focal piscivore consumed a prey species that was likely a migrant from adjacent marshes. A more detailed description of these methods can be found in citation #28. In the presented data, we combined estimates of relative abundance of piscivores from standardized electrofishing techniques (# of piscivores/ 100 meters of sampled shoreline) with biomass of marsh species consumed in the estuary to calculate the biomass (g) transferred to the estuary per 100 meters of shoreline. These values serve as our index of how much biomass is being exported off of the marsh to the estuary through consumer mediated habitat linkages. An important key finding from this work is that disturbance, in particular drought, can sever this biomass linkage, and conserve biomass export off of karstic wetlands to estuaries through of marsh secondary consumer trophic pathways."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

The McMurdo Dry Valleys of South Victoria Land, Antarctica, contain numerous glacial meltwater streams that drain into lakes on the valley floors. Many of the streams have abundant perennial mats of filamentous cyanobacteria. The algal mats grow during streamflow in the austral summer and are in a dormant freeze-dried state during the rest of the year. NO3 and soluble reactive P (SRP) concentrations were lower in streams with abundant algal mats than in streams with sparse algal mats. NO3 and SRP concentrations were higher in the hyporheic zone of a stream with abundant algal mats than in the stream itself. An experimental injection of LiCl, NaNO3, and K3PO4 was conducted in Green Creek, which has abundant algal mats. Substantial hyporheic exchange occurred. The NO3 and PO4 concentrations at 50 m below the injection were 55 μM and 18 μM, respectively, during the experiment. NO3 and PO4 concentrations were below the detection limit of 1 to 2 μM at a site 497 m below the injection during the Cl tracer arrival, indicating a high capacity for nutrient uptake by algal communities. NO2 and NH4 were present at sites 226 and 327 m below the injection, indicating that, in addition to denitrification and algal uptake, dissimilatory NO3 reduction to NO2 and NH4 may be a NO3 sink during transport. Transport modelling with nutrient uptake represented as a 1st-order process yielded reach-scale parameters of 4.3 × 10−5 to 3.9 × 10−4/s and 1.4 × 10−4 to 3.8 × 10−4/s for uptake of NO3 and PO4, respectively. The best match with the observed data was a model in which PO4 uptake occurred only in the main channel and NO3 uptake occurred in the main channel and in the hyporheic zone. Hyporheic NO3 uptake was 7 to 16% of the total uptake for the different stream reaches. These results demonstrate that nutrient flux to the lakes is controlled by hyporheic exchange and nutrient uptake by algal mats in dry valley streams. Streams without algal mats contribute more nutrients to the lakes than streams with algal mats."

00074-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Field data collection A continuous tracer injection containing K3PO4, NaNO3 and LiCl was initiated on January 13, 1995. Water samples were collected at 4 locations downstream (50, 226, 327, and 497 m downstream of the injection).. Field sample analysis Nutrient samples were analyzed using a Lachat Quickchem autoanalyzer with a detection limit of 0.04 uM. Samples were analyzed for lithium and chloride using a atomic absorption spectrometer and a ion chromatograph, respectively. Model approach Physical transport parameters were developed by fitting an advection-dispersion-storage model to observed chloride breakthrough curves. First-order uptake rate coefficients were subsequently developed by fitting an advection-dispersion-storage-uptake model to the N and P data. Modeling code used Study consisted of both flow and transport modeling. A kinematic wave model based on DR3M was used to develop a time-series of flow and cross-sectional area. These time series were used as input to the OTIS solute transport model. The routing model is not publically available (although DR3M is at http://water.usgs.gov/software/DR3M/ ); OTIS is available at: http://water.usgs.gov/software/OTIS/ OTIS Model input files: These input files are hard to describe using structured metadata constructs from EML or ISO. We provided copies in a zip file in the other entities section of this metadata. Flow routing input files are not available. Flow routing input files are not available. dr3m - Distributed Routing Rainfall-Runoff Model--version II W.M. Alley P.E. Smith D.R. Dawdy 1982 DR3M is a watershed model for routing storm runoff through a Branched system of pipes and (or) natural channels using rainfall as input. DR3M provides detailed simulation of storm-runoff period selected by the user. There is daily soil-moisture accounting between storms. A drainage basin is represented as a set of overland-flow, channel, and reservoir segments, which jointly describe the drainage features of the basin. This model is usually used to simulate small urban basins. Interflow and base flow are not simulated. Snow accumulation and snowmelt are not simulated. How to install DR3M http://water.usgs.gov/software/DR3M/code/UNIX/README citation Alley, W.M., and Smith, P.E., 1982, Distributed routing rainfall-runoff model--version II: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 82-344, 201 p. Method The rainfall-excess components include soil-moisture accounting, pervious-area rainfall excess, impervious-area rainfall excess, and parameter optimization. The Green-Ampt equation is used in the calculations of infiltration and pervious area rainfall excess. A Rosenbrock optimization procedure may be used to aid in calibrating several of the infiltration and soil-moisture accounting parameters. Kinematic wave theory is used for both overland-flow and channel routing. There are three solution techniques available: method of characteristics, implicit finite difference method, and explicit finite difference method. Two soil types may be defined. Overland flow may be defined as turbulent or laminar. Detention reservoirs may be simulated as linear storage or using a modified-Puls method. Channel segments may be defined as gutter, pipe, triangular cross section, or by explicitly specifying the kinematic channel parameters alpha and m. History DR3M-version II, added option to output simulated time-series data to Watershed Data Management (WDM) file. Output file modified to reduce width from 132 characters to 80 characters or less. DR3M-version II, WDM file replaces 'card' input of time-series data. 1982 - DR3M-version II, added two solution techniques for kinematic wave routing. Improved general output. 1978 - Original DR3M version, incorporated the routing component from a version of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology catchment model into the lumped parameter rainfall-runoff model. 1972 - A lumped parameter rainfall-runoff model for small rural watersheds DATA REQUIREMENTS Daily precipitation, daily evapotranspiration, and short-interval precipitation are required. Short-interval discharge is required for the optimization option and to calibrate the model. These time series are read from a WDM file. Roughness and hydraulics parameters and sub-catchment areas are required to define the basin. Six parameters are required to calculate infiltration and soil-moisture accounting. Up to three rainfall stations may be used.Two soil types may be defined. A total of 99 flow planes, channels, pipes, reservoirs, and junctions may be used to define the basin. OUTPUT OPTIONS The computed outflow from any flow plane, pipe, or channel segment for each storm period may be written to the output file or to the WDM file. A summary of the measured and simulated rainfall, runoff, and peak flows is written to the output file. A flat file containing the storm rainfall, measured flow (if available), and simulated flow at user selected sites can be generated. A flat file for each storm containing the total rainfall, the measured peak flow (if available), and the simulated peak flow for user-selected sites can be generated. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS DR3M is written in Fortran 77 with the following extension: use of include files. The UTIL, ADWDM, and WDM libraries from LIB are used. A subset of these libraries is provided with the code and may be used instead of the libraries, this subset uses INTEGER*4 and mixed type equivalence. For more information, see System Requirements in LIB. http://water.usgs.gov/software/DR3M/code/UNIX/dr3m2.1.source.tar.gz Fortran 77 II One-Dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage Robert Runkel 1998 OTIS is a mathematical simulation model used to characterize the fate and transport of water-borne solutes in streams and rivers. The governing equation underlying the model is the advection-dispersion equation with additional terms to account for transient storage, lateral inflow, first-order decay, and sorption. This equation and the associated equations describing transient storage and sorption are solved using a Crank-Nicolson finite-difference solution. OTIS may be used in conjunction with data from field-scale tracer experiments to quantify the hydrologic parameters affecting solute transport. This application typically involves a trial-and-error approach wherein parameter estimates are adjusted to obtain an acceptable match between simulated and observed tracer concentrations. Additional applications include analyses of nonconservative solutes that are subject to sorption processes or first-order decay. OTIS-P, a modified version of OTIS, couples the solution of the governing equation with a nonlinear regression package. OTIS-P determines an optimal set of parameter estimates that minimize the squared differences between the simulated and observed concentrations, thereby automating the parameter estimation process.

00076-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"2014-04-02"
00076-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This drying and warming experiment addresses the following questions: 1) Does ecosystem drying, warming and permafrost thaw cause a net release or uptake of C from the ecosystem to the atmosphere?, 2) Does the decomposition of old C that comprises the bulk of the soil C pool influence ecosystem C loss? 3) How do drying and warmign affect plant communities and ecosystem properties? We are answering these questions using a combined warming and drying experiment (DryPEHR), which is situated with the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project and located in an upland tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. Warming treatment here refers to growing season air temperature warming (~1C) using open top chambers (OTC) combined with soil 'warming' using snow fences during the snow covered months. Drying is achieve using an automated pumping system that lowers the water table in the dry plots. Soil warming began in 2008; OTCs and drying in 2011. This dataset contains static chamber measurements of CO2 flux at DryPEHR during the falls of 2011 and 2013."

Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope at this site in a 30-m-deep borehole that was installed in 1985. Warming treatment here refers to growing season air temperature warming using open top chambers (OTC) combined with soil insulation using snow fences during the snow covered months. Drying is achieved using an automated pumping system that lowers the water table in the dry plots. Soil warming began in 2008; OTCs and drying in 2011. Methods A clear chamber (~140 L, 0.36 m^2) was placed on the plot base and air was circulated between the chamber and an Li-820 infra-red gas analyzer at 1L/min. Air inside the chamber was also mixed with two small fans. The plot bases (12cm tall) are permanently installed ~7cm into the soil. During sampling, the CO2 concentration was recorded every 1 second for 2 minutes. Ecosystem respiration measurements were measured in the same way except during daytime hours a dark tarp was placed over the chamber. Each plot was sampled twice: once for ecosystem respiration and once for NEE. The soil temperature was measured with permanently installed thermo-couples. PAR inside the chamber was recorded with a Li-Cor quantum sensor and hand-held Li-1400.

Despite some temporal mismatch with the Sanborn Map coverage, this imagery helped identify block boundaries for early Phoenix neighborhoods. Sanborn Maps for 1900-1949 were available through the ProQuest Digital Sanborn Maps database; Sanborn Maps for 1963 were derived from original scans of a microfilm available through the Arizona State University Libraries Map Collection. For each year, clipped a 2002 Maricopa Assessor parcel feature class to the Sanborn Fire Insurance Map coverage for 1915 (roughly Phoenix’s 1915 incorporated boundary). Modified the feature class to include a historical land-use field. Using the ArcGIS Editor Toolbar, for each year (working backwards from 1949 and later adding 1963) merged and cut parcel boundaries as delimited by the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps. Assigned a land-use to each parcel based on classification scheme land-use types (see table). Recorded notes of nonconforming or atypical mixtures of features observed on parcels for future reclassification (as needed). For each year, created a secondary land-use field (“Compat_RC”) to generalize land-use into five categories for spatial analysis. Repaired parcel geometry and removed spurious “sliver” polygons; removed extraneous fields."

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

00080-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This generalized landcover classification of the Eastern Shore of Virginia focuses on major landforms and habitats of the Virginia Coast Reserve LTER.  The classification is based on a Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite image taken on July 25, 1989 at 15:14 GMT (11:14 EDT), which is roughly concurrent with mid-tide water levels as predicted for Wachapreague, VA (L=8:25, H=14:52 EDT).  The classification divides the landscape into three components: water (code 1); salt marsh (code 2); and upland/mainland areas (code 3).  The primary purpose of this dataset is to provide a background map layer over which VCRLTER researchers and students can plot individual research site locations for figures intended for publications and presentations."

A HOBO pressure transducer was used to measure stage height. HOBO was installed on 16 June 2011 and removed on 18 August 2011. Each instrument recorded stage height and temperature every 10 minutes. The observed stage height is used with the measured discharge to develop a rating curve. The rating curve is used to calculate discharge from the recorded stage height values. The equation for the HOBO rating curve is Q=1.8236x - 0.4266 where x is stage height in meters. The location of the instruments and discharge measurement was moved in 2009 to the current location due to potential road construction on the culvert at the Dalton Highway crossing.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00087-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design To assess the effects of increasing deciduous dominance on aboveground C pools, we surveyed road-accessible, mid-successional fire scars (20 to 59 years after fire) and nearby mature stands within interior Alaska during summers 2008 - 2011. Fire scars were mapped by the Alaska Fire Service and their locations acquired from the Alaska Geospatial Data Clearinghouse (U.S. Department of the Interior Bureau of Land Management 2012). Within each mid-successional fire scar, we located forest stands of varying deciduous dominance using a combination of satellite imagery depicting deciduous versus evergreen cover (Beck et al. 2011) and ground observations. Our goal was to find at least three stands per fire scar ranging from predominantly coniferous to predominantly deciduous canopy composition that could have originated following fire within a stand previously dominated by black spruce. However, this was not always possible, and some fire scars have only one stand or two or more stands with similar canopy composition. We also sampled mature black spruce (based on T. Hollingsworth sampling sites) and deciduous stands (often paired to a nearby mature black spruce stand). We assessed the possibility of black spruce origination by looking for fire-killed stems, stumps, and logs of black spruce, regenerating black spruce in the understory, and by avoiding southeast facing slopes, where black spruce typically does not grow. Fire-killed black spruce were differentiated from white spruce (P. glauca) based on size, location of cones, and twig morphology. We also avoided sampling poorly-drained black spruce stands, which have a longer burn return interval and rarely transition to other tree species. Methods FIELD: Within each stand, we established a 100-m long transect, subdivided into five 20-m long subsections. Along a 10 m portion of each 20-m subsection (note: a few stands in 2008 were measured along a 5-m long section), we measured the diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.4 m tall) or basal diameter (BD; for stems < 1.4 m tall) of all dead trees and large shrubs falling within 1 m to either side of the transect. This generated five replicate sub-plots within each stand. Snag inventories can be converted to dead biomass using allometric equations (Alexander et al. 2012) as the difference between total live biomass and live crown biomass. Standing dead biomass for alder can be estimated directly from allometric equations created from dead shrub raw harvest data.

00089-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In contribution to the Arctic Observing Network (AON), the researchers have established two observatories of landscape-level carbon, water and energy balances at Imnaviat Creek, Alaska and at Pleistocene Park near Cherskii, Russia. These will form part of a network of obervatories with Abisko (Sweden), Zackenburg (Greenland) and a location in the Canadian High Arctic which will provide further data points as part of the International Polar Year. This particular part of the project focuses on simultaneous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes of the terrestrial landscape at hourly, daily, seasonal and multi-year time scales. These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system. In support of these objectives, a 3m eddy covariance station was established on Imnaviat Creek, Alaska. This station has been continuoulsy monitoring carbon dioxide, water vapor, energy fluxes and various micrometeorological variables."

00089-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 datalogger and a loptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Mircrometeorlogical data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all datapoints are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the datalogger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis. The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data: 1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range. 2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceed a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered. 3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (ie. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.) 5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Dataloggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'. 6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers. 7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered. The following procedures are used to gap-till the data: 1) A P-th order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (ie. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

00089-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"There are two types of data that are collected from each flux station involved in the AON project: high frequency eddy covariance (EC) data and low frequency means of meteorological and subsurface data. On a daily basis, approximately 75Mb of high frequency binary data and 16Kb of low frequency ASCII data is collected. This station uses a CR3000 datalogger and a loptop to collect and store data. The CR3000 is used to measure the open-path EC equipment which is sampled at 10Hz. Mircrometeorlogical data is scanned at 0.33Hz and all datapoints are averaged every half hour. The CRBASIC program that controls the datalogger has been written in such a way that only the most basic corrections and filtering are applied to the raw data. These would include shifting the CSAT3 and LI7500 data arrays by 2 and 3 scans respectively to account for the inherent processing delays of these sensors. The high frequency data is processed to yield mass and energy fluxes using a Reynold's decomposition after which the following corrections are applied: the WPL correction, a coordinate rotation, a spectral correction and the 'Burba' correction. Further quality controls flags are generated such as a stationarity test and a foot print analysis. The high frequency processed tables are then combined with the low frequency micrometeorological data after which the data is both filtered and gap-filled. The following procedures are used to filter the data: 1) Parameters that are based on the engineering specifications of each instrument. This normally involves filtering data based on the operating temperature range. 2) Parameters that are based on the Automatic Gain Control of the LI7500 (AGC - lens transmissivity flag). If this value exceed a given threshold, the lens of the LI7500 is assumed to be obstructed by ice or snow. All measurements from this sensor and all radiation sensors are then assumed to be similarly obstructed and this data is filtered. 3) Any sources of air flow distortion are identified at each site and all EC measurements from those azimuth directions are filtered. Thus, if any wind that originates between these wind rejection angles, then this EC data is filtered out. 4) Parameters for impossible measurements (ie. negative values from a precipitation gauge or pyranometer.) 5) Parameters for previously flagged data including '-9999'. Dataloggers or other processed datasets for which raw data isn't available will sometimes have various flag strings in use. This will standardize everything to 'NaN'. 6) A three-standard deviation filter to get rid of extreme outliers. 7) A similarity/cluster filter - With certain instruments, the appearance of a string of identical values in a time series usually indicates measurement errors. Any time series with clusters of 5 identical values are filtered. The following procedures are used to gap-till the data: 1) A P-th order autoregressive model. Two values for each missing element in a time series are predicted with a forward-looking model and a back-looking model. This function is currently looking 168 elements in both directions in a time series and both predictions are averaged to produce a final estimate. This model is still capable of producing impossible values (ie. negative measurements from a pyranometer) which are filtered out - thus, there may still be gaps in the time series, but they will be minimized. 2) Filtered values from the beginning and end ranges of a time series are predicted using a variant of the MDV method wherein values are estimated using binned half-hourly averages from the following or the previous seven days.

These are the major regulatory drivers of the Arctic climate system and form key linkages and feedbacks between the land surface, the atmosphere and the oceans. We will provide a comprehensive description of the state of the regional Arctic system with respect to these variables, its overall regulation and controlling features and its interation with the global system.

00090-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Urban growth models have increasingly been used by planners and policy makers to visualize, organize, understand, and predict urban growth. However, these models reveal a wide disparity in their attention to policy factors. Some urban growth models capture few if any specific policy effects (e.g.,as model variables), while others integrate certain policies but not others. Since zoning policies are the most widely used form of land use control in the United States, their conspicuous absence from so many urban growth models is surprising. This research investigated the impacts of zoning on urban growth by calibrating and simulating a cellular automaton urban growth model, SLEUTH, under two conditions in a South Florida location. The first condition integrated restrictive agricultural zoning into SLEUTH, while the other ignored zoning data. Goodness of fit metrics indicate that including the agricultural zoning data improved model performance. The results further suggest that agricultural zoning has been somewhat successful in retarding urban growth in South Florida. Ignoring zoning information is detrimental to SLEUTH performance in particular, and urban growth modeling in general."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

00091-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"General Methodology Lake water samples are collected at specific depths with a five-liter Niskin bottle during normal LTER limnological sampling. In a darkened environment, water is decanted through tubing directly from the Niskin bottle into three-150 mL borosilicate glass bottles with Teflon screw cap liners (2-light, 1-dark). Each sample is inoculated with an appropriate volume. Material Sample Centrifuge bottles Labeling tape and Sharpie o 5mL volumetric pipet (glass) (Volumetric glass pipets are cleaned with water and then soaked in ready HCl over night after which they’re taken out to dry on the rack.) Ethanol 95% HCl “green” cleaning solution “Focusing solution” Shanking table Flowcell Sample preparation Invert sample bottle 3 times Fill 150mL of original sample into centrifuge bottles Label bottle with sample ID Shake bottle at 150rpm for 4min. on mixing table Note exact time after shaking on bottle Let sit/settle for 24hrs After exactly 24h aspirate the sample at the meniscus down to 30mL (careful to not stick the hose too deep into the settled sample to not loose particles) Centrifuge bottles are cleaned after every sample. Fill half way with clean water and shake then empty bottle. Clean with lab soap, water and scrubber/brush then rinse with clean water until no soap left. Air-dry bottles and caps until completely dry. Installing a flowcell Remove the Flow Cell Holder from the Flow Cell Holder Mount by loosening the thumb screw by turning counter-clockwise. Unscrew and remove the retaining cap from the base of the Flow Cell Holder. This is accomplished by turning the cap counter-clockwise. Place the appropriate flow cell into the slots of the Flow Cell Holder. Re-install the retaining cap onto the Flow Cell Holder by turning the cap clockwise. Gently hold the flow cell straight when tightening the cap. The cap is sufficiently tightened when the flow cell cannot be moved. Do not over- tighten the Flow Cell Holder cap. Excess pressure can break the glass flow cell. Re-install the Flow Cell Holder onto the FlowCell Holder Mount and tighten the thumb screw. Connect the flow cell tubing: Attach the inlet tube of the flow cell to the Sample Funnel or Pipette tip. Sample fluid should enter the top of the flow cell and flow down through and exit at the bottom. The shorter and straighter the tubing, the better. Starting and final cleanup Turn on FlowCAM Fill pipet tip with Ethanol/ Acetone and run on prime/forward until fluid has finished running through flowcell In the main window, select the setup >setup and focus. Watch for particles If starting up, begin sample run if focused, If shutting down; After Ethanol/Acetone has left tubing, set the speed to off and remove tubing from peristaltic pump Focusing After the starting cleanup the camera needs to be focused, either using the waste of old, already analyzed sample (similar to the one you’re about to run), or a concentrated solution Run Sample 3x5mL of each sample are run (3 replicates of each sample). Decontamination (BETWEEN SAMPLES). After sample leaves the flowcell , repeat the steps above. Only fill pipet tip half-way, making sure to rinse all sides of pipet tip. If highly concentrated sample, run on reverse first Shutting down and maintenance Data analysis Classification: To make a new classification a library has to be established first as well as filters within the library! Libraries are for grouping similar particles in order to create a filter. Typically a user will want to use between 6-60 particles in a Library to create a filter Library and Classification details in manual link below.

Material Sample Centrifuge bottles Labeling tape and Sharpie o 5mL volumetric pipet (glass) (Volumetric glass pipets are cleaned with water and then soaked in ready HCl over night after which they’re taken out to dry on the rack.) Ethanol 95% HCl “green” cleaning solution “Focusing solution” Shanking table Flowcell Sample preparation Invert sample bottle 3 times Fill 150mL of original sample into centrifuge bottles Label bottle with sample ID Shake bottle at 150rpm for 4min. on mixing table Note exact time after shaking on bottle Let sit/settle for 24hrs After exactly 24h aspirate the sample at the meniscus down to 30mL (careful to not stick the hose too deep into the settled sample to not loose particles) Centrifuge bottles are cleaned after every sample. Fill half way with clean water and shake then empty bottle. Clean with lab soap, water and scrubber/brush then rinse with clean water until no soap left. Air-dry bottles and caps until completely dry. Installing a flowcell Remove the Flow Cell Holder from the Flow Cell Holder Mount by loosening the thumb screw by turning counter-clockwise. Unscrew and remove the retaining cap from the base of the Flow Cell Holder. This is accomplished by turning the cap counter-clockwise. Place the appropriate flow cell into the slots of the Flow Cell Holder. Re-install the retaining cap onto the Flow Cell Holder by turning the cap clockwise. Gently hold the flow cell straight when tightening the cap. The cap is sufficiently tightened when the flow cell cannot be moved. Do not over- tighten the Flow Cell Holder cap. Excess pressure can break the glass flow cell. Re-install the Flow Cell Holder onto the FlowCell Holder Mount and tighten the thumb screw. Connect the flow cell tubing: Attach the inlet tube of the flow cell to the Sample Funnel or Pipette tip. Sample fluid should enter the top of the flow cell and flow down through and exit at the bottom. The shorter and straighter the tubing, the better. Starting and final cleanup Turn on FlowCAM Fill pipet tip with Ethanol/ Acetone and run on prime/forward until fluid has finished running through flowcell In the main window, select the setup >setup and focus. Watch for particles If starting up, begin sample run if focused, If shutting down; After Ethanol/Acetone has left tubing, set the speed to off and remove tubing from peristaltic pump Focusing After the starting cleanup the camera needs to be focused, either using the waste of old, already analyzed sample (similar to the one you’re about to run), or a concentrated solution Run Sample 3x5mL of each sample are run (3 replicates of each sample). Decontamination (BETWEEN SAMPLES). After sample leaves the flowcell , repeat the steps above. Only fill pipet tip half-way, making sure to rinse all sides of pipet tip. If highly concentrated sample, run on reverse first Shutting down and maintenance Data analysis Classification: To make a new classification a library has to be established first as well as filters within the library! Libraries are for grouping similar particles in order to create a filter. Typically a user will want to use between 6-60 particles in a Library to create a filter Library and Classification details in manual link below.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, and OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, and OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

GAFM transfer process will be finsihed off this year The GAFM station was moved ~5 m from its original site in 2013 (out of the stream bed). At this time, the three 107 temperature probes were placed in a vertical profile (10, 5, and 0 cm), similar to the other AWS (recording in Celsius) Air temp and RH are at 3 m, along with wind direction and speed. Incoming and outgoing SW and LW are also at 3 m, but were oriented parallel to the ground surface (rather than normal) in order to capture radiative flux into/out of the ice cliff. In 2013-2014, these sensors were replaced with a single NR-LITE2 net rad sensor which is oriented in a typical, ground-normal orientation (the original sensors did not survive contact with a katabatic wind storm some time over the winter). The SR is also at 3m and points towards the ice cliff. This instrument died in 2013 and failed in 2013-2014. I've got a replacement we can install this field season, since it is a useful measurement. The station was set up to sample sensors every 30 seconds and send summary statistics (for example, averages and maximums) to solid-state storage modules every 15 minutes. This has resulted in approximately 20 values being recorded for final storage in every output interval. The Garwood Ice Cliff meteorology station is located at latitude -78.025916 and longitude 164.1315333, its elevation is approximately 51 meters above sea level.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

00097-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In this larger study, we are asking the question: Is old carbon that comprises the bulk of the soil organic matter pool released in response to thawing of permafrost? We are answering this question by using a combination of field and laboratory experiments to measure net carbon exchange, radiocarbon isotope ratios in soil organic matter, soil respiration, and dissolved organic carbon, in tundra ecosystems. The objective of these proposed measurements is to develop a mechanistic understanding of the SOM sources contributing to C losses following permafrost thawing. We are making these measurements at an established tundra field site near Healy, Alaska in the foothills of the Alaska Range. Field measurements center on a natural experiment where permafrost has been observed to warm and thaw over the past several decades. This area represents a gradient of sites, each with a different degree of change due to permafrost thawing. In this area, we eatablished three sites with different degrees of disturbance from the permafrost thaw: 1) a relatively undisturbed tussock tundra (Minimal Thaw site), 2) a site adjacent to to the borehole which is monitoring permafrost thaw since 1985 with intermediate degree of disturbance (Moderate thaw site) and 3) a site where permafrost thaw apeared to have started more than three decades ago (Extensive thaw site) As such, this area is unique for addressing questions at the time and spatial scales relevant for change in arctic ecosystems. This data set includes the active layer depth (ALD), which is the maximum seasonal thaw depth from each of the three sites mentioned before."

00097-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design The study site at the Eight Mile Lake watershed is located in the northern foothills of the Alaska Range. Permafrost temperature has been monitored annually on a gentle north-facing slope at this site, in a 30 m deep borehole that was installed in 1985 before the permafrost started to thaw. While permafrost thaw can sometimes result in water ponding depending on local topography, this landscape consists largely of relatively well-drained uplands. In this watershed, we monitored three sites that represented differing amounts of change as a result of permafrost thaw based on observations of ground subsidence and depth of thaw. Our minimal thaw site had the shallowest summer thaw depth and the least ground surface subsidence, and the vegetation was typical moist acidic tundra, dominated by the tussock-forming sedge, Eriophorum vaginatum, with coexisting deciduous and evergreen shrubs, and an understory of mosses and lichens. A second site, located adjacent to the borehole, had moderate summer thaw depths and increased ground subsidence. Here the vegetation composition was similar to our minimal thaw site, but with increased biomass of all plant groups. Lastly, an extensive thaw site was located in an area where permafrost degradation had occurred at least several decades prior to the establishment of the borehole; thermokarst can already be observed in air photos of the area taken in 1954. This site had the deepest summer thaw depth and the most ground subsidence, and the plant biomass has shifted to dominance by shrubs, including blueberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) and cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), at the expense of sedges. This dataset includes measurements of carbon fluxes at each site for several years. Methods FIELD: Water table depth was measured through the growing season of each reported year as the distance from the ground to the water surface in 3 water wells located inside each gradient site (Ext = extensive thaw, Mod = moderate thaw and Min = Minimal thaw.

00098-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Urban growth models have increasingly been used by planners and policy makers to visualize, organize, understand, and predict urban growth. However, these models reveal a wide disparity in their attention to policy factors. Some urban growth models capture few if any specific policy effects (e.g.,as model variables), while others integrate certain policies but not others. Since zoning policies are the most widely used form of land use control in the United States, their conspicuous absence from so many urban growth models is surprising. This research investigated the impacts of zoning on urban growth by calibrating and simulating a cellular automaton urban growth model, SLEUTH, under two conditions in a South Florida location. The first condition integrated restrictive agricultural zoning into SLEUTH, while the other ignored zoning data. Goodness of fit metrics indicate that including the agricultural zoning data improved model performance. The results further suggest that agricultural zoning has been somewhat successful in retarding urban growth in South Florida. Ignoring zoning information is detrimental to SLEUTH performance in particular, and urban growth modeling in general."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"
