00000-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Metadata for BES site - Stream Temperature: Gwynns Falls at Carroll Park (GFCP): In the Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, BES) we use the watershed approach to evaluate integrated ecosystem function. The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Gwynns Falls at Route 1/Carroll Park. This sites samples drainage from approximately 16,000 ha of mixed suburban and urban watershed. The site has been monitored by USGS since 1994 and represents the boundary condition for entire Gwynns Falls above head of tidal influence. Additional site information can be found at: http://waterdata.usgs.gov/md/nwis/inventory/?site_no=01589352 Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in an urban catchment. Theme keywords: stream, watershed, temperature, urban, Baltimore Ecosystem Study Coordinates: Lat/Long 39.2711 (39 16 16) -76.6480 (-76 38 53)"

00001-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This study is a survey of the density of tall shrubs, saplings, and seedlings at Bonanza Creek LTER Control Plots. Densities have been measured at some sites since 1975 while others began in the mid 1980's. In 2006 methodology was changed in attempt to better capture the spatial variability of shrub and tree species within the research sites. The current method, presented here, uses a 2 meter wide transect along two site boundarys covering 220m2. All seedlings, saplings, and tall shrubs >1m (regardless of species) are counted by species and size class along the transect. The previous method used 4m2 circular plots at 20 points on a 10mx10m grid within the control plot for an area of 80m2. The circular method measured all seedlings, saplings, and a certain set of 'tall shrubs' (see metadata for <a href='http://www.lter.uaf.edu/data_detail.cfm?datafile_pkey=175'> Vegetation Plots of the Bonanza Creek LTER Control Plots: Species Count (1975 - 2004) </a> for a definition of 'tall shrubs'), regardless of height. The height requirement creates an issue when comparing the old and new methods for early successional stands. For Alnus and Salix this is likely only a problem in the FP0 sites as they are the only sites with a high density of shrubs shorter than 1m. Shrub community changes at these early successional sites should be analyzed using precent cover data. At the later successional sites most Alnus and Salix shrubs are greater than 1m so the transect method likely does not underrepresent density. The raw data from the circular method can be found in <a href='http://www.lter.uaf.edu/data_detail.cfm?datafile_pkey=175'> Vegetation Plots of the Bonanza Creek LTER Control Plots: Species Count (1975 - 2004) </a>."

These plots are used for experimental projects and the following of the natural changes occuring in ecosystem structure and function. More recently, three post-fire plots and upland black spruce sites were added. At each of these 35 sites (9x3), a 50x60 meter 'control plot' was established in order to monitor vegetation change. See BCEF Experimental Design for additional information. Methods FIELD: There are two measurement methods presented in this data file. The method code C refers to circular plots with a radius of 1.13m and and area of 4m2. The circular plots were centered on the vegetation plot stake. At each circular plot, all shrubs greater than 1 meter tall were counted and an average and maximium height were recorded. In 2006 shrub, sapling, and seedling data began being collected using transects rather than circular plots. The method code T refers to shrub data collected using transects. Two, 2-meter wide transects are run along the boundary of the research site with each starting from the prime corner (the corner closest to plot one). Transect 1 runs parallel to plots 1-5 and is 60m long, Transect 2 runs parallel to plots 1,10,11,20 and is 50m long. (NOTE: On several plots the river has washed away a large portion of the boundaries where the transect would be. At these sites, the transect is moved to the opposite boundary.)

The method code C refers to circular plots with a radius of 1.13m and and area of 4m2. The circular plots were centered on the vegetation plot stake. At each circular plot, all shrubs greater than 1 meter tall were counted and an average and maximium height were recorded. In 2006 shrub, sapling, and seedling data began being collected using transects rather than circular plots. The method code T refers to shrub data collected using transects. Two, 2-meter wide transects are run along the boundary of the research site with each starting from the prime corner (the corner closest to plot one). Transect 1 runs parallel to plots 1-5 and is 60m long, Transect 2 runs parallel to plots 1,10,11,20 and is 50m long. (NOTE: On several plots the river has washed away a large portion of the boundaries where the transect would be. At these sites, the transect is moved to the opposite boundary.)

00002-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Sawgrass biomass is measured for TS/Ph-1, 2, 3, & 6 since 1999; TS/Ph-4 & 5 since 1997 to 2006; SRS-1b, 2, & 3 since 2000; SRS1c for 2005 to 2006, and SRS1d since 2006. Three 1 m2 plots are placed on each site. The sites are measured every two months. The number of sawgrass plants is counted for each 1 m2 plot and one third or a minimum of fifteen plants is measured. For each measured plant, measurements of the total number of live leaves, length of the live leaves, and culm diameter at the base are taken. From these measurements we calculate the average leaf length, and the sum of the length of the leaves. We created a model for biomass using a stepwise regression to see which of the variables measured and calculated are more correlated to explain plant biomass. Obtaining the mean biomass for the plants within the plot and multiplying it by the number of plants counted in the plot calculates biomass for each plot. The total biomass for each plot is summed with the other two plots in the same site, and they are averaged to obtain one biomass number per site. To validate our model, plant clippings are obtained in which four plants are clipped (small, medium, large, inflorescence) from each site. The same measurements are applied to the clipped plants as those applied to the measured plants in the plots. The plant clippings are oven dried at 70 degrees C and weighed."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

Sampling began in 2005 for this time series. Data are interpolated onto a 20 minute grid. The two moored CTD packages are located approximately 5 and 14 meters above the bottom, and there are up to 5 additional temperature thermistors spaced vertically along the mooring line. This dataset is derived as a subset from three separate much larger more complex datasets: knb-lter-mcr.30, knb-lter-mcr.31, and knb-lter-mcr.32."

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00007-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design At each early, mid- and late-successional sites (n=3 stands/stage), the BNZ LTER maintains unmanipulated (control) plots (30 x 30 m), and plots (20 x 20 m) fertilized with N (100 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as NH4NO3) or P (80 kg P ha-1 yr-1 as P2O5). N and P fertilizer is applied in 3 monthly doses beginning just before leaf-out in late May each year. N and P fertilizer applications have continued since initiation in 1997 and 2004, respectively. Methods FIELD: In 2009, ten leaves were sampled from each of 5 randomly selected alders in each control, N-fertilized, and P-fertilized plot in replicated early, mid, and late successional stages during the peak growing season (first week of July) and just before leaf fall (third week of September). For each plant, the first fully-mature leaf from 10 branches was removed, these were stacked together and punched with a 3 cm diameter borer. LAB: Punches from each plant were dried, pooled, and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg to calculate specific leaf weight (SLW = mg cm-2). Total N was determined using a LECO TruSpec CN analyzer (St. Joseph, MI), and total P was determined colorometrically following perchloric acid digests using a modified Technicon autoanalyzer. N and P resorption were calculated as the difference in peak and senescent leaf nutrient contents expressed as a percentage of peak values. geoReference 2009-07-01 2009-10-01 Sampling Frequency As needed"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

In wet sedge tundra, three 1 m2-sized plots were positioned randomly in each of two treatments of block 2 of the LTER wet sedge scheme (outlet site), control and N+P-fertilized , respectively, in 2000. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N at one of three different dates of the summer season 2001. In moist acidic tussock tundra six 1 m2 sized plots were positioned in three of the 'X' (=extra') blocks of the LTER scheme, in 2001, inside an area extending 5 m from the boardwalks and, positioning plots so that similar area shares between tussocks and intertussock areas was achieved. In each of the three X blocks two 1m2-sized plots were established. The whole 5 m area of the X blocks extending from the board walks was divided into two halfs, each containing one of the 1m2 sized plots. One half was set aside as the control and the other half was designated to be fertilized. Fertilization with a Hoagland solution (see protocol) started in late summer 2001, and was repeated annually after that , early in the summer season. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N of the summer season 2002; all three pairs were labelled as closely together in time as logistically possible. For 14CO2 and 14CH4 determinations, dissolved gas (d-gas) and dissolved inorganic carbon (d-dic) samples were ran on Oxidation Line I, and bag samples were processed on Oxidation Line II. Both oxidation lines first trap CO2 in NaOH, oxidize residual CH4 to CO2 in an 800 ºC oven, then trap the CH4-derived CO2 in a 2nd NaOH solution (Whalen and Reebugh 1990). All scint vials from the oxidation lines were filled with 4mL of NaOH sample and 12mL of Scintiverse II cocktail. Solutions are then analyzed for 14C by a Beckman™ LS3801 Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC). 1. Dissolved Gas Sampling Description: Using soil sampling needles and a 60 mL syringe, we pulled 40 mL of bubble-free water out of the ground. We then pulled 20 mL of ambient air and vigorously shook the syringe for 2-3 minutes. After the shaking period, the gases in the headspace should be in equilibrium with the dissolved gas content. We transfered ~10-15 mL of the headspace air into a nylong, airtight syringe (Kling et al. 2000). The syringes were returned to the laboratory at the Toolik Field Station and were ran on the oxidation line. 2. Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) Sampling Description: After the gas samples were analyzed, we expelled all air and bubbles from the water syringe to a standard volume of 38mL. The remaining water was acidified with 0.5 mL of 0.2N HCl through the stopcock, which converts DIC to Carbon Dioxide. We then added nitrogen gas headspace to 60 ml, and shook vigorously to equilibrate the headspace and DIC content (Stainton 1973). We split the headspace gas – 8 ml to a syringe for the GC (CO2 only); and the remainder to the oxidation line. 3. Dissolve Organic Carbon Sampling Description: Using soil sampling needles and a 60 mL syringe, we pulled 40 mL of water out of the ground and filtered it through a Whatman GF/F filter (0.7µm pore size, nominal). At the laboratory, we pipetted 4 mL of the pore water and 12 mL of Scintiverse scint cocktail into a scint vial. We shook the solutions for 2 minutes on a shaker table, and then put the vial onto the LSC to determine the concentration of labeled DOC. 4. Bag Sampling Description: During the system flux measurements, a bag is attached to the flux chamber though a battery operated pump. 15 minutes after the methane flux sampling, the pump was activated and the chamber headspace was pumped into the sample bag. Upon returning to the lab, the carrier line was disconnected from the oxidation line and a bag sample was attached. The bag was allowed to empty for 2 hours. Bag volumes were measured by displacement of water. 4mL of NaOH from the second trap was mixed with scint cocktail and 14CO2 and 14CH4 were measured by LSC. 5. Soil Respiration Sampling Description: After a flux measurement, we allowed the CO2 concentrations to build-up in the head space of the soil collars for 40 minutes. We evacuated a butyl stopper sealed glass serum vial with a hand vaccuum pump. We then added 15 mL of Carbo-sorb through the septum. We took a 120 mL gas sample from the soil collar and injected/bubbled it into the Carbo-sorb. Upon returning to the TFS lab, we transfered 10mL by syringe of the Carbo-Sorb into 10mL of Permafluor scint cocktail in a scint vial. The 14CO2 was determined by LSC. Kling, G. W., G. W. Kipphut, M.

00011-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Adult Arctic Grayling were caught and tagged in the Kuparuk River. A second fishing campaign occurred later in the summer, and any fish that was recaptured was remeasured to determine growth. Phosphorus addition has occurred since 1983; station sites are relative distance from the original 1983 phosphorus dripper. Stations include sites in a reference, recovery, and fertilized reach. Reaches were defined based on the location of phosphorous addition (see methods). Arctic Grayling were caught early in the field season, tagged, and recaptured late in the field season. During each capture, the grayling were measured for length and weight. With fish that were recaptured, growth of each grayling during specific seasons was calculated. Data is for 1986 to 2003."

00011-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Arctic grayling were caught in the Kuparuk River using unbarbed hooks with hook and line gear. The fish were tagged with different types of tags, depending on the year of caputre. Originally, Floy tags were used, but recently, PIT tags have been used. If the fish were caught a second time during a single summer, the growth was determined based on the change in length and weight from the first capture to the second. The fish were kept in the same reach as original capture through the use of fish weirs blocking movement. When grayling were caught, the station was recorded. In 1983, phosphorus addition through dripping began at the site designated as 0.0k. Stations downstream of 0.0k have positive numbers and upstream have negative numbers. The reach upstream of the phosphorus addition has remained the reference reach for the duration of this dataset. Downstream of the original phosphorus addition was the fertilized reach. In 1985, the phosphorus dripper moved to 0.59k, creating a recovery reach from 0.0k to 0.59k. In 1996, the dripper was moved downstream to 1.4k, creating a recovery reach between 0.6k and 1.39k. The historic recovery reach from 0k to 0.59k had not been fertilzed for 11 years, so it was then considered part of the reference reach after 1996. Reach information can be found in data for specific time periods. Data is available for years 1896, and 1988 to 2003.

00011-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Arctic grayling were caught in the Kuparuk River using unbarbed hooks with hook and line gear. The fish were tagged with different types of tags, depending on the year of caputre. Originally, Floy tags were used, but recently, PIT tags have been used. If the fish were caught a second time during a single summer, the growth was determined based on the change in length and weight from the first capture to the second. The fish were kept in the same reach as original capture through the use of fish weirs blocking movement. When grayling were caught, the station was recorded. In 1983, phosphorus addition through dripping began at the site designated as 0.0k. Stations downstream of 0.0k have positive numbers and upstream have negative numbers. The reach upstream of the phosphorus addition has remained the reference reach for the duration of this dataset. Downstream of the original phosphorus addition was the fertilized reach. In 1985, the phosphorus dripper moved to 0.59k, creating a recovery reach from 0.0k to 0.59k. In 1996, the dripper was moved downstream to 1.4k, creating a recovery reach between 0.6k and 1.39k. The historic recovery reach from 0k to 0.59k had not been fertilzed for 11 years, so it was then considered part of the reference reach after 1996. Reach information can be found in data for specific time periods. Data is available for years 1896, and 1988 to 2003.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The sensors output a digital ASCII string at 1200 baud, containing four parameters for each time step: 1) Air temperature in degrees Kelvin*2, 2) Travel time in 10*microseconds, 3) Temperature compensated distance measured in mm, 4) the number of times the error checking algorithm was used after the first pass (retries). The ASCII string is input to a common Campbell Scientific Datalogger at each site. Dataloggers are programmed to store the travel time, and retries parameters as read, and to store temperature values converted to degrees Celsius and distance values converted to cm. At all three LTER sites, sensors are attached to pre-built structures developed by University of California, Merced. All structures are constructed with Â½â galvanized pipe. The heated sensor is located in the middle of a 3m boom, which crosses the center of Merced's plots (which are circles 3m in diameter). A 5-foot pipe extended from the boom is where the control sensor is located. Due to differences in structure and topography, sensors vary in their height from the ground. Data are retrieved from the datalogger during the snow season by field personnel managed by Dominik Schneider. The raw datalogger output is imported into an Excel spreadsheet, appending all previous data collected for the site. The data set is then analyzed for missing or grossly anomalous values, the findings of which are noted in the datalogger specific metadata file. Original data files can be requested from the Principal Investigator (PI), but to most users they will be useless. Snow depth data files were put into an Excel spreadsheet after minimal processing performed by the field technicians. Sensor offsets (distance from sensor to snow-free ground surface) were not measured until after melt at the USA site and were not measured at the Alpine and LSA sites. Distance to sensor was converted to snow depth by subtracting the maximum distance to sensor from all values. The Excel spreadsheet was then delivered to Leanne Lestak who performed initial processing on each file, checking for consecutive date/times, and changing missing data values to NaN. Initial processing is considered level 0 data, which was then input into a Matlab program written by Keith Musselman. An overall bias was applied to each sensor dataset (noted below under âBias Appliedâ), extraneous noisy values (either positive (noted in âMaximum Depth Applied During Matlab Post-Processingâ, i.e., data points greater than this number were deleted) or negative) were deleted, depths were interpolated across missing data âholesâ, and data was smoothed using a splining routine. This produced a preliminary level 1 dataset. Through consultations with data users, field technicians and Principal Investigators (PIs) a perfected level 1 product was produced. It is the responsibility of the PIs and applicable technicians to produce a viable level 2 product. This product will be delivered to Leanne Lestak for incorporation into the original dataset series. During production of the level 2 data set consultation with Leanne Lestak is highly advised. Data used for scientific purposes require level 2 processing. Contact Noah Molotch (contact information provided herein) for assistance with scientific data use. Each plot has a control and heated sensor and is labeled accordingly, e.g., plots 24c (control) and 24h (heated). Plots 21, 22, and 23 are adjacent to each other in the northwest part of the site. Plot 29 lies to the northeastern edge of the site. These plots were chosen because at the time of sensor installment in 2010, they were the only sites that did not have snow above the heaters, and thus the only sites where installment was possible. Data Processing Levels: Raw: Data as collected from the site-specific datalogger. Only grossly erroneous data removed (sensor malfunction, sensor absence). The raw datalogger output is imported into an Excel spreadsheet, appending all previous data collected for the site. For each timestamp there are four parameters per sensor in the raw data file: 1) air temperature in degrees C, 2) signal travel time in 10*microseconds, 3) snow depth in cm, 4) number of times the sensor had to retry in order to get a distance value Level 0: Initial processing check for consecutive date/times, missing values converted to NaN, distance converted to snow depth. Reformatted for input into Matlab post-processing code. Format required is tab-delimited text, rows are date/time stamp and columns are 1) Excel format date/time, 2) snow depth #1, 3) snow depth #2, etc. Level 1: An overall bias was applied to each sensor dataset (noted below under âBias Appliedâ), extraneous noisy values (either positive or negative) were deleted, depths were interpolated across missing data âholesâ, and data was smoothed using a splining routine. Through consultations with data users, field technicians and Principal Investigators (PIs) a perfected level 1 product was produced. Data is released as an Excel formatted file, which contains the following columns: 1) Date/time stamp, 2) Level 0 depth #1, 3) Level 1 depth #1, 4) Level 1 depth #2, 5) Level 1 depth #2, etc. Level 2: It is the responsibility of the PIs and applicable technicians to produce a viable level 2 product.

00013-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The Anaktuvuk River Fire occurred in 2007 on the North Slope of Alaska. In 2008, three eddy covariance towers were established at sites representing unburned tundra, moderately burned tundra, and severely burned tundra. The three sites (unburned, moderately burned and severely burned) were harvested for analysis of biomass, carbon concentration and nitrogen concentration during the summer of 2011. Units: Tissue mass data are expressed in g/m2.Sampling description: Two transects at each of three sites were harvested for aboveground biomass where transect 108 and 109 are from the unburned control site, 101 and 114 are from the severely burned site and 103 and 104 are from the moderately burned site . Quadrats measuring 10 x 40 cm were harvested every 5 meters over 50 meter transects for a total of 20 quadrats per site. Aboveground biomass is considered 'within' the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Briefly, harvest method were as follows: the rhizome-containing soil layer was harvested by cutting around each quadrat boundary with a serrated bread knife. All aboveground live vascular plant biomass, and all live rhizomes and belowground stems within the quadrat boundaries, were separated by species. Data and methods are further explained in 2011ARF_AbvgroundBiomassCN. For every second quadrat in a transect, two contiguous 10 x 20 cm soil monoliths were excised from the side of the pit, extending from the surface of the green moss to the surface of the mineral soil (roughly 5-30 cm depth depending on location). In addition, two cores (2.42 cm in diameter) were taken through the mineral soil from the bottom of these monoliths to the ice surface at the bottom of the thawed layer. Monoliths and cores were wrapped in tinfoil to preserve structure, returned to the field station, and refrigerated prior to analyses. Within 24 hours of collection, one monolith and one core from each location were processed for determination of microbial biomass, bulk density, moisture, and C and N concentrations in both soluble (NH4+, NO3-, DON, and DOC) pools and solid fractions. Soil data and further method description is available in file 2011ARF_SoilCN_byDepth and 2011ARF_SoilCN_byQuad. Coarse (> 2 mm) and fine roots (< 2 mm) were separated by hand from the other monolith and core. The core (mineral soil) and monolith (organic soil) were separated into 5 cm depth increments (incremental data by depth is shown in file 2011ARF_RootBiomassCN_byDepth). Fine roots were separated into Eriophorum vaginatum roots (which are readily distinguished due to their vertical growth pattern, consistent diameter, and lack of branching) and other roots. The samples were dried at 70°C in a drying oven and after several days weighed to the nearest milligram at Toolik Field Station. Root samples were analyzed for C and N content on a Costech Elemental Analyzer (Costech Analytical, Los Angeles, California, USA) calibrated with the NIST peach leaves standard (SRM 1547, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Incremental data by depth can be found in file 2011_ARF_RootBiomassCN_byDepth. For this file all data has been summed by quadrat for each variable.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

The tussock tundra plots are located near the Moist Acidic Tundra plots characterized by Shaver and Chapin (1991). The wet sedge plots are located near the outlet of Toolik Lake; all plots have been used by the Arctic LTER project at Toolik Lake. In wet sedge tundra, three 1 m2-sized plots were positioned randomly in each of two treatments of block 2 of the LTER wet sedge scheme (outlet site), control and N+P-fertilized , respectively, in 2000. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N at one of three different dates of the summer season 2001. In moist acidic tussock tundra six 1 m2 sized plots were positioned in three of the 'X' (=extra') blocks of the LTER scheme, in 2001, inside an area extending 5 m from the boardwalks and, positioning plots so that similar area shares between tussocks and intertussock areas was achieved. In each of the three X blocks two 1m2-sized plots were established. The whole 5 m area of the X blocks extending from the board walks was divided into two halfs, each containing one of the 1m2 sized plots. One half was set aside as the control and the other half was designated to be fertilized. Fertilization with a Hoagland solution (see protocol) started in late summer 2001, and was repeated annually after that , early in the summer season. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N of the summer season 2002; all three pairs were labelled as closely together in time as logistically possible. From these plots we collected soil cores, which we removed the root material. The a portion of the cores were placed in sealed mason jars. We fumigated the blank to remove the influce of microbial communities. At set intervals (1 day, 7 days, 3 weeks) we collected the air in the headspace of the mason jar and analyzed on a Shimadzu model 14A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO2 and CH4 content.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Wood will be used to attach the RLS. Wood attached with concrete adhesive and concrete screws. RLS attached to wood with screws and leveled with shingle shims. RLS cable attached to 2x4 wood which was secured along concrete. Cable attached to eye screws using cable ties. Measured distances Pier deck to sediment bottom, deck near logger down to bottom by floating dock directly downstream of logger/deck railing = 22.45 ft or 6.84 meters RLS height above pier deck = 33 inches or 0.838 meters IBYC NAVD88 benchmark/pier deck by datalogger = 2.78 meters, as determined by Trimble high precision GPS. 2010 2.773 2009 2.811 2008 2.779 2007 2.780 Calculated distances RLS to sediment bottom = 6.84 + .838 = 7.68 meters RLS relative to NAVD88 = 3.618 meters The OTT RLS sensor technology is based on impulse radar. Two antennas are enclosed in a compact housing and transmit pulses toward the water surface, through a Teflon face plate. The transmitting antenna transmits short radar pulses in the 24 GHz ISM band. The receiving antenna receives the pulses reflected from the water surface to determine the distance between the face plate of the radar sensor and the water surface. The time delay from transmission to receipt is proportional to the distance between sensor and water surface. Approximately 16 individual measurements are conducted per second and averaged after 20 seconds to minimize wave influences.

Two antennas are enclosed in a compact housing and transmit pulses toward the water surface, through a Teflon face plate. The transmitting antenna transmits short radar pulses in the 24 GHz ISM band. The receiving antenna receives the pulses reflected from the water surface to determine the distance between the face plate of the radar sensor and the water surface. The time delay from transmission to receipt is proportional to the distance between sensor and water surface. Approximately 16 individual measurements are conducted per second and averaged after 20 seconds to minimize wave influences. There are sporadic instances of no data (documented in Comments field of the data) due primarily to low battery voltage over several days causing the datalogger to malfunction."

The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Overlook Park, located off Queens Ferry Rd in Towson, Maryland near Overlook Park. The area draining the site is 217 ha and is 13% forested and 40% impervious. Watershed information was taken from delineations created with USGS StreamStats at http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/maryland.html Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a suburban watershed.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Bacterial production is determined by the incorporation of 13C labeled Leucine (Simon and Azam 1989). Water samples are vacuum filtered through 0.22 um Millapore GS cellulose nitrate filters. Samples are extracted with 5mL of 5% TCA for 5 minutes, rinsed with additional TCA, and air dried in mini-scintillation vials. Following the addition of 1 mL cellusolve, filters are left to dissolve overnight. Scinti-safe scintillation cocktail (4 mL) is then added to each vial and samples are counted at Toolik Field Station on a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Tri-Carb 2100TR) . Calculations of bacterial productivity assume that the Internal Dilution (ID) of leucine is 1, but studies show it may range from 1-2 (Kirchman 1993). Some published data from these LTER files have used an ID value different than 1; in those studies, the ID value used is stated in the article. 1. Simon, M., and F. Azam. 1989.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

00024-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Samples from designated stations from the Kuparuk River were collected during each summer from 1983 to current time. Total Dissolved Phosphorous (TDP) analysis began in 1994. Phosphorus addition has occurred since 1983; station sites are relative distance from the original 1983 phosphorus dripper. Stations include sites in a reference, recovery, and fertilized reach. Reaches were defined based on the location of phosphorous addition (see methods). Phosphoric acid is added to the stream to increase the soluble reactive phosphorus by 0.32 uM. Three sampling dates occurred each summer; once in June prior to the start of fertilization and once each in July and August. Note no data was collected in 2000."

00024-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Water samples were collected at designated stations along the Kuparuk RiverIn 1983, phosphorus addition through dripping began at the site designated as 0.0k. Stations downstream of 0.0k have positive numbers and upstream have negative numbers. The reach upstream of the phosphorus addition has remained the reference reach for the duration of this dataset. Downstream of the original phosphorus addition was the fertilized reach. In 1985, the phosphorus dripper moved to 0.59k, creating a recovery reach from 0.0k to 0.59k. In 1996, the dripper was moved downstream to 1.4k, creating a recovery reach between 0.6k and 1.39k. The historic recovery reach from 0k to 0.59k had not been fertilzed for 11 years, so it was then considered part of the reference reach after 1996. Reach information can be found in data for specific time periods. Water was filtered through a 25mm GF/F filter in the field and 60mL samples were then preserved with 100uL of 6N HCl for analysis during the following winter at the MBL (1994-2010) and at the Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Lab (2011-present). Samples were digested in an autoclave with potassium persulfate. Samples were then analyzed for phosphorus using the ascorbic acid molybdate method on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

Using YSI dissolved oxygen probes and meters, we measure dissolved oxygen change as the difference of initial and final oxygen concentrations over a two hour incubation. We calculate net primary productivity and respiration rates in units of oxygen and carbon, then normalize to the organic content (ash free dry weight) of the incubated periphyton."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

As the tide ebbs, fishes retreat into a subtidal refuge cleared when the tide has fallen. Three replicate nets have been sampled at 3 locations along a salinity gradient on Shark River for 4 years. Small resident forage fish and grass shrimp dominate the collections. Exotic species and estuarine transient species that use the estuary as a nursery are rare within the assemblage of fishes that routinely use the flooded forest."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes. National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514 The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park. There are a total of 21 sampling sites located in two major regions: 1) Shark River Slough and 2) Taylor Slough/Panhandle. -81.078 -80.490 25.761 24.913 2000-05-01 2006-04-30 FCE LTER II: Coastal Oligotrophic Ecosystems Research Evelyn Gaiser Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Program Florida International University University Park OE 148 Miami FL 33199 USA 305-348-6145 305-348-4096 gaisere@fiu.edu Lead Principal Investigator Mike Heithaus Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Program Department of Biological Sciences Marine Biology Program Florida International University Biscayne Bay Campus Miami FL 33181 USA (305) 919-5234 (305) 919-4030 heithaus@fiu.edu Principal Investigator Rudolf Jaffe Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Program Department of Chemistry Florida International University University Park CP 304 Miami FL 33199 USA 305-348-2456 305-348-4096 jaffer@fiu.edu Principal Investigator Rene Price Florida Coastal Everglades LTER Program Department of Earth Sciences Florida International University University Park PC 344 11200 SW 8th Street Miami FL 33199 USA 305-348-3119 305-348-3877 pricer@fiu.edu Principal Investigator Our FCE I research focused on understanding how dissolved organic matter from upstream oligotrophic marshes interacts with a marine source of phosphorus (P), the limiting nutrient, to control estuarine productivity where these two influences meet-in the oligohaline ecotone. This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00031-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This dataset contains pinon-juniper woodland biomass data and is part of a long-term study at the Sevilleta LTER measuring net primary production (NPP) across four distinct ecosystems: creosote-dominant shrubland (Site C, est. winter 1999), black grama-dominant grassland (Site G, est. winter 1999), blue grama-dominant grassland (Site B, est. winter 2002), and pinon-juniper woodland (Site P, est. winter 2003). Net primary production is a fundamental ecological variable that quantifies rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological processes.Above-ground net primary production is the change in plant biomass, represented by stems, flowers, fruit and and foliage, over time and incoporates growth as well as loss to death and decomposition. To measure this change the vegetation variables in this dataset, including species composition and the cover and height of individuals, are sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots within each site. A third sampling at Site C is performed in the winter. Volumetric measurements are made using vegetation data from permanent plots (SEV278, 'Pinon-Juniper (Core Site) Quadrat Data for the Net Primary Production Study') and regressions correlating species biomass and volume constructed using seasonal harvest weights from SEV157, 'Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data.'"

00031-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data Processing Techniques to Derive Biomass and NPP:Data from SEV278 and SEV157 are used used to calculate seasonal and annual production of each species in each quadrat for a given year. Allometric equations derived from harvested samples of each species for each season are applied to the measured cover, height, and count of each species in each quadrat. This provides seasonal biomass for winter, spring, and fall.Seasonal NPP is derived by subtracting the previous season's biomass from the biomass for the current season. For example, spring NPP is calculated by subtracting the winter weight from the spring weight for each species in a given quadrat. Negative differences are considered to be 0. Likewise, fall production is computed by subtracting spring biomass from fall biomass. Annual biomass is taken as the sum of spring and fall NPP."

00031-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"Location: The Cerro Montosa Pinyon-Juniper site has been the location of major Sevilleta LTER research since 1989. Meteorological trends, net primary productivity, rodent and ground-dwelling arthropod populations, mycorrhizal responses to fertilizer, pinyon-juniper fruit and nut production, and pinyon mortality are all being investigated at this site. Previous studies have included analyses of pinyon tree rings for regional climate reconstruction.Vegetation: The vegetation is New Mexico Pinyon-Juniper Woodland, dominated by Colorado pinyon (Pinus edulis) and one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma), and accompanied by gray oak (Quercus grisea). There is a diverse shrub component, including scrub live oak (Q. turbinella), mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus montanus), broom snakeweed (Gutierrezia sarothrae), sacahuista (Nolina microcarpa), red barberry (Mahonia haematocarpa), Apache plume (Fallugia paradoxa), tree cholla (Opuntia imbricata), skunkbush (Rhus trilobata), and banana yucca (Yucca baccata). Grass diversity is also high, and open spaces between trees are dominated by blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), with hairy and sideoats grama (B. hirsuta and B. curtipendula) and black grama (B. eriopoda) also being significant. Other common grasses include purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), wolftail (Lycurus phleoides), mountain and ring muhly (M. montanus and M. torreyi), and New Mexican porcupinegrass (Heterostipa neomexicana). Common forbs include small-flowered milkvetch (Astragalus nuttallianus), white sagebrush (Artemesia ludoviciana), Fendler’s arabis (Arabis fendleri), Fendler’s sandmat (Chamaesyce fendleri), New Mexico thistle (Cirsium neomexicanum), false pennyroyal (Hedeoma oblongifolia), bastard sage (Eriogonum wrightii), pingüe rubberweed (Hymenoxys richardsonii), large four o’clock (Mirabilis multiflora), Fendler's penstemon (Penstemon fendleri), and globemallows (Sphaeralcea hastulata and S. wrightii). , -106.535 -106.535 34.368 34.368 1976 1976 meter"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

00034-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The Anaktuvuk River Fire occurred in 2007 on the North Slope of Alaska. In 2008, three eddy covariance towers were established at sites representing unburned tundra, moderately burned tundra, and severely burned tundra. The three sites (unburned, moderately burned and severely burned) were harvested for analysis of biomass, carbon concentration and nitrogen concentration during the summer of 2011. Units: Tissue mass data are expressed in g/m2, carbon and nitrogen concentrations are expressed in percentages.Sampling description: Two transects at each of three sites were harvested for aboveground biomass, where transect 108 and 109 are from the unburned control site, 101 and 114 are from the severely burned site and 103 and 104 are from the moderately burned site. Quadrats measuring 10 x 40 cm were harvested every 5 meters over 50 meter transects for a total of 20 quadrats per site. Aboveground biomass is considered 'within' the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Briefly, harvest method were as follows: the rhizome-containing soil layer was harvested by cutting around each quadrat boundary with a serrated bread knife. All aboveground live vascular plant biomass, and all live rhizomes and belowground stems within the quadrat boundaries, were separated by species. Current-year’s growth from meristems located within the quadrat was included in the sample even if that growth extended outside the quadrat. New growth from meristems located outside, but that extended into the quadrat, was not included in the sample. For older stems that crossed the boundary, only the portion within the quadrat boundaries was included. Biomass produced in the current year by each vascular plant was separated into leaves, new aboveground stems, and inflorescences with their peduncles, except that new growth from rhizomes was included with previous years’ growth. Older biomass was separated into belowground stems and rhizomes, aboveground stems, and (for evergreens only) old leaves. All graminoid, forb, and deciduous shrub leaves were considered to be new biomass. Belowground stems were separated from aboveground old stems at the position of the first adventitious roots. Vascular plant litter and attached dead biomass were saved, but not separated by species. These biomass harvest methods are consistent with our previous and ongoing LTER studies and thus allow direct comparisons. Lichens, mosses (green portions only), and liverworts (Marchantia polymorpha from burned sites) were not separated into species or new and old growth. Green moss biomass has been estimated to consist of approximately 20% new growth in those species where old and new growth can be distinguished, but they are not the majority of moss species present in tussock tundra. All plant samples were dried at 60oC for 72 hours and weighed to the nearest milligram at Toolik Field Station. Samples lighter than 0.004 g were weighed on a five-place scale in Woods Hole, MA. Samples were weighed in their bags unless they were lighter than 10 standard deviations of the average weight of the bag. We pooled material of each plant tissue type (excluding roots) and species from all quadrats from a given transect into blocks where quadrats 1-5 and 6-10 for each transect were lumped, resulting in four blocks per sample site. Blocked samples were ground in a Wiley mill with a 40 mm sieve and analyzed for C and N content by a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 NC Soil Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cambridge, UK). C and N pools in biomass and NPP were calculated by multiplying the biomass of each plant species and tissue component by the appropriate concentration of C or N (from the pooled sample), and then summing over all species and tissues for each growth form in each quadrat.

00034-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The Anaktuvuk River Fire occurred in 2007 on the North Slope of Alaska. In 2008, three eddy covariance towers were established at sites representing unburned tundra, moderately burned tundra, and severely burned tundra. The three sites (unburned, moderately burned and severely burned) were harvested for analysis of biomass, carbon concentration and nitrogen concentration during the summer of 2011. Units: Tissue mass data are expressed in g/m2, carbon and nitrogen concentrations are expressed in percentages.Sampling description: Two transects at each of three sites were harvested for aboveground biomass, where transect 108 and 109 are from the unburned control site, 101 and 114 are from the severely burned site and 103 and 104 are from the moderately burned site. Quadrats measuring 10 x 40 cm were harvested every 5 meters over 50 meter transects for a total of 20 quadrats per site. Aboveground biomass is considered 'within' the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Briefly, harvest method were as follows: the rhizome-containing soil layer was harvested by cutting around each quadrat boundary with a serrated bread knife. All aboveground live vascular plant biomass, and all live rhizomes and belowground stems within the quadrat boundaries, were separated by species. Current-year’s growth from meristems located within the quadrat was included in the sample even if that growth extended outside the quadrat. New growth from meristems located outside, but that extended into the quadrat, was not included in the sample. For older stems that crossed the boundary, only the portion within the quadrat boundaries was included. Biomass produced in the current year by each vascular plant was separated into leaves, new aboveground stems, and inflorescences with their peduncles, except that new growth from rhizomes was included with previous years’ growth. Older biomass was separated into belowground stems and rhizomes, aboveground stems, and (for evergreens only) old leaves. All graminoid, forb, and deciduous shrub leaves were considered to be new biomass. Belowground stems were separated from aboveground old stems at the position of the first adventitious roots. Vascular plant litter and attached dead biomass were saved, but not separated by species. These biomass harvest methods are consistent with our previous and ongoing LTER studies and thus allow direct comparisons. Lichens, mosses (green portions only), and liverworts (Marchantia polymorpha from burned sites) were not separated into species or new and old growth. Green moss biomass has been estimated to consist of approximately 20% new growth in those species where old and new growth can be distinguished, but they are not the majority of moss species present in tussock tundra. All plant samples were dried at 60oC for 72 hours and weighed to the nearest milligram at Toolik Field Station. Samples lighter than 0.004 g were weighed on a five-place scale in Woods Hole, MA. Samples were weighed in their bags unless they were lighter than 10 standard deviations of the average weight of the bag. We pooled material of each plant tissue type (excluding roots) and species from all quadrats from a given transect into blocks where quadrats 1-5 and 6-10 for each transect were lumped, resulting in four blocks per sample site. Blocked samples were ground in a Wiley mill with a 40 mm sieve and analyzed for C and N content by a Thermo Scientific Flash 2000 NC Soil Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cambridge, UK). C and N pools in biomass and NPP were calculated by multiplying the biomass of each plant species and tissue component by the appropriate concentration of C or N (from the pooled sample), and then summing over all species and tissues for each growth form in each quadrat.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

00035-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Plot location was chosen based on dominate vegetation type (T or W). The tussock tundra plots are located near the Moist Acidic Tundra plots characterized by Shaver and Chapin (1991). The wet sedge plots are located near the outlet of Toolik Lake; all plots have been used by the Arctic LTER project at Toolik Lake. In wet sedge tundra, three 1 m2-sized plots were positioned randomly in each of two treatments of block 2 of the LTER wet sedge scheme (outlet site), control and N+P-fertilized , respectively, in 2000. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N at one of three different dates of the summer season 2001. In moist acidic tussock tundra six 1 m2 sized plots were positioned in three of the 'X' (=extra') blocks of the LTER scheme, in 2001, inside an area extending 5 m from the boardwalks and, positioning plots so that similar area shares between tussocks and intertussock areas was achieved. In each of the three X blocks two 1m2-sized plots were established. The whole 5 m area of the X blocks extending from the board walks was divided into two halfs, each containing one of the 1m2 sized plots. One half was set aside as the control and the other half was designated to be fertilized. Fertilization with a Hoagland solution (see protocol) started in late summer 2001, and was repeated annually after that , early in the summer season. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N of the summer season 2002; all three pairs were labelled as closely together in time as logistically possible. In each plot we installed two soil collars. On collection days we would place the collar cap on the collar, and wait 40 minutes to build up CO2 concentration in the headspace. We extracted 120 mL gas sample using a plastic 140 ml syringe with 6inch needle through collar septum. We transferred ~10 ml gas from original syringe into 20 ML nylon syringe to run on a Shimadzu Model 14A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO2 and CH4 content.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00036-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"We observed the methane flux of 12 experimental plots near Toolik Lake, Alaska. Plot location was chosen based on dominate vegetation type (T or W). The tussock tundra plots are located near the Moist Acidic Tundra plots characterized by Shaver ad Chapin (1991). The wet sedge plots are located near the outlet of Toolik Lake; all plots have been used by the Arctic LTER project at Toolik Lake. In wet sedge tundra, three 1 m2-sized plots were positioned randomly in each of two treatments of block 2 of the LTER wet sedge scheme (outlet site), control and N+P-fertilized , respectively, in 2000. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N at one of three different dates of the summer season 2001. In moist acidic tussock tundra six 1 m2 sized plots were positioned in three of the 'X' (=extra') blocks of the LTER scheme, in 2001, inside an area extending 5 m from the boardwalks and, positioning plots so that similar area shares between tussocks and intertussock areas was achieved. In each of the three X blocks two 1m2-sized plots were established. The whole 5 m area of the X blocks extending from the board walks was divided into two halfs, each containing one of the 1m2 sized plots. One half was set aside as the control and the other half was designated to be fertilized. Fertilization with a Hoagland solution (see protocol) started in late summer 2001, and was repeated annually after that , early in the summer season. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N of the summer season 2002; all three pairs were labelled as closely together in time as logistically possible. Sampling description: We used the static chamber method for each sampling event, covering the plot with a plexiglass fluxing chamber and a shade cloth to maintain a cool temperature. At twenty minute intervals for a total of 60 minutes, we obtained 10-20 mL of chamber air in nylong, airtight syringes. The syringes were returned to the laboratory at the Toolik Field Station and were ran on a Shimadzu model 14A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID). The chromatograph peak areas were converted to concentration based on a standard curve. Methane fluxes were calculated using a linear regression of the syringe concentrations that characterized the change in methane concentration in the flux chamber over time. Shaver, G.R., and F.S.

00037-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This archive features long-term measurements of the eddy and storage fluxes of 16O12C16O, 16O13C16O, and 18O12C16O at the Harvard Forest EMS flux tower. Provided are the individual isotopologue fluxes, the total CO2 flux, and the d13C and d18O isofluxes. The eddy (iso)fluxes were measured by eddy covariance (EC), with a 30-minute integration period on a 40-minute duty cycle. The storage fluxes were measured as the increase in storage below 29 m during the EC integration period, based on vertical integrations over 7 air sampling heights on the tower (0.2, 1.0, 7.5, 12.7, 18.1, 24.1, 29.0 m), once every 40 minutes. Corrected and uncorrected versions of the eddy (iso)fluxes are provided; the corrections account for high-frequency signal attenuation, and were made by comparing w-CO2 and w-T cospectra. The method is novel and complex and is described, along with all further details of the measurements, in an upcoming publication. The original, uncorrected cospectra are provided as well, for those wishing to employ an alternate correction method. These are not Fourier cospectra but rather multiresolution cospectra, as described in the following reference: Howell, J., Mahrt, L., 1997. Multiresolution flux decomposition. Boundary-Layer Meteorology 83, 117-137. The covariance is the simple sum (i.e. not the discretized integral) of all 15 points in the corresponding multiresolution cospectrum. Finally, this archive provides measurements of the total molar mixing ratio of CO2 to dry air and of the isotope ratios d13C and d18O in CO2, at each of the 7 heights. For the lower six heights, these measurements are provided only as 40-second averages of the original 4 Hz data (which are too copious to archive here), made once every 40 minutes. For the 29 m inlet (the main inlet, used for EC), these measurements are provided as 2-minute averages of the 4 Hz data, made continuously during the 30-minute EC integration periods. The last 40-seconds of each EC integration period is included also as the 7th height in the vertical profile record."

00037-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The molar mixing ratios of 16O12C16O, 16O13C16O, and 18O12C16O to dry air were measured by a quantum cascade laser spectrometer designed by Aerodyne Research Inc, which runs in a temperature-controlled enclosure in the EMS shack. Measurements were made near-continuously at 4 Hz, on a 40-minute duty cycle consisting of 30 min at 29 m (for EC), 1 min for each of the 'profile' heights, and 2 min for each of 2 calibration cylinders. The first 20 seconds of each 1-minute profile measurement, and of each 30-minute EC period, were disregarded to avoid transients while the system was flushed with the new sample gas. The first 30 seconds of each calibration cylinder measurement were similarly disregarded. The isotopologue molar mixing ratios were calibrated on a 40-minute interval by linear interpolation between the two aforementioned cylinders: a high span gas cylinder containing roughly 450 ppm CO2 in air, and a low span cylinder containing roughly 350 ppm CO2 in air. These 'working' tanks bracketed the sample gas total CO2 mixing ratio except when sampling from the subcanopy at night (when the total CO2 mixing ratio can reach 650 ppm). Systematic extrapolation errors in the 0.2 m and 1 m tower profile measurements are therefore a possibility; however, such errors are not likely to be larger than twice our usual systematic instrument errors (see below). The slopes and intercepts of the resulting calibration lines were interpolated onto the 4 Hz sample times and used to calibrate each sample measurement. Each pair of working tanks was calibrated in turn against three primary standard cylinders (at 315.48(6) ppm, 431.15(6) ppm, and 496.49(6) ppm CO2 in air) when the working tanks were full (~2000 psi) and when they had ~500 psi remaining, after which the working tanks were replaced to avoid the possibility of variations in total CO2, d13C, or d18O as the cylinders neared depletion. Before deployment, the primary standards were characterized by IRMS at the Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research at the University of Utah (for the isotope ratios) and by an IRGA (calibrated with a set of primary CO2 standards obtained from NOAA-GMD) in the Wofsy/Munger Laboratory at Harvard University (for the CO2 molar mixing ratio). Calibration of the working tanks against the primary standards was done using the spectrometer itself, in the field. The total CO2 molar mixing ratio (to dry air) and the isotope ratios d13C and d18O were calculated from the individual isotopologue molar mixing ratios measured by the spectrometer. This calculation required some assumptions about the molar mixing ratio of 12C17O16O and other unmeasured minor isotopologues, although the results are not significantly affected by the uncertainties associated with these assumptions. The short-term (3-hour) precision in the reported measurements for a 100-second integration time is 16 ppb in total CO2, 0.02 permil in d13C, and 0.03 permil in d18O (1 standard deviation). The long-term (6-month) accuracy is 69 ppb in total CO2, 0.05 permil in d13C, and 0.06 permil in d18O (1 standard deviation). Eddy and storage fluxes for each isotopologue and for total CO2, plus the eddy and storage isofluxes for 13C-CO2 and 18O-CO2, were calculated by eddy covariance using wind data from the sonic anemometer that is operated as part of the existing long-term eddy flux measurement system at the EMS.

00037-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The molar mixing ratios of 16O12C16O, 16O13C16O, and 18O12C16O to dry air were measured by a quantum cascade laser spectrometer designed by Aerodyne Research Inc, which runs in a temperature-controlled enclosure in the EMS shack. Measurements were made near-continuously at 4 Hz, on a 40-minute duty cycle consisting of 30 min at 29 m (for EC), 1 min for each of the 'profile' heights, and 2 min for each of 2 calibration cylinders. The first 20 seconds of each 1-minute profile measurement, and of each 30-minute EC period, were disregarded to avoid transients while the system was flushed with the new sample gas. The first 30 seconds of each calibration cylinder measurement were similarly disregarded. The isotopologue molar mixing ratios were calibrated on a 40-minute interval by linear interpolation between the two aforementioned cylinders: a high span gas cylinder containing roughly 450 ppm CO2 in air, and a low span cylinder containing roughly 350 ppm CO2 in air. These 'working' tanks bracketed the sample gas total CO2 mixing ratio except when sampling from the subcanopy at night (when the total CO2 mixing ratio can reach 650 ppm). Systematic extrapolation errors in the 0.2 m and 1 m tower profile measurements are therefore a possibility; however, such errors are not likely to be larger than twice our usual systematic instrument errors (see below). The slopes and intercepts of the resulting calibration lines were interpolated onto the 4 Hz sample times and used to calibrate each sample measurement. Each pair of working tanks was calibrated in turn against three primary standard cylinders (at 315.48(6) ppm, 431.15(6) ppm, and 496.49(6) ppm CO2 in air) when the working tanks were full (~2000 psi) and when they had ~500 psi remaining, after which the working tanks were replaced to avoid the possibility of variations in total CO2, d13C, or d18O as the cylinders neared depletion. Before deployment, the primary standards were characterized by IRMS at the Stable Isotope Ratio Facility for Environmental Research at the University of Utah (for the isotope ratios) and by an IRGA (calibrated with a set of primary CO2 standards obtained from NOAA-GMD) in the Wofsy/Munger Laboratory at Harvard University (for the CO2 molar mixing ratio). Calibration of the working tanks against the primary standards was done using the spectrometer itself, in the field. The total CO2 molar mixing ratio (to dry air) and the isotope ratios d13C and d18O were calculated from the individual isotopologue molar mixing ratios measured by the spectrometer. This calculation required some assumptions about the molar mixing ratio of 12C17O16O and other unmeasured minor isotopologues, although the results are not significantly affected by the uncertainties associated with these assumptions. The short-term (3-hour) precision in the reported measurements for a 100-second integration time is 16 ppb in total CO2, 0.02 permil in d13C, and 0.03 permil in d18O (1 standard deviation). The long-term (6-month) accuracy is 69 ppb in total CO2, 0.05 permil in d13C, and 0.06 permil in d18O (1 standard deviation). Eddy and storage fluxes for each isotopologue and for total CO2, plus the eddy and storage isofluxes for 13C-CO2 and 18O-CO2, were calculated by eddy covariance using wind data from the sonic anemometer that is operated as part of the existing long-term eddy flux measurement system at the EMS. Data from that system is listed in this archive under HF004: EMS - Canopy-Atmosphere Exchange of Carbon, Water and Energy. We have included some useful ancillary data from that dataset (PAR, water vapor flux) here when available."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Observations were logged at 15 minute intervals throughout the study period. The sensors were mounted on a 10m aluminum tower, with wind sensors mounted at the top, light sensors at approximately 5m, and other sensors at 2-3m to minimize interference from the surrounding landscape. This climate station was jointly operated by the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project, and University of Georgia Marine Institute."

Automatically-assigned qualifier flags are reviewed graphically and revised or augmented as deemed appropriate by GCE information management staff, based on metadata information from the contributor, values of other measured variables, or statistical tests. Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column."

Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER program, located on the central Georgia coast, was established in 2000. The study domain encompasses three adjacent sounds (Altamaha, Doboy, Sapelo) and includes upland (mainland, barrier islands, marsh hammocks), intertidal (fresh, brackish and salt marsh) and submerged (river, estuary, continental shelf) habitats. Patterns and processes in this complex landscape vary spatially within and between sites, and temporally on multiple scales (tidal, diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Overlain on this spatial and temporal variation are long-term trends caused by climate change, sea level rise, and human alterations of the landscape. These long-term trends are likely to manifest in many ways, including changes in water quality, river discharge, runoff and tidal inundation patterns throughout the estuarine landscape. The overarching goal of the GCE program is to understand the mechanisms by which variation in the quality, source and amount of both fresh and salt water create temporal and spatial variability in estuarine habitats and processes, in order to predict directional changes that will occur in response to long-term shifts in estuarine salinity patterns.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author\(s\) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades.

00046-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Climate models predict that water limited regions around the world will become drier and warmer in the near future, including southwestern North America. We developed a large-scale experimental system that allows testing of the ecosystem impacts of precipitation changes. Four treatments were applied to 1600 m2 plots (40 m × 40 m), each with three replicates in a piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniper monosperma) ecosystem. These species have extensive root systems, requiring large-scale manipulation to effectively alter soil water availability.  Treatments consisted of: 1) irrigation plots that receive supplemental water additions, 2) drought plots that receive 55% of ambient rainfall, 3) cover-control plots that receive ambient precipitation, but allow determination of treatment infrastructure artifacts, and 4) ambient control plots. Our drought structures effectively reduced soil water potential and volumetric water content compared to the ambient, cover-control, and water addition plots. Drought and cover control plots experienced an average increase in maximum soil and air temperature at ground level of 1-4° C during the growing season compared to ambient plots, and concurrent short-term diurnal increases in maximum air temperature were also observed directly above and below plastic structures. Our drought and irrigation treatments significantly influenced tree predawn water potential, sap-flow, and net photosynthesis, with drought treatment trees exhibiting significant decreases in physiological function compared to ambient and irrigated trees.  Supplemental irrigation resulted in a significant increase in both plant water potential and xylem sap-flow compared to trees in the other treatments. This experimental design effectively allows manipulation of plant water stress at the ecosystem scale, permits a wide range of drought conditions, and provides prolonged drought conditions comparable to historical droughts in the past – drought events for which wide-spread mortality in both these species was observed."

00046-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Site DescriptionIn total, our study site consisted of 12 experimental plots located in three replicate blocks that varied in slope % and aspect. The study utilized four different experimental treatments applied in three replicate blocks. The four experimental treatments included;1) un-manipulated, ambient control plots, 2) drought plots, 3) supplemental irrigation plots, and 4) cover-control plots that have a similar infrastructure to the drought plots, but remove no precipitation.  The three replicated blocks differed in their slope and aspect. One block of four plots was located on south facing slopes, one on north facing slopes, and one in a flat area of the landscape.  Experimental Treatment Design (see Pangle et al. 2012 for detailed methodology)To effectively reduce water availability to trees, we installed treatments of sufficient size to minimize tree water uptake from outside of the plot.  Thus, we constructed three replicated drought structures that were 40 m × 40 m (1600 m2). We targeted a 50% reduction in ambient precipitation through water removal troughs that covered ~50% of the land surface area. Drought plot infrastructure was positioned to insure that targeted Piñon pine and juniper were centrally located within each drought plot to provide the maximum distance between tree stems and the nearest plot boundary.  Each drought and cover-control plot consists of 27 parallel troughs running across the 40 m plot. Each trough was constructed with overlapping 3ft ×10 ft (0.91 m × 3.05 m) pieces of thermoplastic polymer sheets (Makloron SL Polycarbonate Sheet, Sheffield Plastics Inc, Sheffield, MA) fixed with self-tapping metal screws to horizontal rails that are approximately waist height and are supported by vertical posts every 2.5-3.5 m. The plastic sheets were bent into a concave shape to collect and divert the precipitation off of the plot. The bending and spacing of the plastic resulted in 0.81 m (32 in) troughs separated by 0.56 m (22 in) walkways.  Individual troughs often intersected the canopy of trees because of their height. The troughs were installed as close to the bole of the tree as possible without damaging branches in order to maximize the area covered by the plastic across the entire plot. An end-cap was attached to the downstream edge of the trough to prevent water from falling onto the base of the tree.  A piece of 3 in (7.62 cm) PVC pipe or suction hose (used when the bole of a tree was directly below trough) was then attached to the downstream side of the end-cap, enabling water to flow into the trough on the other side of a tree. End-caps were also placed at the downhill end of the troughs on the edge of the plot and fitted with 90 degree fittings to divert water down into a 30 cm2 gutter (open on top) that ran perpendicular to the plot. Collected water was then channeled from the gutter into adjacent arroyos for drainage away from the study area.We built cover-control infrastructures to investigate the impact of the plastic drought structures independent of changes in precipitation. This was necessary because of the high radiation environment in central New Mexico, in which the clear plastic troughs can effectively act as a greenhouse structure. The cover-control treatment had the same dimensions as the drought plots with one key difference. The plastic was attached to the rails in a convex orientation so precipitation would fall on top of the plastic and then drain directly down onto the plot. The cover-control plots were designed to receive the same amount of precipitation as un-manipulated ambient plots, with the precipitation falling and draining into the walkways between the rows of troughs. Cover-control plots were constructed between June-21-07 and July-24-07; drought plots were constructed between August-09-07 and August-27-07.  The total plastic coverage in each plot is 45% ± 1% of the 1600 m2 plot area due to the variable terrain and canopy cover. Our irrigation system consisted of above-canopy sprinkler nozzles configured to deliver supplemental rainstorm event(s) at a rate of 19 mm hr-1. Our irrigation system is a modified design of the above-canopy irrigation system outlined by Munster et al. (2006). Each of the three irrigation plots has three 2750 gal (10.41 m3) water storage tanks connected in parallel.  These tanks were filled with filtered reverse osmosis (RO) water brought to the site with multiple tractor-trailer trucks. During irrigation events, water is pumped from the tanks through a series of hoses attached to 16 equally-spaced sprinklers within the plot. Each sprinkler is 6.1 m (20 ft) tall (2-3 m higher than mean tree height), and fitted with a sprinkler nozzle that creates an even circular distribution of water with a radius of 5 m on the ground.  The irrigation systems were tested in October 2007 (2 mm supplemental), and full applications (19 mm) were applied in 2008 on 24-June, 15-July, and 26-August. During subsequent years (2009-2012), a total of four to six irrigation events (19mm each) were applied (please contact Will Pockman and/or Robert Pangle for specific application dates and rates).   Site Abiotic Monitoring (please see Pangle et al. 2012 for more detailed methodology)We used Campbell Scientific dataloggers to continuously monitor and record abiotic conditions and physiological measurements across the site.  All systems were connected to a solar-powered wireless network with NL100 relays (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT).  Plots were instrumented with CR-1000, CR-7, and CR-10X dataloggers (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT).  Each CR-1000 datalogger was accompanied by AM25T and AM 16/32 multiplexers to expand sensor measurement capacity (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT).  Abiotic conditions were measured under each cover type (n=3-5 locations per cover type): under piñon, juniper, and intercanopy areas between trees.  These measurements included; a) soil temperature (TS) at –5 cm depth and shielded air temperature (TA) at 10 cm (above soil surface), both measured with 24 gauge Type–T thermocouples (Omega, Stamford, CT), b) shallow soil volumetric water content (VWC) at –5 cm measured using EC-20 ECH2O probes (Decagon, Pullman, WA), and c) soil VWC at depth using EC-5 soil moisture probes (Decagon, Pullman, WA).  Soil VWC profiles had sensors installed at –15 cm, –20 cm, and as deep as possible (down to –100 cm, depending on soil conditions). Data processing and QA-QC were performed using either Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) or Microsoft Office 2010 Excel (Microsoft Corporation) software.  All raw and/or processed data traces were visually plotted and inspected for noisy, erroneous, or out of range data points or sensors traces.  All removed data points had a “NaN” value assigned.   Despite this QA-QC review and data cleaning, all data sets should still be evaluated for outliers, etc., as standard outlier statistical tests were not performed."

Landform: Located at the base of the eastern flank of the Los Pinos Mountains. Slope varies from 0-2% in experimental plots situated in level portions of the site, with steeper grades ranging from 6-18% for plots established on hill-slopes., Soils: Soil texture analysis across the site (both hill-slope and flat/level topography) revealed surface soils that are predominately silt loam with; (1) a transition to sandy loam texture at depth, and (2) a significant percentage of coarse fragments present both at the soil surface and throughout the profile. Soil depth across the site ranges from 20 to ≥ 100 cm, with shallower soil depths occurring on hill-slopes where depth to caliche and/or bed-rock is only 20-30 cm in some instances. , Hydrology: Well drained., Vegetation: The site is a piñon pine (Pinus edulis, Engelm.) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma (Engelm.) Sarg.) woodland, with several other commonly observed woody shrub species present, notably; Mahonia spp. (algerita), Falugia paradoxa (Apache plume), Quercus turbinella (shrub live oak), and Rhus spp. (sumac). Multiple species of cacti and agave (Cylindropuntia spp., Opuntia spp., and Yucca spp.) are present, along with numerous species of perennial grasses and forbs; including an extensive inter-canopy coverage by grasses of the genus Bouteloua. , Climate: Climate records (20-yr) from a nearby Sevilleta LTER meteorological station (Cerro Montoso #42; http://sev.lternet.edu/) indicate a mean annual precipitation total of 362.7 mm/yr. The region is strongly influenced by the North American Monsoon, with a large fraction of annual precipitation occurring in July, August, and September when monsoon circulation is active. Mean annual temperature (20-yr) at this nearby LTER site was 12.78 C, with a mean July maximum of 31.08 C and a mean December minimum of 3.38 C. , -106.5294 -106.5294 34.3864 34.3864 1911 1911 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

As the tide ebbs, fishes retreat into a subtidal refuge cleared when the tide has fallen. Three replicate nets have been sampled at 3 locations along a salinity gradient on Shark River for 4 years. Small resident forage fish and grass shrimp dominate the collections. Exotic species and estuarine transient species that use the estuary as a nursery are rare within the assemblage of fishes that routinely use the flooded forest."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

00050-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Samples from designated stations from the Kuparuk River were collected during each summer from 1983 to current time. Total Dissolved Phosphorous (TDP) analysis began in 1994. Phosphorus addition has occurred since 1983; station sites are relative distance from the original 1983 phosphorus dripper. Stations include sites in a reference, recovery, and fertilized reach. Reaches were defined based on the location of phosphorous addition (see methods). Phosphoric acid is added to the stream to increase the soluble reactive phosphorus by 0.32 uM. Three sampling dates occurred each summer; once in June prior to the start of fertilization and once each in July and August. Note no data was collected in 2000."

Stations downstream of 0.0k have positive numbers and upstream have negative numbers. The reach upstream of the phosphorus addition has remained the reference reach for the duration of this dataset. Downstream of the original phosphorus addition was the fertilized reach. In 1985, the phosphorus dripper moved to 0.59k, creating a recovery reach from 0.0k to 0.59k. In 1996, the dripper was moved downstream to 1.4k, creating a recovery reach between 0.6k and 1.39k. The historic recovery reach from 0k to 0.59k had not been fertilzed for 11 years, so it was then considered part of the reference reach after 1996. Reach information can be found in data for specific time periods. Water was filtered through a 25mm GF/F filter in the field and 60mL samples were then preserved with 100uL of 6N HCl for analysis during the following winter at the MBL (1994-2010) and at the Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Lab (2011-present). Samples were digested in an autoclave with potassium persulfate. Samples were then analyzed for phosphorus using the ascorbic acid molybdate method on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer. See current protocols at http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC Note No data was collected in 2000.

The historic recovery reach from 0k to 0.59k had not been fertilzed for 11 years, so it was then considered part of the reference reach after 1996. Reach information can be found in data for specific time periods. Water was filtered through a 25mm GF/F filter in the field and 60mL samples were then preserved with 100uL of 6N HCl for analysis during the following winter at the MBL (1994-2010) and at the Rubenstein Ecosystem Science Lab (2011-present). Samples were digested in an autoclave with potassium persulfate. Samples were then analyzed for phosphorus using the ascorbic acid molybdate method on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

00051-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"A better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients entering Florida Bay is a key issue regarding the restoration of the Everglades. In addition to precipitation, the other major source of freshwater to Florida Bay is from Taylor Slough and the C-111 Basin in the northeast section of the Bay. While it is known that these areas deliver significant amounts of N to the Bay, a significant portion of this is in the form of dissolved organic N (DON). The sources, environmental fate and bioavailability to microorganisms of this DON are however, not known. Should this DON be readily available, any increased load as a function of restoration changes might have an impact on internal phytoplankton bloom dynamics. No significant flocculation or precipitation of DOM occurred with increase in salinity, meaning that terrestrial DOM does not get trapped in the sediments but stays in the water column where it subjected to photolysis and advective transport. Sunlight has a significant effect on the chemical characteristics of DOM. While the DOC levels did not change significantly during photo-exposure, the optical characteristics of the DOM were modified. The environmental implications of this are conflicting: photo-induced polymerization may stabilize the DOM by reducing its bioavailability while photolysis may make the DOM more labile. Overall, DON bioavailability was relatively low in this region. Even though the amount of DON loaded to the bay may be significant, the fraction of DON available for microbial cycling is much smaller. The amount of N supplied by recycling may be a significant portion of the total DIN pool. All this must be considered in context with the proposed CERP modifications to flows. As of the latest initial Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP) update, the flows to Taylor Slough and C-111/Panhandle Basis are not predicted to change very much from base conditions. Therefore we do not expect any great increases in TN loading in this region. In contrast, the proposed flow increases to the Shark River Slough are large and may have significant effects on transport of DOM to the Southwest Florida Shelf. We believe that future efforts in DON characterization and bioavailability should be concentrated in this area."

00051-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N.

The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C.

Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted.

Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983).

The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C.

Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted.

Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983).

The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp. Two fluorescence indices were obtained by single emission scan measurements at excitation wavelengths of 313 nm and 370 nm. For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003).

For each scan, fluorescence intensity was measured at emission wavelengths ranging from 330 to 500 nm and from 385 to 550 nm, respectively, with a 5 nm bandpass for excitation and emission wavelengths. From the 313 nm scan, the maximum intensity (Fmax) and maximum wavelength (Fmax) were determined (De Souza Sierra et al. 1994, 1997). From the 370 nm scan, a fluorescence index (FI) was calculated (McKnight et al., 2001). These two indices have been used to distinguish the source of DOM (marine (microbial) vs. terrestrial (higher plant)). Furthermore, synchronous excitation-emission fluorescence scan was obtained at a constant offset value between excitation and emission wavelengths. All spectra were recorded at an offset value of 30 nm. From the synchronous scan, the fluorescence peak intensity at an excitation wavelength around 280 nm was measured as a proxy for proteinaceous materials concentration (Lu et al., 2003; Jaffe et al., 2004). The inner filter effect of measured fluorescence spectra were collected using UV-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of each sample (McKnight et al. 2001). The UV-Vis absorption spectra were collected using a Shimadzu UV-2102PC spectrophotometer. Absorption scans were collected between 250 and 800 nm in a 1cm quartz cuvette using Milli-Q water as the blank. Two optical parameters were determined: (1) the specific UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) and (2) the slope (S) parameter. The SUVA254 parameter is defined as the UV absorbance at 254 nm measured in inverse meters (m-1) divided by the DOC concentration measured in mg L-1 (Weishaar et al., 2003). The slope of the UV-Vis spectrum, the S parameter was obtained (Battin, 1998 and references therein). Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH;less than 2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples (Frankovich & Jones, 1998). TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOX-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). TON was determined by difference of TN and DIN. We used an alkaline phosphatase activity assay (APA) to determine the production of extracellular enzymes to mineralize phosphate from organic material (Hashimoto et al., 1985). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding o-methylfluorescein phosphate. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm). The increase in fluorescence over the incubation period determined APA (uM h-1). We used a similar method to determine the leucine aminopeptidase activity (LAP) to estimate production of extracelluar enzymes which mineralize nitrogen from organic material (Hoppe 1983). Duplicate unfiltered 3 ml samples were incubated for 2 hours after adding L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcourmarine. Initial and 2 hour readings were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrophotometer (excitation = 380 nm, emission = 440 nm) and used the change over the incubation period to determine LAP activity (uM h-1). Bacterial counts (BACT) were determined using epifluorescence microscopy with DAPI staining technique (Coleman, 1980; Porter & Feig, 1980). Samples were collected and Formalin buffered with phosphate solution to a final concentration of 2%. Aliquots were incubated at a final concentration of 25 ug ml-1 DAPI in a filtration tower for 20 minutes prior to filtration onto a 0.2 um black polycarbonate filter. The filter was then mounted onto a slide with low fluorescence immersion oil and examined under a 100W Hg bulb. Bacterial enumeration was performed by counting 10 sampling fields of a known size per slide, with a minimum of 300 cells per slide counted. Bacteria production (BP) was determined using 3H-thymidine incorporation incubations (Bell, 1993) using triplicates of each sample and a 4% final concentration formalin blank for each. With each 3H-thymidine incubation experiment we ran a blank sample for specific activity of the 3H-thymidine. Filters were placed in scintillation vials to which 10 ml of Ultima Gold fluor was added and counted in a Beckman liquid scintillation counter using external channels ratio correction. Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX- - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX- + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in uM, except where noted. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis. The total dissolved nitrogen pool (TDN) in a sample is made up of DIN and DON. At 0, 4, and 16 days, bacteria were classified as either spheres or rods and their diameters and lengths measured using a Whippled grid with smaller division of 2 nm. We assumed that half the bacteria were spheres, the other half rods. Bacterial cell volume (BV, um3) was calculated using standard equations. The C:V used was for bacteria grown under N limitation and should therefore be applicable to this experiment.

The freshwater marsh site (TS/PH2) and mangrove site (TS/PH6) are sampled semi-continuously for TN and TP as part of the FCE LTER Program (see http://fcelter.fiu.edu). The Florida Bay site (TS/PH9) was sampled monthly as part of the SERC Water Quality Monitoring Network (http://serc.fiu.edu/wqmnetwork/). Water samples were collected on August 4, 2003 from three sites in the Everglades hydroscape. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The three sampling sites selected for this study were distributed along a transect extending from the freshwater marsh of Taylor Slough through the mangrove fringe and into Florida Bay. Water quality parameters such as total nitrogen (TN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and other basic water quality parameters were determined in monthly grab samples taken from all sites. Four experiments were initiated to examine the physical, chemical, biological, and combined physical/biological effects on DOM and DON from the Everglades. Water samples were collected at 10 cm depth using acid washed, autoclaved distilled water (ADW) rinsed 8 l brown Nalgene bottles. Sample bottles were rinsed three times with sample water prior to collection. A 1 l brown Nalgene bottle was collected from the TS/PH9 site for a bacteria inoculum. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of salinity on the flocculation of DOM. The idea was to quantify the amount of DOM from the Everglades that flocculates and/or precipitates out of solution upon transport to the higher salinity waters of Florida Bay. Low salinity water samples (200 ml) from TS/PH 2 and TS/PH 6 were placed in individual 250 ml Nalgene brown bottles to which varying amounts of artificial sea salt crystals were added to produce salinity levels of 0, 5, 15, 25, and 35 ppm. The bottles were placed on a shaker table at 200 rpm for 1 h and then stood for 24 h at 22 degrees C. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was measured after filtration through 0.2.um Durapore membrane filters to estimate flocculation. Filtered samples were also analyzed for fluorescence properties. The experiments were conducted in duplicate.Subsamples (150 ml) of filtered (less than 0.2 um) water (TS/PH 2, 6a, and 9) were irradiated using a solar simulator at 765 W m2 (corresponding to solar noon at mid-latitude). After irradiation of designed period (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of continuous irradiation; 24 hour day periods of simulated sunlight), samples were filtered (less than 0.2um) and analyzed for DOC concentration and UV absorption and fluorescence emission properties. The experiment was conducted in duplicate. Upon return to the laboratory, water samples were immediately passed through a GF/F filter, then through a sterile 0.2 um cartridge filter, and stored in brown Nalgene sample bottles. The 1 l water sample collected from TS/PH9 was filtered through a sterile 0.8 um filter and stored at 4 degrees C to use as inoculum. 2 l of the 0.2 um filtered water were placed into each of the twelve, 2.5 l polycarbonate bottles that had been acid washed and ADW rinsed. The salinity of each of the bottles was adjusted to that of TS/PH9 (34.5) with NaCl. Nutrient additions were made to effect final concentrations of 5 uM P as H3PO4 and 100 uM C as glucose. The P and C additions assured that N limiting conditions were maintained in the bottles (Stephanauskas et al., 1999). A 10 ml bacterial inoculum of GF/F filtered water from TS/PH9 was added at the initiation of the experiment. Duplicate bottles were covered with aluminum tape and incubated in the dark at 30 degrees C. DON bioavailability was quantified using 16 day incubations (Servais et al., 1989; Boyer & Groffman, 1996) during which we measured loss of the DON fraction and any change in nutrients and bacterial N. Bottles were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 days by collecting a 250 ml volume of water from each of the bottles. Unfiltered samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), leucine aminopepdidase (LAP), bacterial numbers (BACT), and bacterial production (BP). Subsamples were filtered through Whatman GF/F filters prior to analysis for nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), maximum fluorescence intensity (Fmax), wavelength of maximum fluorescence intensity (fmax), fluorescence index (FI), and synchronous fluorescence (Peak I).Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Jobin-Yvon-Horiba Spex Fluoromax-3 fluorometer equipped with a 150W continuous output Xenon arc lamp.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

00052-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"On 7 January 2010, a SonTek Argonaut-XR 1.5 MHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was fixed at the bottom of the lake ice in the Lake Hoare Limno Hole inside the Polar Haven, looking downward through the water column. Every 10 seconds, the ADCP measured horizontal and vertical current velocities in ten, 30-cm-thick cells between 0.5 and 3.5 m below the lake ice. Over 32.5 hours, horizontal currents in the shallowest cell (0.5 to 0.8 m below lake ice) had a mean speed of 23.8 cm/sec. This speed was independently validated by lowering a SonTek handheld Acoustic Doppler Velocity (ADV) meter into the ice hole. Horizontal speeds oscillated between 10.1 and 37.5 cm/sec over the course of the ADCP dataset. Fast Fourier Transforms of x-direction velocity data from the shallowest cell identified oscillation periods of 11, 3.7, and 2.5 minutes consistent with the theoretical first-mode longitudinal surface seiche in Lake Hoare. Current direction oscillated between N 78 degrees E and N 289 degrees E along the east-west longitudinal axis of the lake, consistent with the behavior of a seiche."

00053-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Metadata for BES site - Stream Temperature: Jennifer Branch at Northwind (JBNW): In the Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, BES) we use the watershed approach to evaluate integrated ecosystem function. The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Jennifer Branch off Northwind Rd in Carney, MD. It is located close to the 'Cub Hill' flux tower. The area draining this site is about 448 ha and is 19% forested and 20.5% impervious of both high and low density development. This site includes drainage from the other Jennifer Branch sites that are monitored. Watershed information was taken from delineations created with USGS StreamStats at http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/maryland.html Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a suburban watershed. Theme keywords: stream, watershed, temperature, suburban, Baltimore Ecosystem Study Coordinates: Lat/Long 39.4075 (39 24 27) -76.5037 (-76 30 13)"

00054-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Metadata for BES site - Stream Temperature: Reservoir Hill (RRHL): In the Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, BES) we use the watershed approach to evaluate integrated ecosystem function. The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Reservoir Hill, a stream located in Carney, Maryland. It was delineated using USGS StreamStats, and was intermittently dry throughout the monitoring record. Data for this site should be carefully examined before use. Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a suburban watershed. Theme keywords: stream, watershed, temperature, suburban, Baltimore Ecosystem Study"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Observations were logged at 15 minute intervals throughout the study period. The sensors were mounted on a 10m aluminum tower, with wind sensors mounted at the top, light sensors at approximately 5m, and other sensors at 2-3m to minimize interference from the surrounding landscape. This climate station was jointly operated by the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project, and University of Georgia Marine Institute."

Summary statistics were also tabulated by the CR10X program and logged at 60 minute and 24 hour intervals. Sets of measurements and calculations were stored as distinct numbered arrays in the data logger storage module, and then parsed and analyzed separately when the data was periodically downloaded from the station. Data from all sensors were collected and logged at 15 minute intervals by an automated Campbell Scientific Instruments data logger (model CR10X). Values and times of minimum and maximum air temperature and maximum wind speed were calculated by the CR10X program, as well as Standard Error of Wind Direction.

Summary statistics were also tabulated by the CR10X program and logged at 60 minute and 24 hour intervals. Sets of measurements and calculations were stored as distinct numbered arrays in the data logger storage module, and then parsed and analyzed separately when the data was periodically downloaded from the station. Data from all sensors were collected and logged at 15 minute intervals by an automated Campbell Scientific Instruments data logger (model CR10X). Values and times of minimum and maximum air temperature and maximum wind speed were calculated by the CR10X program, as well as Standard Error of Wind Direction.

Automatically-assigned qualifier flags are reviewed graphically and revised or augmented as deemed appropriate by GCE information management staff, based on metadata information from the contributor, values of other measured variables, or statistical tests. Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column."

00057-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Water quality samples are being collected using ISCO autosamplers at all wetland sites (that is, all sites except TS/Ph-9, 10, and 11). The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). The samples are collected every 3-4 weeks and analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filter immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with a YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached. Rain event samples are collected, treated, and analyzed as all other water quality samples."

The autosamplers contain 24 1L bottles. Water is sampled by programming the autosamplers to take composite samples once every 3 days. These samples are a composite of four 250mL subsamples drawn every 18 hours (a sampling scheme that captures a dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight sample in every three day composite). Collection of composite samples may result in a composite sample which is less than three days; samples are collected every 3-4 weeks. The recorded date for each composite sample indicates the end date of the sample interval. Samples are analyzed for total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), and salinity. When sites are visited to collect these samples, we also collect a grab sample that is immediately put on ice. A portion of these grab samples is filtered through a Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 um) immediately upon return to the lab, and the filtered samples are analyzed for inorganic nutrients such as NO2-, NO3-, NH4+, SRP, and DOC. The unfiltered fraction of these grab samples is analyzed for TP, TN, and TOC. We use these montly grab samples to generate relationships between TP and SRP, and between TN and NO2- + NO3- + NH4+. Dissolved nutrients are measured using standard rapid flow analyzer (RFA) techniques. TP is analyzed with a modified Solorzano and Sharp (1980) technique. TN is measured with an Antec TN analyzer, TOC and DOC are quantified on a Shimadzu TOC Analyzer, and salinity is measured with a YSI conductivity meter. In addition to the regular water quality monitoring, we use the rain level actuators at all freshwater sites to trigger water sampling after rain events exceed a given threshold of duration and/or intensity. As currently programmed, when the threshold of = 2.5 cm of rain per hour is passed, the autosampler at that site collects a 500mL sample 30 minutes after the threshold has been reached.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict.

The reach upstream of the phosphorus addition has remained the reference reach for the duration of this dataset. Downstream of the original phosphorus addition was the fertilized reach. In 1985, the phosphorus dripper moved to 0.59k, creating a recovery reach from 0.0k to 0.59k. In 1996, the dripper was moved downstream to 1.4k, creating a recovery reach between 0.6k and 1.39k. The historic recovery reach from 0k to 0.59k had not been fertilzed for 11 years, so it was then considered part of the reference reach after 1996. Reach information can be found in data for specific time periods. Water was filtered through a 25mm GF/F filter in the field; samples were acidified and refrigerated at 4C until analysis at the MBL until 1994.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

00060-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"In June and August 2010, soil samples were collected from control, and N+P plots from within a set of treatments in Moist Acidic Tundra plots established in 1989. We also sampled set of N+P plots within the same block array established in 1996 as part of a fertilization and herbivore exclusion factorial experiment. A set of of Control and N+P plots established on an adjacent hillslope in 2006 with both equivalent (high) and half (low) the fertilization rate of the 89/96 plots were also sampled. At the time of sample collection we separated the soil into organic horizon, organic/mineral interface, and the upper 5cm of the mineral soil. We determined percent moisture for all soils and quantified the biomass of members of the belowground community. Direct count slides for microbial biomass estimation were made using the methods of Bloem (1995) as adapted by Frey et al. (1999). 10ml of a soil solution diluted 1:100 (5g initial soil mass) was added to each of 5 6mm diameter wells on a slide. Bacteria slides were stained with DTAF (5-(4, 6 dichlorotriazin-2-yl) aminofluorescein) and Fungi slides were stained with calcifluor M2R fluorescence brightener. Direct counts were made using epifluoresence microscopy. Bacteria were counted, 10 images per well, 2 wells per sample. Fungal hyphal length (Lodge and Ingham 1991) was estimated using the formula of Newman (1966): R=pNA/2H where N=number of hyphae crossing transect line, A=area of well, H=total length of transects. 2 wells, each with 10 images, 3 transects per image were used. Protozoa densities were estimated from 10 g soil samples using Most Probable Number MPN (Darbyshire et al. 1974; Ingham 1994). 10 g soil was serially diluted 10-1-10-6. Using a 24-well tissue culture plate, four replicate wells of each of the six dilutions were created by adding 0.5 ml soil solution to the wells (Rusterholz and Mallory 1994). E. coli, a bacterium food source for protozoa was added to each of the wells. Protozoa were separated into the broad categories of Amoebae, Flagellates and Ciliates. Nematodes were isolated from 20 g of soil samples using Baermann Funnels (Hall 1996). Nematodes were preserved in formalin, counted and identified to functional group based on the morphology of the stoma and stylet (Niles 1994). Rotifers, Tardigrades, and Enchytraeids were isolated from 5 g of soil using the methods of Peters et al. (1993). Microarthropods were heat-extracted into 70% ethanol from soils using Tullgren funnels (Moore et al. 2000). The intact sample pairs from each plot were wrapped together in cotton cheesecloth, weighed, placed over a funnel, and heated with a 9-W incandescent lightbulb for 5 days until dry.

Fungal hyphal length (Lodge and Ingham 1991) was estimated using the formula of Newman (1966): R=pNA/2H where N=number of hyphae crossing transect line, A=area of well, H=total length of transects. 2 wells, each with 10 images, 3 transects per image were used. Protozoa densities were estimated from 10 g soil samples using Most Probable Number MPN (Darbyshire et al. 1974; Ingham 1994). 10 g soil was serially diluted 10-1-10-6. Using a 24-well tissue culture plate, four replicate wells of each of the six dilutions were created by adding 0.5 ml soil solution to the wells (Rusterholz and Mallory 1994). E. coli, a bacterium food source for protozoa was added to each of the wells. Protozoa were separated into the broad categories of Amoebae, Flagellates and Ciliates. Nematodes were isolated from 20 g of soil samples using Baermann Funnels (Hall 1996). Nematodes were preserved in formalin, counted and identified to functional group based on the morphology of the stoma and stylet (Niles 1994). Rotifers, Tardigrades, and Enchytraeids were isolated from 5 g of soil using the methods of Peters et al. (1993). Microarthropods were heat-extracted into 70% ethanol from soils using Tullgren funnels (Moore et al. 2000). The intact sample pairs from each plot were wrapped together in cotton cheesecloth, weighed, placed over a funnel, and heated with a 9-W incandescent lightbulb for 5 days until dry.

Observations were logged at 15 minute intervals throughout the study period. The sensors were mounted on a 10m aluminum tower, with wind sensors mounted at the top, light sensors at approximately 5m, and other sensors at 2-3m to minimize interference from the surrounding landscape. This climate station was jointly operated by the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve, the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project, and University of Georgia Marine Institute."

Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Automatically-assigned qualifier flags are reviewed graphically and revised or augmented as deemed appropriate by GCE information management staff, based on metadata information from the contributor, values of other measured variables, or statistical tests. Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column."

Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER program, located on the central Georgia coast, was established in 2000. The study domain encompasses three adjacent sounds (Altamaha, Doboy, Sapelo) and includes upland (mainland, barrier islands, marsh hammocks), intertidal (fresh, brackish and salt marsh) and submerged (river, estuary, continental shelf) habitats. Patterns and processes in this complex landscape vary spatially within and between sites, and temporally on multiple scales (tidal, diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Overlain on this spatial and temporal variation are long-term trends caused by climate change, sea level rise, and human alterations of the landscape. These long-term trends are likely to manifest in many ways, including changes in water quality, river discharge, runoff and tidal inundation patterns throughout the estuarine landscape. The overarching goal of the GCE program is to understand the mechanisms by which variation in the quality, source and amount of both fresh and salt water create temporal and spatial variability in estuarine habitats and processes, in order to predict directional changes that will occur in response to long-term shifts in estuarine salinity patterns.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

00064-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Metadata for BES site - Stream Temperature: Hickory Lot (HYLT): In the Baltimore urban long-term ecological research (LTER) project, (Baltimore Ecosystem Study, BES) we use the watershed approach to evaluate integrated ecosystem function. The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Hickory Lot. This site is located in Hampton, Maryland and drains approximately 122 ha of 40% forested and 6% impervious residential neighborhoods. Watershed information was taken from delineations created with USGS StreamStats at http://water.usgs.gov/osw/streamstats/maryland.html Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a suburban watershed.

00065-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Seawater intrusion into a coastal aquifer mixes with the discharging fresh water to form a zone of mixed composition. This mixing zone is considered to be geochemical important in a carbonate aquifer as an area of enhanced carbonate mineral dissolution and,or precipitation. Ion exchange reactions are also common within the mixing zone as the dominant cation in seawater, sodium, replaces other ions adsorbed to the aquifer matrix. Phosphorus has a strong affinity for adsorption to calcium carbonate minerals. Both the dissolution of calcium carbonate minerals as well as ion exchange reactions have the potential to release phosphorus from the aquifer matrix to the groundwater. Discharge of this phosphorus-laden groundwater, as induced by the fresh/saline water interface, may then be an additional source of phosphorus to the overlying coastal environments. Both surface water and groundwater were collected across the seawater intrusion zone of the coastal Everglades in south Florida during the summer of 2003. Hydrogen sulfide was released from the groundwater wells during sampling, indicating the groundwater was most likely anoxic. In order to reduce the potential exposure of the groundwater to oxygen during sampling, groundwater samples were collected in the following manner. Groundwater wells were first purged of at least three well volumes prior to sampling. Water samples were then collected using a submersible pump with a 16-gauge needle fitted at the end of the discharge hose. The needle was pushed through a rubber stopper covering an acid-washed vacutainer that was first flushed with nitrogen gas to remove and oxygen, then evacuated with a vacuum pump to establish a negative pressure within the vacutainer. Water samples were stored on ice and transported to the laboratory. Samples were processed for total phosphorus using colorimetery following dry-oxidation/acid hydroloysis methods within 1 to 5 days following sample collection. Salinity of the groundwater and surface water was determined at the time of sampling using an Orion S-C-T meter. Total phosphorus concentrations in 11 groundwater wells ranged from 0.5 to 2.3 uM (16 to 73.6 ug/L-P). Concentrations of total phosphorus in the overlying surface water were consistently lower and ranged from 0.16 to 0.45 uM (5.1 to 14.4 ug/L-P). There was a strong positive correlation between total phosphorus concentrations in the groundwater with salinity (R2=0.6). The results of this investigation indicate enhanced phosphorus concentrations within mixing zone groundwaters underlying the southern Everglades. These concentrations exceed the expected values predicted by conservative mixing of local fresh groundwater and intruding seawater, which both have TP less than 1 uM."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

00066-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Begun in spring 2013, this project is part of a long-term study at the Sevilleta LTER measuring net primary production (NPP) across three distinct ecosystems: creosote-dominant shrubland (Site C), black grama-dominant grassland (Site G), and blue grama-dominant grassland (Site B). Net primary production is a fundamental ecological variable that quantifies rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological processes.Above-ground net primary production is the change in plant biomass, represented by stems, flowers, fruit and and foliage, over time and incoporates growth as well as loss to death and decomposition. To measure this change the vegetation variables in this dataset, including species composition and the cover and height of individuals, are sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots within each site. A third sampling at Site C is performed in the winter. Volumetric measurements are made using vegetation data from permanent plots (SEV289, 'Core Site Grid Quadrat Data for the Net Primary Production Study') and regressions correlating species biomass and volume constructed using seasonal harvest weights from SEV157, 'Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data.'"

This provides seasonal biomass for winter, spring, and fall.Seasonal NPP is derived by subtracting the previous season's biomass from the biomass for the current season. For example, spring NPP is calculated by subtracting the winter weight from the spring weight for each species in a given quadrat. Negative differences are considered to be 0. Likewise, fall production is computed by subtracting spring biomass from fall biomass. Annual biomass is taken as the sum of spring and fall NPP."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

The LTER research is centered on the Gwynns Falls watershed, a 17,150 ha catchment that traverses a gradient from the urban core of Baltimore, through older urban residential (1900 - 1950) and suburban (1950- 1980) zones, rapidly suburbanizing areas and a rural/suburban fringe. Stream temperature is continuously measured throughout the Gwynns Falls watershed along with supplemental sites around Baltimore County/City. A total of 22 sites contain sensors (HOBO Pro v2 Water Temperature Data Logger - U22-001) that take an instantaneous temperature reading every 2 minutes. These data are downloaded on a monthly basis. This dataset is for Reservoir Hill, a stream located in Carney, Maryland. It was delineated using USGS StreamStats, and was intermittently dry throughout the monitoring record. Data for this site should be carefully examined before use. Purpose: Long-term monitoring of stream temperature in a suburban watershed.

00069-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Study Site General description (modified from Benstead et al. 2007): Fertilization of the Kuparuk River with P (added as H3PO4 via continuous dripper from mid-June to mid-August, fixed-rate with a target concentration of 0.3 µM at a nominal discharge of 2 m3/sec) started in the summer of 1983. The H3PO4 was added at an arbitrary point called 0.0 km, located 1.6 km upstream of the river crossing at the Dalton Highway (see Peterson et al., 1985 for early results of fertilization). In subsequent years, all points on the Kuparuk River were referenced relative to this datum. In 1985 the P dripper was moved 0.59 km downstream, forming the first Kuparukrecovery reach (enriched for the two previous summers, 1983-1984) between 0.0 km and 0.59 km. In 1996 the dripper was moved downstream a second time, to 1.4 km below the original dripper site. The reach between 0.59 km and 1.4 km became the second Kuparuk recovery reach (enriched for 13 consecutive summers, 1983-1995). See Slavik et al. (2004) for an summary of other relevant data the Kuparuk River long-term fertilization experiment. The specific reaches represented in this data set come from the following general areas unless noted otherwise: 1992-1995 Fertilized from 0.59km to 18km Reference from 0.5km to -9.5km 1996-2010 Fertilized from 1.6km to 6km Recovery from 1km to 1.39km Reference from -0.47 to 0.7km 2011-Present Fertilized from 1.6km to 6km Re-Fert 2 from 0.7km to 1.39km Re-Fert 1 from 0km to 0.6km Reference from -0.47 to -0.1km Sampling Methods Data were acquired using point transects (Bowden et al. 1994, Bowden et al. 2006). Typically five transects were established across the river at ever sampling station. The transect locations were not permanently monumented and so for sites that were revisited several times a year or over many years, the exact location of the transects vary somewhat. While useful information is contained in the individual transects, statistical comparisons should typically be based on the mean cover values for all transects done at a site as the fundamental reporting unit. At intervals of about 10 cm along each transect, we noted the nature of the plant cover on the cobbles. Three moss species (Schistidium [Grimmia] agassizii Sull. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Lesq. in Sull., a mixture of H. alpestre [Hedw.] Loeske and H. ochraceum [Turn.] Loeske, and Fontinalis neomexicana Sull. &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Lesq.), one liverwort (Solenostoma sp.), and the macroalgae previously mentioned, could be identified easily by eye in the field and were recorded as being present or absent. In subsequent years, other easily recognizable cover categories were recorded (e.g. Lemanea spp., Phormidium spp.). Only one species was assigned to a point. For a typical river width of 15 m, each transect provided roughly 150 points or 750 points at each station. Species frequency was determined from the number of times each species was encountered, divided by the total number of points sampled in a transect. Only one species (or 'bare') was recorded as present at any one point. “Bare” recordings in the field notes were assumed to consist of an epilithic biofilm of diatoms and other microalgae as reported by Miller et al. (1992) and are recorded in the database here as 'Epilithic algae'. In different years slightly different river sites were sometimes measured. Any measured site is a representative sample of the reach from which it came. The dataset contains the 'actual' station location information. However, to consolidate the data and facilitate comparisons among reaches and across years, the data from closely co-located actual stations has been aggregated Arctic LTER Streams Protocol, updated 2014 by JPB pers-1 http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/streams/protocol2.html"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

The tussock tundra plots are located near the Moist Acidic Tundra plots characterized by Shaver and Chapin (1991). The wet sedge plots are located near the outlet of Toolik Lake; all plots have been used by the Arctic LTER project at Toolik Lake. In wet sedge tundra, three 1 m2-sized plots were positioned randomly in each of two treatments of block 2 of the LTER wet sedge scheme (outlet site), control and N+P-fertilized , respectively, in 2000. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N at one of three different dates of the summer season 2001. In moist acidic tussock tundra six 1 m2 sized plots were positioned in three of the 'X' (=extra') blocks of the LTER scheme, in 2001, inside an area extending 5 m from the boardwalks and, positioning plots so that similar area shares between tussocks and intertussock areas was achieved. In each of the three X blocks two 1m2-sized plots were established. The whole 5 m area of the X blocks extending from the board walks was divided into two halfs, each containing one of the 1m2 sized plots. One half was set aside as the control and the other half was designated to be fertilized. Fertilization with a Hoagland solution (see protocol) started in late summer 2001, and was repeated annually after that , early in the summer season. Paired control and fertilized plots were labelled with 14C and 15N of the summer season 2002; all three pairs were labelled as closely together in time as logistically possible. From these plots we collected soil cores, which we removed the root material. The a portion of the cores were placed in sealed mason jars. We fumigated the blank to remove the influce of microbial communities. At set intervals (1 day, 7 days, 3 weeks) we collected the air in the headspace of the mason jar and analyzed on a Shimadzu model 14A gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (FID) for CO2 and CH4 content.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00076-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The Southeast Environmental Research Center at Florida International University operates a network of 331 fixed sampling sites distributed throughout the estuarine and coastal ecosystems of south Florida. The purpose of this network is to address concerns in regional water quality which cross and overlap separate political boundaries. Funding has come from different sources with individual programs being added as funding became available. Biscayne Bay, Florida Bay, Whitewater Bay, Ten Thousand Islands, Rookery Bay, Estero Bay, andPine Island Sound are sampled monthly while the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and the southwest shelf are sampled quarterly. Variables currently being measured include surface and bottom temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, total nitrogen, total organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus, total organic carbon, total silicate, chlorophyll a, alkaline phosphatase activity, turbidity, and light extinction. The purpose of this network is to address concerns in regional water quality which cross and overlap separate political boundaries. One of the products is a quasi-synoptic big picture of nutrient and phytoplankton biomass distributions over the South Florida Coastal Waters. The SERC network will, in time, provide us with the data necessary to determine whether conditions within the estuaries and sanctuary are improving or declining."

00076-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Water samples were collected and analyzed by SERC personnel using standardmethodology outlined in the Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) with prior approval from SFWMD and FDEP. Salinity and temperature (degrees C) were measured 10 cm below the surface and 10 cm above the bottom using a combination salinity-conductivity-temperature probe (Orion model 140). Surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO, mg l-1) was measured using an oxygen electrode (Orion model 840), corrected for both salinity and temperature. Duplicate, unfiltered water samples were collected from 10 cm below the surface using sample rinsed, 120 ml HDPE bottles and kept at ambient temperature in the dark during transport. Duplicate water samples for dissolved nutrient analysis were collected using sample rinsed 150 ml syringes. These samples were filtered by hand (25 mm glass fiber GF/F) into acetone-washed and sample rinsed 60 ml HDPE bottles, which were then capped and immediately placed on ice in the dark for transport. The wet filters, used for chlorophyll a analysis (CHLA), were placed in 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes to which 1.5 ml of 90% acetone was added. They were then immediately capped and put into a dark bottle on ice for transport. Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH<2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples. TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. The APA assay measures the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme used by bacteria to mineralize phosphate from organic compounds. The assay is performed by adding a knownconcentration of an organic phosphate compound (o-methylfluorescein phosphate) to an unfiltered water sample. Alkaline phosphatase in the water sample cleaves the phosphate, leaving o-methylfluorescein, a highly fluorescent compound. The fluorescence of initial and 2 hr incubations were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV spectrofluorometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm) and subtracted to give APA (uM h-1). Turbidity was measured using an HF Scientific model DRT-15C turbidimeter and reported in NTU. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOx), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). Filters for CHLA content (µg l-1) were allowed to extract for a minimum of 2 days at -20degrees C before analysis. Extracts were analyzed using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrofluorometer (excitation = 435 nm, emission = 667 nm) and compared to a standard curve of pure CHLA (Sigma). Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in units of milligrams per liter (mg l-1) or the equivalent parts per million (ppm), except where noted. All nutrient concentrations are based on the atomic weight of primary nutrient species (ppm-N, ppm-P, and ppm-C), not the molecular weight. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis.

Salinity and temperature (degrees C) were measured 10 cm below the surface and 10 cm above the bottom using a combination salinity-conductivity-temperature probe (Orion model 140). Surface and bottom dissolved oxygen (DO, mg l-1) was measured using an oxygen electrode (Orion model 840), corrected for both salinity and temperature. Duplicate, unfiltered water samples were collected from 10 cm below the surface using sample rinsed, 120 ml HDPE bottles and kept at ambient temperature in the dark during transport. Duplicate water samples for dissolved nutrient analysis were collected using sample rinsed 150 ml syringes. These samples were filtered by hand (25 mm glass fiber GF/F) into acetone-washed and sample rinsed 60 ml HDPE bottles, which were then capped and immediately placed on ice in the dark for transport. The wet filters, used for chlorophyll a analysis (CHLA), were placed in 2 ml plastic centrifuge tubes to which 1.5 ml of 90% acetone was added. They were then immediately capped and put into a dark bottle on ice for transport. Unfiltered water samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA), and turbidity (NTU). TOC was measured by direct injection onto hot platinum catalyst in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 after first acidifying to pH<2 and purging with CO2-free air. TN was measured using an ANTEK 7000N Nitrogen Analyzer using O2 as carrier gas instead of argon to promote complete recovery of the nitrogen in the water samples. TP was determined using a dry ashing, acid hydrolysis technique. The APA assay measures the activity of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme used by bacteria to mineralize phosphate from organic compounds. The assay is performed by adding a knownconcentration of an organic phosphate compound (o-methylfluorescein phosphate) to an unfiltered water sample. Alkaline phosphatase in the water sample cleaves the phosphate, leaving o-methylfluorescein, a highly fluorescent compound. The fluorescence of initial and 2 hr incubations were measured using a Gilford Fluoro IV spectrofluorometer (excitation = 430 nm, emission = 507 nm) and subtracted to give APA (uM h-1). Turbidity was measured using an HF Scientific model DRT-15C turbidimeter and reported in NTU. Filtrates were analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), nitrate + nitrite (NOx), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), and silicate (Si(OH)4) by flow injection analysis (Alpkem model RFA 300). Filters for CHLA content (µg l-1) were allowed to extract for a minimum of 2 days at -20degrees C before analysis. Extracts were analyzed using a Gilford Fluoro IV Spectrofluorometer (excitation = 435 nm, emission = 667 nm) and compared to a standard curve of pure CHLA (Sigma). Some parameters were not measured directly, but were calculated by difference. Nitrate (NO3-) was calculated as NOX - NO2-. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) was calculated as NOX + NH4+. Total organic nitrogen (TON) was defined as TN - DIN. Concentrations for all of these water quality variables are reported in units of milligrams per liter (mg l-1) or the equivalent parts per million (ppm), except where noted. All nutrient concentrations are based on the atomic weight of primary nutrient species (ppm-N, ppm-P, and ppm-C), not the molecular weight. All N:P ratios discussed are calculated on a molar basis.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00079-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The LTER moist acidic tussock (Toolik MAT) site was set up in 1989. The experimental design is four blocks of 5 x 20 meter plots with randomly assigned treatments within each block. Treatments include control (CT), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen plus phosphorus (NP). Fertilizer is added annually following snowmelt in June as 10 g/m2 nitrogen (as NH4NO3) and 5 g/m2 phosphorous (as triple superphosphate). Exclosure plots were set up at the MAT site in July 1996 on extra 5 x 20 meter plots within the four-block design of the 1989 LTER acidic tussock experimental plots. On each plot a 5 x 10 meter section was fenced with large mesh (4-inch square mesh) and within this fence a 5x5-meter plot was fenced with a small mesh (1/2-inch square mesh). In each block two fenced plots were setup: a plot with no fertilizer and a plot with annual fertilization treatments as described above. Thus the treatments created are no fence, no fertilizer (NFCT); small mesh fence, no fertilizer (SFCT); large mesh fence, no fertilizer (LFCT); no fence, N plus P (NFNP); small mesh fence, N plus P (SFNP); and large mesh fence, N plus P (LFNP). In 2006, a new set of experimental treatments were established in MAT near the earlier plots described above. These include a gradient of fertilization treatments that receive nitrate or ammonium alone, or receive N and P additions with 0.5, 1, 2, 5, or 10 g N added with half of that amount added as P. Only Blocks 1-3 of the 2006 plots were sampled. For this dataset, only the CT and NP plots were sampled in each of the three sets of experiments (set up in 1989, 1996, and 2006). The 1996 NP plots are the NFNP plots described above, and the 2006 NP plots are the 10gN plots (F10) described above. Calculations: none Sampling Description.On each sampling date, a metal thaw depth probe with centimeter increments was inserted in 3-5 random locations within each plot. Once the probe hit permafrost, the value for depth of thaw was recorded. Immediately adjacent to this sampling, a hand-held soil thermometer was inserted to a depth of 5 cm and the temperature was recorded. If thaw exceeded 10 cm, a second soil temperature measurement was made at 10 cm depth. Protocol pers-1"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict.

Sensors used: Wind speed and direction RM Young 05103 Wind monitor Data is recorded using a YSI DCP 6200 data collection platform with Zeno datalogger and Ecowatch software . Wind speed and direction are instantaneous measurements at 15 minute intervals. YSI DCP 6200 and Ecowatch software did not have program capability for 5 sec wind measurements and calculated 15 min averages, nor capability for determining max wind speed at a specific time. RM Young 05103, Sensor is mounted on top of 15 ft pole which is mounted on top of IBYC pier deck railing secured to a post. Height Pole 15 ft Railing 3.3 ft above deck Deck is ~22.5 ft above sediment bottom High tide water level ~ 16 ft Sensor is 40.8 ft above water bottom or ~ 24 ft (7 meters) above high tide water level Installation of RM Young 05103 Wind Sensor at IBYC, December 20, 2005 The sensor and mounting pipe were attached next to the existing RF antenna pole used for the YSI sonde radio transmission. The mounting pipe consisted of three, five foot galvanized threaded pipes, ¾” diameter coupled together. A 1” to ¾” reducing fitting was attached to the top to accommodate the 1” diameter fitting for the sensor. Junction box facing “South”, 180 degrees opposite true North (16 degree declination from magnetic North). Ecowatch software, new configuration file (IBYCMet.s62) set up for the sensor. Initially set up to record wind speed and direction every 3 minutes and radiotransmit every 15 minutes. When the sondes are reconnected in the Spring of 2006, the IBYCChl.s62 config file will need to have the MET sensors added to it. Since the DO readings are measured on 15 minute intervals, the wind will also have to be measured on that same interval, Ecowatch can not have different measurement time intervals for different sensors. Zeno datalogger with YSI set up not capable of taking measurments every 5 seconds and then averaging for 15 minutes as with Campbell dataloggers and weather stations. On September 19, 15:15, 2011 the YSI Data Collection Platform (DCP 6200 with Zeno datalogger) was replaced with a Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger and LoggerNet software. Measurements conducted at 5 second intervals and 15 minute averages recorded in the CR1000. See data file MON-SO-Met15min2011b for the remainder of 2011, September 19 to December 31, 2011."

Height Pole 15 ft Railing 3.3 ft above deck Deck is ~22.5 ft above sediment bottom High tide water level ~ 16 ft Sensor is 40.8 ft above water bottom or ~ 24 ft (7 meters) above high tide water level Installation of RM Young 05103 Wind Sensor at IBYC, December 20, 2005 The sensor and mounting pipe were attached next to the existing RF antenna pole used for the YSI sonde radio transmission. The mounting pipe consisted of three, five foot galvanized threaded pipes, ¾” diameter coupled together. A 1” to ¾” reducing fitting was attached to the top to accommodate the 1” diameter fitting for the sensor. Junction box facing “South”, 180 degrees opposite true North (16 degree declination from magnetic North). Ecowatch software, new configuration file (IBYCMet.s62) set up for the sensor. Initially set up to record wind speed and direction every 3 minutes and radiotransmit every 15 minutes. When the sondes are reconnected in the Spring of 2006, the IBYCChl.s62 config file will need to have the MET sensors added to it. Since the DO readings are measured on 15 minute intervals, the wind will also have to be measured on that same interval, Ecowatch can not have different measurement time intervals for different sensors. Zeno datalogger with YSI set up not capable of taking measurments every 5 seconds and then averaging for 15 minutes as with Campbell dataloggers and weather stations. On September 19, 15:15, 2011 the YSI Data Collection Platform (DCP 6200 with Zeno datalogger) was replaced with a Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger and LoggerNet software. Measurements conducted at 5 second intervals and 15 minute averages recorded in the CR1000. See data file MON-SO-Met15min2011b for the remainder of 2011, September 19 to December 31, 2011."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

Water wasfiltered in the field using 47mm .045 um millipore HAE filters. Phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate/nitrite samples were kept at 4 C in amber HDPE bottles untilbeing run on an ALP chem auto analyzer . TDN samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N ultrex HCL, shipped to MBL, and stored at -20 C. Dissolved organic N was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chemm autoanalyzer using a packed cadmium column and RFA method number AS303-S171-09 . DOP samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N ultrex HCL, shipped to MBL, and stored at 4 C.Dissolved organic P was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chem autoanalyzer using RFA methods Particulate Phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon samples were collected on precombusted 25 mm GF/F filters. Filters were dried overnight at 55 C prior to shipment and stored in ziplock freezer bags. Particulate phosphorus was determined using methods of Stainton et al., (1974). Particulate Nitrogen and carbon were run on a Perkin elmer CHN analyzer. Reference Citations: R.G. Wetzel and G.E. Likens. 1979. Limnological Methods. Saunders.

Water wasfiltered in the field using 47mm .045 um millipore HAE filters. Phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate/nitrite samples were kept at 4 C in amber HDPE bottles untilbeing run on an ALP chem auto analyzer . TDN samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N ultrex HCL, shipped to MBL, and stored at -20 C. Dissolved organic N was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chemm autoanalyzer using a packed cadmium column and RFA method number AS303-S171-09 . DOP samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N ultrex HCL, shipped to MBL, and stored at 4 C.Dissolved organic P was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chem autoanalyzer using RFA methods Particulate Phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon samples were collected on precombusted 25 mm GF/F filters. Filters were dried overnight at 55 C prior to shipment and stored in ziplock freezer bags. Particulate phosphorus was determined using methods of Stainton et al., (1974). Particulate Nitrogen and carbon were run on a Perkin elmer CHN analyzer. Reference Citations: R.G. Wetzel and G.E. Likens. 1979. Limnological Methods. Saunders.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Characterizations were done using PCR-RFLP on the nifD-K spacer region of the Frankia genome. The position of each plant and each nodule were mapped in order to examine spatial patterns in Frankia distribution within sites. Soil chemistry data, including C, N, P, and pH, were also collected from mineral and organic layers."

00085-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design This study included 3 replicate early succession and 3 late succession sites in order to examine the effect of successional habitat on Frankia assemblage structure, spatial distribution of individual genotypes, and partitioning of Frankia diversity within and among host plants and sampling sites. Methods FIELD: A 100 m transect was established in each site, perpendicular to the river when possible. 20 plants were selected along the transect by using randomly generated distances along and from the transect, and a random direction (right or left of the transect). Each plant was randomly assigned to be intensively sampled (10 nodules collected) or extensively sampled (1 nodule collected). All nodules were surface-sterilized in the field by immersion in 10% bleach + alconox for 1 min, followed by 3 1-min rinses in DI water. At every other plant, a single soil core (5 cm dia x 10 cm depth) was collected within 0.5 m of the plant, separated into organic and mineral layers, and placed on dry ice. LAB: Nodules were characterized via PCR-RFLP. Nodules were first lyophilized, then ground on a Retch shaker mill. DNA was extracted using the Dneasy Plant Tissue kit from Qiagen with addition of lysozyme and an additional incubation at 37 C immediately following the lysis step. The nifD-K noncoding spacer was amplified via PCR, and the product subjected to individual 8 h digests with the restriction enzymes HaeIII and CfoI. Digest products were electrophoresed on 2% Nusieve + 1% Seakem gels, and 'RF' designations assigned based on visually-determined unique fragment patterns. Soil pH was measured on a 1:1 slurry of soil and deionized water. Total N and C were determined with a CN autoanalyzer (LECO Corporation, St. Joseph MI). Total phosphorus was determined colorimetrically using the molydenum blue method with an amino-napthtol-sulfonic acid reducing agent (Jackson 1958). All soil variables were determined separately for organic and mineral horizons."

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The CSASN goal was to quantify the relative influences of through flow, lateral inputs, and hyporheic regeneration on the seasonal fluxes C, N, and P in an arctic river network, and to determine how these influences might shift under seasonal conditions that are likely to be substantially different in the future. Point transects were done throughout the sampling season to determine different substrate and cover types on the stream bottom."

While useful information is contained in the individual transects, statistical comparisons should typically be based on the mean cover values for all transects done at a site as the fundamental reporting unit. At intervals of about 10 cm or 20cm along each transect, the substrate and cover type were noted. In 2010 and 2011, transects were completed for both I8Out and I8In. Significant amounts of didymo were recorded on these reaches. A 'thickness qualifier' was approximated estimating how thick the didymo was. Sporadic Didymo was given a '0' rating; thin didymo (<5mm) was given a '1' rating, and thick (>5mm) was given a '2' rating. The values present in this file show what percentage of the total didymo fell into each category for every individual transect. Exposed rock above the present water level within a transect was counted throughout all the reaches, but removed for this file. Mosses such as Schistidium, Solenostoma, and Hygrohypnum were analyzed individually on the Kuparuk River in 2012. In terms of simplicity, these three were consolidated into the moss category. Lemanea was put in the same category as Green Filamentous Algae (GF). Other findings included Orthocladius, vascular plants, and Phormidium. These were placed in the 'Other' category.If you wish to have these more detailed parameters about the Kuparuk River, please refer to the LTER Moss Transect file currently named '19932010Kuparuk_Moss'. This file is updated every year. Any measured site is a representative sample of the reach from which it came. The dataset contains the 'actual' station location information.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Data are reported for microsatellite markers from individual giant kelp plants from Carpinteria Reef, Mohawk Reef and Goleta Bay, collected during September 2009. Relative X and Y coordinates (meters) were recorded for each specimen sampled. R code consists of two scripts, a) to calculate mean number of alleles per locus, and observed and expected heterozygosity, and b) to simulate self-fertilization and sibling/cousin relationships. These data were presented in: Johansson, Mattias L, Raimondi, Peter T, Reed, Daniel C, Coelho, Nelson C, SerrÃ£o, Ester A, Alberto, Filipe A. In press. Looking into the black box: simulating the role of self-fertilization and mortality in the genetic structure of Macrocystis pyrifera. Molecular Ecology, 22:4842â4854.

As in many temperate regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs. Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.

As in many temperate regions, the shallow rocky reefs in the Santa Barbara Channel, California, are dominated by giant kelp forests. Because of their close proximity to shore, kelp forests are influenced by physical and biological processes occurring on land as well as in the open ocean. SBC LTER research focuses on measuring and modeling the patterns, transport, and processing of material constituents (e.g., nutrients, carbon, sediment, organisms, and pollutants) from terrestrial watersheds and the coastal ocean to these reefs. Specifically, we are examining the effects of these material inputs on the primary production of kelp, and the population dynamics, community structure, and trophic interactions of kelp forest ecosystems.

00089-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Water samples were collected at depths 0,1,3,5,8,12,16 meters with a Van Dorn. Water wasfiltered in the field using 47mm .045 um millipore HAE filters. Phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate/nitrite samples were kept at 4 C in amber HDPE bottles untilbeing run on an ALP chem auto analyzer . TDN samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N HCL and shipped to MBL. Total dissolved organic N was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chem autoanalyzer using a packed cadmium column and RFA method number AS303-S171-09 . TDP samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N HCL and shipped to MBL. Total dissolved organic P was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chem autoanalyzer using RFA methods Particulate Phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon samples were collected on precombusted 25 mm GF/F filters.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Water wasfiltered in the field using 47mm .045 um millipore HAE filters. Phosphorus, ammonia and nitrate/nitrite samples were kept at 4 C in amber HDPE bottles untilbeing run on an ALP chem auto analyzer . TDN samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N ultrex HCL, shipped to MBL, and stored at -20 C. Dissolved organic N was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chemm autoanalyzer using a packed cadmium column and RFA method number AS303-S171-09 . DOP samples were fixed with 1 ul/ml 6N ultrex HCL, shipped to MBL, and stored at 4 C.Dissolved organic P was digested with potassium persulfate and determined on an alp chem autoanalyzer using RFA methods Particulate Phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon samples were collected on precombusted 25 mm GF/F filters. Filters were dried overnight at 55 C prior to shipment and stored in ziplock freezer bags. Particulate phosphorus was determined using methods of Stainton et al., (1974). Particulate Nitrogen and carbon were run on a Perkin elmer CHN analyzer. Reference Citations: R.G. Wetzel and G.E. Likens. 1979. Limnological Methods. Saunders.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

00092-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"A variety of mechanisms, both anthropogenic and natural, can lead to changes in the vegetation composition of a community. In semi- desert grasslands, for example, Schlesinger et al. (1990) suggested that overgrazing can result in desertification through a shift from primarily grasses to desert shrubs. Changes in plant communities can also occur as a result of introduced species, artificial watering, plant removal for human use, disease, competition, and prolonged drought. In the future, global problems, such as the greenhouse effect, could possibly lead to climate changes (and therefore changes in vegetation) that we can only attempt to predict. Changes in plant composition have the potential to cause disturbances in both structure and function throughout the ecosystem. One element of the ecosystem that could possibly be affected is bird diversity and behavior. Several studies such as Dixon (1959), Raitt and Pimm (1976), Naranjo and Raitt (1993), MacAurthur et al. (1962), Vander Wall and MacMahon (1984) and Raitt and Maze (1968), all suggest that certain species of birds depend more, or entirely, on habitats containing specific functional groups or species of vegetation. According to Naranjo and Raitt (1993), habitat preferences in birds develop because of factors such as availability of food, nesting and perching locations, and cover. Birds may utilize some plant species more than other plant species. Vander Wall and MacMahon (1984) suggest that some particular plant species are ideally suited to particular bird species. For example, the northern mockingbird relies on tall plants for perching and singing sites. Other plant species provide cover for birds like the Gambel's Quail. Certain species of birds may also use a wider variety of different plants because of broad habitat requirements. In this study we examine how different types of plant types and growth affect bird abundance, bird species diversity, and bird activity in the Chihuahuan desert."

The Jornada Basin LTER shall not be liable for damages resulting from any use or misinterpretation of data sets. Quality Assurance Policy: Data managers interact with researchers during the entire scientific process--from the initial planning of sampling designs and field data collection to archiving and distribution of data. The goal of data management is to build and maintain an archive of Jornada Basin LTER data files that are fully documented, error free, and organized in useful ways. Our protocol for data collection and processing seeks maximum interaction between researchers and data management personnel to avoid confusion and potential loss of data or problems with integrity of data; e.g., identification of historical site treatments that may impact a proposed study or incomplete data set variable descriptions. Site and Data Manager involvement begins during the Project Design phase with the completion of the Jornada Notification of Research form by the researcher prior to the start of work; this alerts both Site and Data Manager to the new study and potential LTER data sets. Upon initiation of a new study, the researcher completes Project Documentation that provides the second level of 'metadata' documentation. In the Data Collection phase, the data manager helps researchers design field and laboratory data sheets that facilitate data entry and analysis. Prior to JIMS data entry the investigator completes Data Set Documentation to provide the metadata that fully describe the data set. Both Project and Data set documentation are provided with the data set when it is requested or obtained from our Web site. JIMS data entry programs error-check and verify data as they are entered. Computer files are subjected to further verification by graphing and/or error-checking programs, and/or examination by field investigators. Final quality assurance of the data rests with the investigator who submits data for inclusion in the Data Management System. Direct communication with the Site Manager, or through a collaborating JRN P.I., is used to encourage the timely submission of documentation and of data by researchers. Error-checked data files are stored with associated documentation files on the file server. Archived data files are maintained in ASCII format on 30-yr magneto-optical (MO) disks, portable hard drives, CD-R media, and DVD media to guard against loss of data access that can result from changing technology. This may also include proprietary binary format files to facilitate recovery of working versions. Image data are archived on 8mm tape. Routine tape data backups of the file server are done daily, weekly, and monthly. One set of off-site copies are maintained elsewhere on the NMSU campus of routine backup tapes, MO disks, CD disks, and DVD disks with a second set of MO, CD and DVD disks maintained off-campus in case of a catastrophe on campus. The final responsibility for quality assurance (both in data and documentation content) rests with the principal investigator who submits the data for inclusion in the Jornada Basin LTER Information Management System. To facilitate quality assurance, the data manag ement staff will provide copies of data and documentation submitted by a principal investigator to that investigator upon request.

Policy on Submission of data: Data submission into JIMS is expected from LTER researchers, LTER collaborators, and their graduate students where data and information is derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established. Other Jornada Basin researchers are encouraged to submit their documented data for inclusion within JIMS to provide them with an archived backup, ensure its longevity, and provide online access to encourage synthesis efforts. Minimally, for non-LTER associated researchers, we request that publications be provided of research conducted on the Jornada Basin. Initial documentation for a data set must be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager within 90 days of initiation of data collection. Documentation forms are available at http://jornada-www.nmsu.edu/site/dm/readme.php . These consist of Project Abstract and Data Set and Attribute documentation forms, which include objectives of the study, methods, as well as format and content of the data. All data collected during a calendar year should be submitted to the Jornada Basin LTER data manager prior to July first of the following year. First time data submissions must be submitted with updated standard Jornada Basin LTER forms previously submitted. Data Access Policy: Data will be made publicly available no later than 2 years after submission of the data unless an earlier date is specified by the principal investigator. In the event that an extension of the 2 year period is necessary, the principal investigator may petition the Jornada Basin LTER Executive Committee for a longer protected period.

00092-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Observations (using binoculars) of birds and their behavior were recorded on field data sheets. The experiment took place on the Biodiversity plots at the New Mexico State University Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center from June through August 1997. The site contained 6 blocks, each containing 8 treatments. The treatments consisted of plots of land (25m x25m) which had been altered by removing plant types in a systematic fashion. Species were removed based on plant functional group and species dominance within the community. Birds were observed in each plot for periods of 35 minutes with a 10 minute acclimation period prior to the start of the observation period. The acclimation period was meant to allow time for birds to settle and to orient the observer. Observations started at sunrise and ended between and 8:30 and 9:00 am. In all cases, observer movement was coordinated so as not to disturb other observers. Four observers participated each day, each observing a total of four plots. They watched (using binoculars) their assigned plot from a step ladder at the corner of the plot in order to get a better view of the entire plot. Also, in order to help the observers distinguish between adjacent plots, markers were placed around the perimeter of the plots. These markers were put in place the day before and then promptly taken down so that ecosystem function was not disrupted. An attempt was made to choose and place the markers so as not to frighten or attract the birds in any way. The following data were recorded in each plot: species type, time spent in plot, type of vegetation utilized, presence of a pair or family group, and behavior. Behaviors recorded included perching, singing, calling, foraging on the ground, foraging in the vegetation, nesting , and preening. Birds that simply flew over the plot or that landed on the plot boundaries were not counted. There were four replications over the course of ten weeks. The replications were done according to a predetermined schedule which was developed in such a manner so as to reduce sampling error as much as possible. In order to do this, the following were avoided: replications of the same plot at the same time of day, replicating all of the 6 similar treatments on the same day, and having the same observer do more than one of the replications of a single plot.

00092-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Observations (using binoculars) of birds and their behavior were recorded on field data sheets. The experiment took place on the Biodiversity plots at the New Mexico State University Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center from June through August 1997. The site contained 6 blocks, each containing 8 treatments. The treatments consisted of plots of land (25m x25m) which had been altered by removing plant types in a systematic fashion. Species were removed based on plant functional group and species dominance within the community. Birds were observed in each plot for periods of 35 minutes with a 10 minute acclimation period prior to the start of the observation period. The acclimation period was meant to allow time for birds to settle and to orient the observer. Observations started at sunrise and ended between and 8:30 and 9:00 am. In all cases, observer movement was coordinated so as not to disturb other observers. Four observers participated each day, each observing a total of four plots. They watched (using binoculars) their assigned plot from a step ladder at the corner of the plot in order to get a better view of the entire plot. Also, in order to help the observers distinguish between adjacent plots, markers were placed around the perimeter of the plots. These markers were put in place the day before and then promptly taken down so that ecosystem function was not disrupted. An attempt was made to choose and place the markers so as not to frighten or attract the birds in any way. The following data were recorded in each plot: species type, time spent in plot, type of vegetation utilized, presence of a pair or family group, and behavior. Behaviors recorded included perching, singing, calling, foraging on the ground, foraging in the vegetation, nesting , and preening. Birds that simply flew over the plot or that landed on the plot boundaries were not counted. There were four replications over the course of ten weeks. The replications were done according to a predetermined schedule which was developed in such a manner so as to reduce sampling error as much as possible. In order to do this, the following were avoided: replications of the same plot at the same time of day, replicating all of the 6 similar treatments on the same day, and having the same observer do more than one of the replications of a single plot.

This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

We quantify metabolic rates of periphyton assemblages using standard oxygen change techniques in 300mL light and dark BOD bottles in triplicate. Using YSI dissolved oxygen probes and meters, we measure dissolved oxygen change as the difference of initial and final oxygen concentrations over a two hour incubation. We calculate net primary productivity and respiration rates in units of oxygen and carbon, then normalize to the organic content (ash free dry weight) of the incubated periphyton."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual âupside-downâ productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

00096-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"On 7 January 2010, a SonTek Argonaut-XR 1.5 MHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was fixed at the bottom of the lake ice in the Lake Hoare Limno Hole inside the Polar Haven, looking downward through the water column. Every 10 seconds, the ADCP measured horizontal and vertical current velocities in ten, 30-cm-thick cells between 0.5 and 3.5 m below the lake ice. Over 32.5 hours, horizontal currents in the shallowest cell (0.5 to 0.8 m below lake ice) had a mean speed of 23.8 cm/sec. This speed was independently validated by lowering a SonTek handheld Acoustic Doppler Velocity (ADV) meter into the ice hole. Horizontal speeds oscillated between 10.1 and 37.5 cm/sec over the course of the ADCP dataset. Fast Fourier Transforms of x-direction velocity data from the shallowest cell identified oscillation periods of 11, 3.7, and 2.5 minutes consistent with the theoretical first-mode longitudinal surface seiche in Lake Hoare. Current direction oscillated between N 78 degrees E and N 289 degrees E along the east-west longitudinal axis of the lake, consistent with the behavior of a seiche."

00097-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"2013"
00097-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Densities of ungulates are often associated with recent forest disturbances such as fire, logging and insect outbreaks, as increased resources stimulate tree regeneration, leading to abundant available browse. Despite the often significant role that ungulates play in disturbed forests, surprisingly little is known about ungulate-disturbance interactions, and ungulate herbivory is often excluded from examinations of forest response to disturbance. In the Northeastern United States, a large-scale insect outbreak, the hemlock wooly adelgid (HWA), has begun to have important effects on hemlock forests both directly and indirectly (i.e., by preemptive salvage logging). No studies have examined the interactions of both moose and deer activity with these associated canopy disturbances. Our objectives are twofold: to determine (1) the response of ungulates to varying disturbance types and intensities and (2) the influence of ungulate interactions with canopy disturbance on vegetation, other biota, and ecosystem processes. We will examine the relative abundance of moose and deer in four treatments (2 replicates) at the Hemlock Removal Experiment using three indices of ungulate activity: pellet group density, evidence of past browsing on seedlings and saplings, and the occurrence of animals using game cameras. We will also monitor the response of vegetation to ungulate browsing by sampling woody and herbaceous vegetation in fenced exclosures and paired controls in disturbed and undisturbed plots."

00097-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Exclosures A single 15x30m exclosure was erected in the center of each of the eight, 90m x 90m treatment plots at the Hemlock Removal Experiment at Simes in the Fall of 2011. Paired 450 m2control plots were established adjacent to the exclosures. Pre-exclosure data on tree regeneration and browsing were gathered in 2008 using an 8 x 3 grid of 4m2 circular subplots (96m2 total) in both the control and exclosure plots. Woody Regeneration In each of the 24 subplots in the fenced and unfenced plots, tree and upright shrub seedlings at least 30 cm and less than 2.5 cm DBH are recorded, identified, and measured for height. Regeneration for at least 2.5 cm DBH is measured for DBH. Low Shrubs and Herbaceous Vegetation In each of the 24 subplots in the fenced and unfenced plots, the percent cover of graminoids, Rubus, Fern, Forb, and Ericaceous shrubs are estimated using the following cover classes: 0 = absent, 1 = 1-24%, 2= 25-49%, 3 = 50-74%, 4 = 75-100%. Browsing Each woody stem at least 30 cm and no more than 3m is assessed for past browsing by estimating the percentage of twigs branching off the main stem that are browsed. Stems are assigned to one of the following browsing classes: (0 = none, 1=1-33% twigs browsed, 2 = 34-66% twigs browsed, 3 = 67-100% twigs browsed). Browsers are identified as either U for ungulate (torn, ragged, squared off bite), P for porcupine (45 degree angle clean cut), or UP if both browsers have foraged on the stem. For stems above maximum browse height (3m), legacies of past browsing are assessed by recording the number and heights of crooks (resulting from a single lateral bud replacing damaged terminal shoot) and forks (two lateral buds that have replaced damaged terminal twig) on the stem. Pellet Groups Pellet Groups are sampled in each of the 15 x 30 m control plots using five 3x30 m belt transects. Two observers walk the transects in tandem and record pellet groups. A group is defined as having at least 15 pellets. Pellet groups are sampled once a year (or once every other year) without removal so as not to disturb other measurements such as soil characteristics and vegetation growth that may be influenced by ungulate pellet deposition. Game Cameras Game Cameras are installed on the post of each exclosure (approximately in the center of the plot at 1.5 m high) facing into the control plot. Cameras are checked bi-weekly for pictures and average visitation time to plots (per week), total time recorded in plots, and average duration of single visits will be determined for moose, deer, and other wildlife."

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

00099-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The Toolik Lake Field Station (TLFS) and Sagavanirktok River-Department of Transportation camp (SDOT) sites were deglaciated ~65,000 yr BP, following the Itkillik I glaciation (Hamilton 2002). The Imnavait Creek (IMVT) site was deglaciated ~120,000 yr BP, following the Sagavanirktok River glaciation (Hamilton 2002). Snow cameras were mounted on tripod assemblages, ~ 5 meters from the ground to capture landscape-level images four times daily in the Shrub plots at each of the four sites. The Shrub plots represent a gradient of shrub statures, with maximum deciduous shrub heights of approximately 22 cm (IMVT), 35 cm (TLFS) and 84 cm (SDOT) (Rich et al. 2013). Differences among Shrub plots are related to topography and water flow. The IMVT Shrub plot, which has the shortest shrubs of the three sites, is associated with water movement because it is located in an area with water tracks, and the site represents vegetation typical of water track tundra as described in Chapin et al. (1988). The TLFS Shrub plot, which has medium stature shrubs, is located at the outlet of Toolik Lake, where proximity to a large body of water, substrate conditions, and the presence of large rocks may promote root lengthening and shrub growth. The TLFS Shrub plot represents vegetation typical of shrub tundra described in Shaver &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Chapin (1991). The SDOT Shrub plot, which has tall and structurally complex shrubs, is a riparian community (Rich et al. 2013). The Shrub plot at SDOT has the deepest thaw depths among all of our plots and represents vegetation typical of riverside shrub tundra as described in Giblin et al. (1991), which tend to have deeper thaw depths compared to other tundra vegetation communities (Shaver &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Chapin 1991). Snow cameras are installed in mid-May and digital photos are used to quantify snow cover through the melt period. Cameras rented from SID Inc. are removed and shipped back to SID Inc. once snowmelt in the field of view of the camera is complete (or near complete, <5% snow cover remaining). The photos are taken every day, either once or three times per day, depending on the site and camera being used. The following describes the cameras being used at each field site. The photos show what their field of view should be when set up each year, and the below table gives a summary of which camera(s) was (were) used in which year at each site. TLFS: We are using two cameras at this field site: (1) the EDC’s Brooks Range Camera which is an Axis 206W Wireless Network Camera. The system is permanently mounted inside Winter Quarters and faces south towards the Brooks Mountain Range and takes a photo every day at 12 noon. Field of view of the camera can be seen at the following URL: http://toolik.alaska.edu/edc/daily_images/web_cam_archive.php?camera=brooks); (2) our own camera rented from SID Inc. (NetCam SC, StarDOT Technologies, CA, USA). The camera is mounted at 3.32 m above ground and is located upslope of our Shrub plots at TLFS and takes a photo every day at approximately 6am, 12 noon and 6pm. IMVT: We are using our own camera rented from SID Inc. (NetCam SC, StarDOT Technologies, CA, USA). The camera is mounted at 3.54 m above ground and is located upslope of our Shrub plots at IMVT and takes a photo every day at approximately 6am, 12 noon and 6pm. SDOT: We are using our own camera rented from SID Inc. (NetCam SC, StarDOT Technologies, CA, USA). The camera is mounted at 3.32 m above ground and is located south of and adjacent to our Shrub plots at SDOT and takes a photo every day at approximately 6am, 12 noon and 6pm. Post-processing and analysis of photos was done using ENVI remote sensing software and in Excel, and the fraction of snow cover in each image on each day was calculated: Fraction snow cover = (# snow covered pixels) / (# snow covered pixels + # snow free pixels). This was converted to a percent by multiplying by 100. Reference Citations: Chapin, F.S.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.
