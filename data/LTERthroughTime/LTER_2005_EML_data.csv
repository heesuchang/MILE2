LTER_2005,EML,00000-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Soil respiration measurements were made using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA; EGM-4 gas analyzer, PP Systems, Haverhill, MA) with a dynamic soil respiration chamber (SRC-2, PP Systems). Respiration collars (18) were randomly located on three 20 x 20 m sampling grids (separate from WSOC collection) at each site. The respiration collars (10.2 cm diameter schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride) were inserted to a depth of 2.5 cm at least 1 week prior to initial measurements and were left in place for the duration of the experiment. Care was taken to ensure that the collars remained at the same depth throughout the measurement period. All vascular plants were removed from the collars prior to measuring. Measurements were made approximately bi-weekly at each site, from May through September in 2004 (n = 5 or 6). A portable thermometer was used to measure soil temperature at 10 cm below the surface concurrently with soil respiration measured at each collar. Changes in collar-specific air volumes (caused by changes in microtopography and the presence of moss) were measured directly through use of the ideal gas law by injecting 25 cm-3 of 3500 mg m-3 CO2 into the soil respiration chamber and measuring the subsequent dilution of CO2 concentration with the IRGA. All flux values have been adjusted for these collar specific volumes.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00001-metadata.xml,Process Step,"A Campbell CR21x datalogger, in the LTER acidic experimental plots (block 2), is used to monitor weather and soil temperatures. Sensors in the control plot include: global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, unfrozen precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction at 3 meters. Additional seasons in greenhouses and shade houses plots measure air temperature, relative humidity and photosynthetically active radiation during the growing season. These sensors are read every minute and averaged or totaled every hour. Two profiles of soil temperature are measured per treatment plot with copper/constantin thermocouple wires (TC) installed at depths of 10, 20, and 40 cm in inter-tussock areas. The following label codes are used: CT = control, GH = greenhouses, SH = shade houses, F = fertilized, GF= greenhouse fertilized, SF = shade house fertilized, plus a 1 or a 2 for the profile number. All soil sensors are read every 15 minutes and averaged every 3 hours. Hourly, three hourly and daily summaries are in files yyDLTUH.DAT, yyDLTUO.DAT, and yDLTUD.DAT respectively, where yy is the year in which the data are collected. The original data are in file yyDLTDAT.ZIP which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. Note: The covers on greenhouses and shade houses are removed every fall and reinstalled every spring. Notes: Soil temperatures are problematic since frost heaving of the probes caused depth of measurements to change. The soil probes are checked every August and adjusted if possible. Depth changes and whether the TCs are reset are noted in the Comment variable. Most frost heaving may occur it spring. Wind speeds less then 0.447 are considered calm. For the global solar radiation and photosynthetically active radiation sensors no attempt is made to correct for frost or snow on the sensors during the winter months.

Cation samples are stored at 4 C in 60 ml HDPE bottles and are preserved by acidifying to ~ pH 2 (100 ul Ultrex HCL / 60 ml sample. Anion samples are stored at 4 C in 30 HDPE bottles. Alkalinity was measured using a Gran titration (Strum and Morgan, 1984). Cation samples are run on a Perkin Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Chemical interference in flame AAS originates during dissociation of the analyte in the flame cell forming a compound that volatilizes at a different rate than the standard. One method of alleviating this type of interference is through the addition of a releasing agent or protective chelate. A releasing agent is a metal or salt that forms a more stable compound with the interferent than the analyte. For calcium analysis the addition of lanthanum, which acts a releasing agent and reduces interference with the calcium peak from Al, Si, PO43-, and SO42- is required (Rains, 1984). Lanthanum Chloride (LaCL3 FW 371.38) should be added to a 1% final concentration to all samples and standards. 10% LaCL3 = 37.13 g / liter.

Vertical CTD profiles were collected at approximately 2km intervals from 0km to 36km during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure, optical back scatter, photosynthetically-available radiation, oxygen and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected during the upcast were deleted. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

The data then underwent a quality control process, which included removal of the soaking time period, removal of decreasing pressure during the profile due to ship and wave motion, removal of the upcast information (i.e. data after the instrument has hit bottom), removal of spikes in any of the parameters, application of flow-through time delays for the oxygen (0.5 s) and fluormeter (3.75 s) sensors, calculation of PAR depth to account for the physical separation between the PAR and pressure sensors (~0.75m).

Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

All vascular species were sorted, divided into new and old growth, dried, and weighed. Lichens were separated by genus in all quadrats. In half of the quadrats (n=4), mosses were separated by species. Moss and lichen data are presented by species elsewhere (see 97lgmosslichen.txt).",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00015-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Plots were established in homogeneous vegetation in each of the communities at each site. Slope and aspect were as consistent as possible across the site locations. Eight 3 x 3 m plots were established and the corner of focus was chosen randomly. For harvest, a 20 cm x 20 cm quadrat was placed 20 cm away from the corner edges and all aboveground plant material was harvested. In the lab plant material was separated into lichen, moss, and vascular species. Lichens were separated to genus. In 4 quadrats at each community within each site, mosses were separated by species. In the other 4 mosses were lumped for total biomass only. Vascular species had belowground material removed, and were divided into current year?s growth and old growth. Harvesting and separating were conducted from 25 July through 1 August, 1997. All specimens were dried for at least 48 hours at 60 degrees C and weighed. Samples were then returned to Woods Hole, Mass. for nutrient analysis. Supplemental Harvest (see 1997lgrarespbm.txt): In addition to the above harvest, a separate harvest was conducted in order to determine productivity of rare species not found in at least 4 quadrats per site. These species were selected based on the species measured for leaf level photosynthesis in summer 1997. A 1 m^2 quadrat with 20 x 20 cm areas marked off was used to determine visual percent cover of each of these species within the 9 m2 plots. Subsequently the same quadrat was placed on an area outside the plots, percent cover was estimated, and all aboveground biomass of the targeted species was harvested. This was done 4 times at each site/community for each species. The plant material was then processed in the same way as the other harvest.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

LTER_2005,EML,00016-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Water Collection Water samples were collected from the R/V Savannah approximately 1 meter below the surface using a Niskin bottle sampler deployed using a hydrographic winch. The water sample was then transferred to brown 1 L Nalgene bottles, which were pre-rinsed once with approximately 100 ml of sample water prier to filling. Surface samples collected from the R/V Salty Dawg and Carolina Skiff were collected by hand approximately 0.5 meters below the surface of the water using a brown 1 L Nalgene bottle rinsed once with sample water. Sample Incubation Four sterile 2 ml centrifuge tubes were individually numbered and 5µL of leucine stock solution (20 nM final concentration) was added to each tube [L-(4-5) 3H-Leucine Amersham corparation cat# TRK510, ca. 150mCi/mmol]. Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) was added to the first tube in each series (89µl of 100% TCA, final concentration of 5%) to function as a killed control. 1.7ml of sample was added into each tube, and the tubes were vortexed and incubated at ambient tempertures for one hour. At the end of the incubation period live samples were fixed with 89 ul 100% TCA and vortexed. Samples were then stored refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for processing. (reference: Smith, D.C., Azam, F., 1992. A simple, economical method for measuring bacterial protein synthesis rates in seawater using 3H-leucine. Marine Microbial Food Webs 6:107-114.) Leucine Incorporation Measurement Samples were warmed to room temperture and spun for 10 minutes in a bench-top centrifuge at top speed. The supernatant was removed by vacuum aspiration, taking care not to disturb the pellet. The pellet was then resuspended with 1.5ml of 5% TCA using a vortex mixer, and the centrifugation and aspiration step was repeated to rinse the precipitate. 1.5ml of biodegradable scintillation fluid was then added directly into the tube and the suspension was mixed by vortexing. Radioactivity in each tube was measured by liquid scintillation counting (LSC), and disintegrations per minute were calculated from counts per minute by the scintillation counter software based on calculated count efficiency for the samples.

LTER_2005,EML,00016-metadata.xml,Related Resource Citation,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project James T. Hollibaugh principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

One plots each is in tabonuco forest (350 m elevation), colorado forest (650 m) and cloud forest (1000 m). The first records were made shortly before Hurricane Hugo, in 1989. Post hurricane measurements have been made five time to six time in each plot, the most recent been in 1998 for all plots. The results show the damage to forest structure wreaked bye Hurricane Hugo, steady recovery of forest structure after Hugo, minor damage by Hurricane Hortense in 1996, and resumption of recovery after Hortense. Maximum canopy height and the vertical distribution of vegetation in the forests are returning to pre-hurricane Hugo values.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00017-metadata.xml,Spatial Extent,"The Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) covers 11,231 hectares and reaches 1079 m above sea level. It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.-65.92-65.718.3518.23201060meter",/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"/eml:eml/*/coverage/geographicCoverage"

The presence or absence of vegetation in height intervals above ground at points in the plots is recorded approximately every two years. We can then construct a three dimensional map of canopy surface and two- dimensional diagrams of vegetation cover along the vertical profile.

LTER_2005,EML,00018-metadata.xml,Process Step,"YSI 6200 data sondes were deployed vertically in a pool deep enough to contain water during dry conditions. The sonde was deployed in a PVC tube, which was attached to ree-bar driven into the stream bed. The PVC tube had holes drilled to allow adequate water circulation. Dissolved oxygen measurements are of good quality because detritus did not accumulate in the bottom of the pool (unlike our suburban site). The PVC tube was surveyed upon original deployment in 2001 and resurveyed in 2002 to ensure that elevation did not change during winter ice period. No change was detected. No evidence of change has been noted through 2006 based on discharge measurements. See discussion below for development of the discharge-stage relationship. Recalibration of oxygen, pH, conducitivty and depth was performed roughly every 4-6 weeks. Instrument drift during deployment periods was not significant. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH LOCATION COORDINATES: In addition to the decimal degree coordinates given above, locations are also given here in Massachusetts State Plane coordinates. The stream is called Cart Cr. and is located in Newbury MA. Some residential area is present. (~ 10% of the basin). In addition, I-95 passes through the center of the catchment, resulting in roughly 8% impervious surface area STATION STATE X STATE Y YSI-CC 247680 946790 NOTES AND COMMENTS: Velocity measurements were made using a Marsh McBirney current meter. Discharge estimates in Cart Cr. are based on a power rating curve that contains measurements up to a depth of 0.8 meters, as standardized to depth measured with a HOBO datalogger (Column = HOBO_Depth), which is above bankfull stage. Rating curve has been standardized to HOBO_Depth to allow application of a single rating curve across years. Rating curve has an R2 of 0.96 using 32 measurements between 2001 and 2007. All files in this series (2001-2006) are currently standardized to HOBO_depth. This file includes a column called OLD-Discharge, which uses an earlier rating curve with fewer points, a smaller range of depth. This is maintained for comparison with the new and improved rating curve. The column Depth_Device is included when combining files from several years, over which several different devices were used to calculate depth. HOBO_Depth is the depth that is standardized across all measurement devices so that a single rating curve can be applied. CALCULATIONS: Discharge rating curve : Discharge (l/s) = 731.91 (depth) ^ 5.5172 where depth is HOBO_Depth OLD RATING CURVE ( prior to Sept 2007 revision): Discharge measurements in Cart Creek are based on an exponential rating curve that contains measurements up to a depth of 0.475m (Using the column YSI_Depth). Flows above this amount are estimated using a linear extrapolation using the six measurements with the highest flow. Thus flows determined from levels greater than 0.475m are approximate (0 % of the readings in 2001 deployment period). Rating curve below 0.475m is based on an exponential relationship with an R2 = 0.99. Measurements are based on 17 measurements taken between 2001 and 2003. OLD CALCULATIONS (NO LONGER USED): When stage in Cart Cr. is less than 0.475m : Discharge (l/s) = 0.2481 * 2.71828 ^ (12.389 * depth) When stage in Cart Cr. is greater than 0.475m : Discharge (l/s) = 629.7 * depth – 212.8 where depth = YSI_Depth",/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"/eml:eml/*/methods"

In addition, I-95 passes through the center of the catchment, resulting in roughly 8% impervious surface area STATION STATE X STATE Y YSI-CC 247680 946790 NOTES AND COMMENTS: Velocity measurements were made using a Marsh McBirney current meter. Discharge estimates in Cart Cr. are based on a power rating curve that contains measurements up to a depth of 0.8 meters, as standardized to depth measured with a HOBO datalogger (Column = HOBO_Depth), which is above bankfull stage. Rating curve has been standardized to HOBO_Depth to allow application of a single rating curve across years. Rating curve has an R2 of 0.96 using 32 measurements between 2001 and 2007. All files in this series (2001-2006) are currently standardized to HOBO_depth. This file includes a column called OLD-Discharge, which uses an earlier rating curve with fewer points, a smaller range of depth. This is maintained for comparison with the new and improved rating curve. The column Depth_Device is included when combining files from several years, over which several different devices were used to calculate depth. HOBO_Depth is the depth that is standardized across all measurement devices so that a single rating curve can be applied. CALCULATIONS: Discharge rating curve : Discharge (l/s) = 731.91 (depth) ^ 5.5172 where depth is HOBO_Depth OLD RATING CURVE ( prior to Sept 2007 revision): Discharge measurements in Cart Creek are based on an exponential rating curve that contains measurements up to a depth of 0.475m (Using the column YSI_Depth). Flows above this amount are estimated using a linear extrapolation using the six measurements with the highest flow. Thus flows determined from levels greater than 0.475m are approximate (0 % of the readings in 2001 deployment period). Rating curve below 0.475m is based on an exponential relationship with an R2 = 0.99. Measurements are based on 17 measurements taken between 2001 and 2003. OLD CALCULATIONS (NO LONGER USED): When stage in Cart Cr. is less than 0.475m : Discharge (l/s) = 0.2481 * 2.71828 ^ (12.389 * depth) When stage in Cart Cr. is greater than 0.475m : Discharge (l/s) = 629.7 * depth – 212.8 where depth = YSI_Depth",/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"/eml:eml/*/methods"

Data records were parsed from the delimited ASCII file to create a tabular data set using the import filter 'parse_usgs' in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (http://gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu/lter/research/tools/data_toolbox.htm). Data set metadata were imported from a pre-defined metadata template for the station, and data values were validated and quality checked based on attribute metadata and quality control limit check and sanity check parameters defined in the template. Data Processing Imported data were processed using data management and statistical functions in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB. Missing values of daily mean discharge were estimated by cubic spline interpolation to fill in data gaps of five or fewer consecutive days. Annual summary statistics were then calculated by aggregating values based on year. Attribute metadata were automatically generated for each derived statistical parameter. 1932-01-01 2004-12-31 GCE Study Site ALT-BASIN -- Altamaha River basin, Georgia, USA.

LTER_2005,EML,00019-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,"Data Acquisition Daily summary streamflow data were obtained from the United States Geological Survey for streamflow gauging station USGS 02226000 on the Altamaha River near Doctortown, Georgia (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/). Data records were parsed from the delimited ASCII file to create a tabular data set using the import filter 'parse_usgs' in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (http://gce-lter.marsci.uga.edu/lter/research/tools/data_toolbox.htm). Data set metadata were imported from a pre-defined metadata template for the station, and data values were validated and quality checked based on attribute metadata and quality control limit check and sanity check parameters defined in the template. Data Processing Imported data were processed using data management and statistical functions in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB. Missing values of daily mean discharge were estimated by cubic spline interpolation to fill in data gaps of five or fewer consecutive days. Annual summary statistics were then calculated by aggregating values based on year. Attribute metadata were automatically generated for each derived statistical parameter. 1932-01-01 2004-12-31 GCE Study Site ALT-BASIN -- Altamaha River basin, Georgia, USA. Upper Altamaha River watershed basin, encompassing the drainages of the Oconee, Ohoopee, Ocmulgee and Little Ocmulgee Rivers. -84.438334 -81.506075 34.385550 31.315563 Statistical Analysis Real-time water level data were collected by the United States Geological Survey and processed to calculate river discharge. Daily-averaged discharge data were then acquired from the U.S.G.S. web site (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) and statistically analyzed to produce annual discharge summaries.

LTER_2005,EML,00019-metadata.xml,Related Resource Citation,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project James T. Hollibaugh principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

The normal sampling interval is weekly, with more frequent samples taken at times of increased discharge. At low flow summer (drought) conditions, samples may be taken with a clean polyethylene syringe, from undisturbed standing pools in the stream channel.Daily export values (in g/ha-mo) are derived by multiplying daily streamflow amounts (in mm) for watershed 1, by the concentration of solutes (in mg/L) in the WS-1 sample taken on that day. For periods between samples, the average chemistry of the previous and next discrete sample is used for a daily concentration value.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds.

LTER_2005,EML,00022-metadata.xml,Project Description,"Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (ARC LTER) Program John Hobbie The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7496 jhobbie@mbl.edu Lead PI Gus Shaver The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7496 gshaver@mbl.edu Lead PI Jim Laundre The Ecosystems Center Marine Biological Lab 7 MBL St Woods Hole MA 02543 USA (508) 289 7496 arc_imr@mbl.edu Information Manager The goal of Arctic LTER project is to predict the future ecological characteristics of the site based upon our knowledge of the controls of ecosystem structure and function as exerted by physical setting and geologic factors, climatic factors, biotic factors, and the changes in fluxes of water and materials from land to water. To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Vertical CTD profiles were collected at 3-4km intervals from 0km to 36km during low and high tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure and optical backscatter were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected on the upcast were deleted, and the remaining data were averaged within 0.5m depth bins and interpolated to produce a smooth profile for contouring. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

The data then underwent a quality control process, which included removal of the soaking time period, removal of decreasing pressure during the profile due to ship and wave motion, removal of the upcast information (i.e. data after the instrument has hit bottom), removal of spikes in any of the parameters, application of flow-through time delays for the oxygen (0.5 s) and fluormeter (3.75 s) sensors, calculation of PAR depth to account for the physical separation between the PAR and pressure sensors (~0.75m). The quality control operations were performed using custom Matlab programs developed by D. DiIorio and K. Kang. CTD Profile Bin-averaging After post-processing, a subset of profile parameters (depth, temperature, conductivity, salinity, density, sigma-t, suspended particulates) were averaged over 0.5 m depth bins starting at 0.25m below the surface. The fast sampling of the CTD (8Hz) together with the profile speed (~1m/s) resulted in approximately 5 samples in this average. Linear interpolation was then carried out using custom Matlab programs developed by D. DiIorio and K. Kang to produce estimated values at exact depth increments of 0.5m starting at 1.0m depth below the surface. 2003-09-27 GCE Study Site GCE-SP -- Sapelo River, Georgia, USA.

Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

The PAR measurements at both the surface and at each depth were taken using flat-faced, 'cosine-corrected' Licor underwater quantum sensors attached to the datasonde 4. Secchi depth was measured using 22-cm disk.Notes: The Hydrolab was calibrated weekly for Oxygen, using the Barometer in the Surveyor 4.

The in vivo fluorescence measurements were taken using a Turner designs SCUFAÂ® (Self-Contained Underwater Fluorescence Apparatus) attached to the Hydrolab datasonde 4. The PAR measurements at both the surface and at each depth were taken using flat-faced, 'cosine-corrected' Licor underwater quantum sensors attached to the datasonde 4. Secchi depth was measured using 22-cm disk.Notes: The Hydrolab was calibrated weekly for Oxygen, using the Barometer in the Surveyor 4.

LTER_2005,EML,00036-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Soil respiration measurements were made using an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA; EGM-4 gas analyzer, PP Systems, Haverhill, MA) with a dynamic soil respiration chamber (SRC-2, PP Systems). Respiration collars (18) were randomly located on three 20 x 20 m sampling grids (separate from WSOC collection) at each site. The respiration collars (10.2 cm diameter schedule 40 polyvinyl chloride) were inserted to a depth of 2.5 cm at least 1 week prior to initial measurements and were left in place for the duration of the experiment. Care was taken to ensure that the collars remained at the same depth throughout the measurement period. All vascular plants were removed from the collars prior to measuring. Measurements were made approximately bi-weekly at each site, from May through September in 2004 (n = 5 or 6). A portable thermometer was used to measure soil temperature at 10 cm below the surface concurrently with soil respiration measured at each collar. Changes in collar-specific air volumes (caused by changes in microtopography and the presence of moss) were measured directly through use of the ideal gas law by injecting 25 cm-3 of 3500 mg m-3 CO2 into the soil respiration chamber and measuring the subsequent dilution of CO2 concentration with the IRGA. All flux values have been adjusted for these collar specific volumes.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00038-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Plant phenology or life-history pattern changes seasonally as plants grow, mature, flower, and produce fruit and seeds. Plant phenology follows seasonal patterns, yet annual variation may occur due to annual differences in the timing of rainfall and ambient temperature shifts. Foliage growth and fruit and seed production are important aspects of plant population dynamics and food resource availability for animals. The purpose of this study is to assess plant phenology patterns across a series of biotic communities that represent an environmental moisture gradient. These communites include: Chihuhuan Desert creosotebush shrubland, Chihuahuan Desert black grama grassland, and blue grama grassland. Plant phenology is recorded for all plant species across 4 replicate 200 m transects at each of the 3 habitat sites. Plant phenology measurements are taken once every month from February through October. The first ten individuals of each plant species encountered along each transect are assessed for life-history status. Data recorded include the status of leaves, flowers and fruit. Leaves are recorded as new, old, brown or absent. Reproductive status is recorded as absent, buds, flowers, fruits or both fruits and flowers. Data from the site P and J were only collected in 2000 and 2001 and are included in this data set.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00038-metadata.xml,Maintenance,"12/2/2008For both 2007 and 2008, individual monthly files were checked for errors and compiled in pc_field/phenology. These were uploaded into navicat. Then all the data was exported and put on line with this updated meta data and EML.2/8/2007Phenology data from 2001-2006 was taken out of flat files and imported into MySQL. Once in the database, I checked for duplicates. These most often happened when a recorder had already taken data for a particular species and accidentally started a new row for data for that species. In these instances, no data was deleted, but the observation numbers were made consecutive. Therefore, they end up with more than 10 observations per web. In no case was this more than 20. The other reason I found duplicates was in years where certain recorders collected separate data for seedlings and adults. In these cases, no data was thrown away and againg the observation number was made consecutive and there also can be up to 20 observations per web for these species. Always in this case the comment 'SEEDLING' was added to the relevant observations. I also checked every plant code against the USDA Plants database online at http://plants.usda.gov/ All plant codes that have had nomenclature changes were updated. All previously unknown plants that have since been identified were also updated. All unknown plants that will never be identified were dropped from the database. All typos were corrected.

LTER_2005,EML,00038-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Locating the Transects:Phenological conditions are recorded along four permanently marked 200 m x 2 m wide transects at each of the core study sites. The transects are located within four of the five rodent trapping webs. All five transects were originally measured, but in 2003 the least diverse transect at each site was dropped. Each web consists of twelve 100 m transects radiating as spokes from a central rebar stake marked #145. As measured from the center stake, the first four stakes within a ray are positioned at 5 m intervals and the remaining eight at 10 m intervals along a given transect. Plant phenology is recorded along two of these 100 m transects, the transect that extends due north from the central stake and the transect that extends due south from the central stake. The stakes that extend due north are marked 1-12 where stake #1 is closest to the center stake. The stakes that extend due south are marked 73-84 where stake #73 is closest to center. Collecting the Data:Each transect is sampled by one technician. Measurements are started from the northern (stake #12) end of each transect. The technician walks in a straight line from one stake to the next surveying a 1 m wide area on each side of the line until the opposite end of the transect is reached. As a transect is walked, phenological conditions are recorded for each species that occurs along the transect. The phenological condition of the first 10 individuals of each species is recorded. After the conditions of ten individuals have been recorded no more observations are made for that particular species even though more may be encountered. Conversely, for rare species only a few individuals may be encountered so there will be less than 10 observations.Because measurements are taken on separate individuals, it is important to note that many plants have clonal growth forms. This can be seen in some grasses that occur as a clump of overlapping vegetation. In this case each clump is treated as a single individual. This is also true for some cactus and yucca species that appear as a cluster of many individual heads.Determining Phenological Conditions:1. New green foliage (N)This category refers to a plant that is producing new vegetative tissue. The production of new vegetative tissue can be characterized in several ways depending on the species. In many herbaceous plants, new vegetative growth will be indicated by the presence of immature leaves or stems. In herbaceous plants this growth generally appears near the tips of shoots and also at axillary buds.For species that have a rosette growth form (yucca, some herbaceous plants), the center of the rosette is examined for the presence of immature leaves.In cacti, the spines are modified leaves and do not readily indicate new vegetative growth so cacti are examined for production of new stems. For example, in Opuntia spp., the presence of a new stem/pad represents new green foliage as each stem-joint represents a season's growth. Cacti that exhibit a cylindrical growth form are more difficult to classify. Cacti with tuberculate stems (Mammilaria spp.) are examined for new tubercules which can often be seen in the center of the head. More problematic are the ribbed cacti where the growth of one season is continuous with that of the preceding season.  While these species may be producing new growth it is extremely difficult to identify and thus they are usually categorized as old green foliage.2. Old green foliage (O)This category refers to a plant that is not producing new vegetative tissue but exhibits only mature green foliage.  3. Brown leaves (B)This category refers to a plant that has only brown leaves and is used to indicate a period of senescence or decline.  4. No leaves (Z)This category is similar to the above category.  It is meant to capture a period of senescence or decline and refers to a plant that has subsequently dropped its leaves. It only applies to growth forms that drop their leaves during a period of dormancy or senescence. This category is not used for plants such as Ephedra spp. that normally do not have leaves.Determining Phenological Conditions:1. New flowers (FL)This category refers to the presence of flowers at anthesis (open flowers). For many species the petals are large and showy making this condition easy to identify. In species with small or reduced flowers, this condition represents the presence of key reproductive structures such as stamens and/or carpels.   2. New fruit (FR)This category refers to the presence of a ripened ovary that contains seed. Open fruits that do not contain seed are not categorized as fruiting.  Open fruits that do contain seed belong in this category.               3. Fruits and Flowers (FF)This category indicates that both fruit and flowers are present.4. No Fruits or Flowers (Z)This category indicates that neither fruits or flowers are present.5. Flower buds (B)This category indicates that only closed flower buds are present.QAQC: Each month, the data is QAQCd for typos and incorrect plant codes. To do this in Excel, place the cursor in the first cell of the actual data, not the headings. Go to Data/Filter and select auto filter. Each list formed should fit the parameters listed above. The plant list and the unknown plant list should be updated regularly. Check all errors against the paper data. Be sure that the numbers at the end of the kartez codes are correct. In most cases, all errors can be fixed at this time.At the end of every year, compile all the data into one file for the year. Check to make sure no data is missing or duplicated. Also, each year, all the previous years data should be updated using the unknown plant list to replace former unknowns with their proper kartez code. At this point all compiled, yearly data sets should be re-archived, replacing the old data sets. Meta data should be maintained with every data set.Recording the Data:For each transect, the following is recorded:   1.

The page number (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)The species code for all the species occurring along the transect is recorded. Then the phenological conditions of the individual plants in the area are recorded in the Fol and Flw columns of the data sheet. The Fol column is for status codes reflecting the condition of a plant's foliage and the Flw column is for codes reflecting the reproductive status of the plant. The status codes are as follows:Foliage codes:N = new green foliageO = old green foliage onlyB = brown leaves onlyZ = no leavesReproductive codes:FL = new flowerFR = new fruitsFF = new fruits and flowersZ = no fruits or flowersB  = Only buds presentBFL = Buds and flowersBFR = Buds and fruits The phenology data is taken with paper and pencil.

Cacti that exhibit a cylindrical growth form are more difficult to classify. Cacti with tuberculate stems (Mammilaria spp.) are examined for new tubercules which can often be seen in the center of the head. More problematic are the ribbed cacti where the growth of one season is continuous with that of the preceding season.  While these species may be producing new growth it is extremely difficult to identify and thus they are usually categorized as old green foliage.2. Old green foliage (O)This category refers to a plant that is not producing new vegetative tissue but exhibits only mature green foliage.  3. Brown leaves (B)This category refers to a plant that has only brown leaves and is used to indicate a period of senescence or decline.  4. No leaves (Z)This category is similar to the above category.  It is meant to capture a period of senescence or decline and refers to a plant that has subsequently dropped its leaves. It only applies to growth forms that drop their leaves during a period of dormancy or senescence. This category is not used for plants such as Ephedra spp. that normally do not have leaves.Determining Phenological Conditions:1. New flowers (FL)This category refers to the presence of flowers at anthesis (open flowers). For many species the petals are large and showy making this condition easy to identify. In species with small or reduced flowers, this condition represents the presence of key reproductive structures such as stamens and/or carpels.   2. New fruit (FR)This category refers to the presence of a ripened ovary that contains seed. Open fruits that do not contain seed are not categorized as fruiting.  Open fruits that do contain seed belong in this category.               3. Fruits and Flowers (FF)This category indicates that both fruit and flowers are present.4. No Fruits or Flowers (Z)This category indicates that neither fruits or flowers are present.5. Flower buds (B)This category indicates that only closed flower buds are present.QAQC: Each month, the data is QAQCd for typos and incorrect plant codes. To do this in Excel, place the cursor in the first cell of the actual data, not the headings. Go to Data/Filter and select auto filter. Each list formed should fit the parameters listed above. The plant list and the unknown plant list should be updated regularly. Check all errors against the paper data. Be sure that the numbers at the end of the kartez codes are correct. In most cases, all errors can be fixed at this time.At the end of every year, compile all the data into one file for the year. Check to make sure no data is missing or duplicated. Also, each year, all the previous years data should be updated using the unknown plant list to replace former unknowns with their proper kartez code. At this point all compiled, yearly data sets should be re-archived, replacing the old data sets. Meta data should be maintained with every data set.Recording the Data:For each transect, the following is recorded:   1. Recorder- Recorder's initials and also the initials of anyone helping take measurements on that particular transect.  2. The date (month, day, year)  3. The site (B, G, C, J, P)B = Blue grama grasslandG = Five-Points grasslandC = Five-Points creosoteJ = Juniper SavannaP = Pinon-Juniper woodland 4. The web (1,2,3,4,5) 5. The page number (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)The species code for all the species occurring along the transect is recorded. Then the phenological conditions of the individual plants in the area are recorded in the Fol and Flw columns of the data sheet. The Fol column is for status codes reflecting the condition of a plant's foliage and the Flw column is for codes reflecting the reproductive status of the plant. The status codes are as follows:Foliage codes:N = new green foliageO = old green foliage onlyB = brown leaves onlyZ = no leavesReproductive codes:FL = new flowerFR = new fruitsFF = new fruits and flowersZ = no fruits or flowersB  = Only buds presentBFL = Buds and flowersBFR = Buds and fruits The phenology data is taken with paper and pencil.

Each Spring the pipe was reinstalled in approximately the same vertical space with the intention of relating the relative water level measurements to a datum such as NAVD88.",/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"/eml:eml/*/methods"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565.

Additional information for the documentation section, as well as the header and data sections were supplied by Nel Caine on 12 February 1993. Data were compiled in January 1993 by Nel Caine from earlier files for individual years.[RCI, 12 February 1993] This file was put under sccs control on 30 March 1993. See the appropriate history file for additional log information.[RCI 30 March 1993] Data for 1982-1991 were reformatted in order to be consistent with post-1991 data formats on 2 May 1994. The variables, comments, and header sections were modified accordingly.[RCI 2 May 1994] Data for 1993 were appended to the data section on 4 May 1994.[RCI 4 May 1994] Comments were added to the documentation section with regard to late April/early May 1994 repeated analyses on 1993 samples.[RCI 17 May 1994] On 11 July 1994, it was discovered that the spring 1994 conversions from mg NO3/L to ueq NO3/L for 1982-1991 data had been incorrectly done (mg/L values were multiplied by 61.3 instead of 16.39). The 1982-1991 data were extracted from this file, a script to correct the error was run on the extracted data, and the corrected data were used to replace the erroneous data on 12 July 1994. [RCI 12 July 1994] The 1992, as well as 2 records from 1993, data were provided by Chris Seibold on 16 November 1994. These data were processed and inserted into the data section on 17 November 1994.[RCI 17 November 1994] All data for 920709 were converted to missing because all values were deemed to be too low (presumably because the sample was inadvertently diluted) by Mark Williams and Nel Caine.[RCI 30 January 1995] Data for 1994 were appended to the data section on 12 February 1996.

University of Colorado Long-Term Ecological Research Data Report 89/1. 29 pp. Data for 1982-1991 were originally provided by Nel Caine as space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet and the later data sets were provided by the Kiowa Lab manager in space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet. The 2 formats differed in terms of units, number of columns, and column order. The times at which samples were collected were not provided in the data for 1982-1991, although some of this information could be retrieved from the original field notebooks of Nel Caine. Similarly, charge balances were not provided with the earlier data but could be calculated from the other data. The charge balance was calculated as (cation sum - anion sum)/(cation sum + anion sum). Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero. A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that the Cl concentration for 911226 'seems unusually low.' The following 2 records were included in the file containing the 1992 data and represent redetermination of 2 1991 samples. A portion or all of these data may or may not ultimately be used to replace the original determinations.

The analyses were repeated in late April/early May 1994 and provided an ANC of 47.70 uS/cm and a Cl concentration of 69.92 ueq/L. A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that 'Cl is high here' and 'contaminated?' for the 931111 sample. The analysis was repeated in late April/early May 1994 and provided a Cl concentration of 27.81 ueq/L. Total and dissolved N and P were measured beginning in 1994. 'Empty' columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format. Particulate, inorganic, and dissolved organic N and P as well as PO4--- were measured beginning in 1996. Some of these parameters had been measured on several of the 1995 samples, so all the data for 1995 were reprocessed to include these measurements and 'empty' columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format. The the sample bottles for the first records for 941013, 941027, 941124, 941222, and 941229 were soaked in 10% HCL solution, while the sample bottles for the second records for these dates were soaked in Deionized water. A note on the laboratory print out indicated that the sample for the first record for 941124 was contaminated with K+ and CL-. A note on the laboratory print out corresponding to the 960306 record said 'High concentrations in this sample are probably good. Very low flow volume with ground water'. The sampling site is at 3250 m elevation and represents a drainage area of 709.7 ha. Dissolved organic C was measured starting in 1998. Total organic C and particulate organic C were measured starting in 2002. Delta 18O was measured starting in 1998. Units were originally reported as 'ppm', but the correct units are 'per mill' as confirmed by Chris Seibold (17 November 2011). Delta deuterium, the standard deviations of delta 18O and delta deuterium values, and deuterium excess were measured starting in 2007. The missing value indicator is one of the following codes: DNS=Data Not Submitted , EQCL=Exceeds Quality Control Limits , N/A=Not Applicable , NP=Not Performed , NSS=No Sample Submitted , NV=Not Valid , QNS=Quantity Not Sufficient , Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero prior to 2007 and 'u' subsequently. Measurement detection limits and precision as of March, 2011: Measurement detection limits and precision table Note: Columns for acidity, alkalinity, tritium, total organic C, and particulate organic C are present in the data set for consistency with other stream water chemistry data sets.

Similarly, charge balances were not provided with the earlier data but could be calculated from the other data. The charge balance was calculated as (cation sum - anion sum)/(cation sum + anion sum). Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero. A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that the Cl concentration for 911226 'seems unusually low.' The following 2 records were included in the file containing the 1992 data and represent redetermination of 2 1991 samples. A portion or all of these data may or may not ultimately be used to replace the original determinations. Column formats are identical to those described in the header section below: ALBION,911031,1220,6.99,27.00,127.99,0.10,,190.62,19.74,37.84,8.95,5.75,17.22,91.82,35.68,257.26,242.78,0.03 ALBION,911226,1415,7.33,47.20,284.49,0.05,,322.60,54.79,77.43,11.76,6.80,16.93,121.07,115.08,466.63,429.29,0.04 A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that the 'ANC seems very low and Cl extremely low' for the 930805 sample. The analyses were repeated in late April/early May 1994 and provided an ANC of 47.70 uS/cm and a Cl concentration of 69.92 ueq/L. A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold indicated that 'Cl is high here' and 'contaminated?' for the 931111 sample. The analysis was repeated in late April/early May 1994 and provided a Cl concentration of 27.81 ueq/L. Total and dissolved N and P were measured beginning in 1994. 'Empty' columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format. Particulate, inorganic, and dissolved organic N and P as well as PO4--- were measured beginning in 1996. Some of these parameters had been measured on several of the 1995 samples, so all the data for 1995 were reprocessed to include these measurements and 'empty' columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format. The the sample bottles for the first records for 941013, 941027, 941124, 941222, and 941229 were soaked in 10% HCL solution, while the sample bottles for the second records for these dates were soaked in Deionized water. A note on the laboratory print out indicated that the sample for the first record for 941124 was contaminated with K+ and CL-. A note on the laboratory print out corresponding to the 960306 record said 'High concentrations in this sample are probably good. Very low flow volume with ground water'. The sampling site is at 3250 m elevation and represents a drainage area of 709.7 ha. Dissolved organic C was measured starting in 1998. Total organic C and particulate organic C were measured starting in 2002. Delta 18O was measured starting in 1998. Units were originally reported as 'ppm', but the correct units are 'per mill' as confirmed by Chris Seibold (17 November 2011). Delta deuterium, the standard deviations of delta 18O and delta deuterium values, and deuterium excess were measured starting in 2007. The missing value indicator is one of the following codes: DNS=Data Not Submitted , EQCL=Exceeds Quality Control Limits , N/A=Not Applicable , NP=Not Performed , NSS=No Sample Submitted , NV=Not Valid , QNS=Quantity Not Sufficient , Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero prior to 2007 and 'u' subsequently. Measurement detection limits and precision as of March, 2011: Measurement detection limits and precision table Note: Columns for acidity, alkalinity, tritium, total organic C, and particulate organic C are present in the data set for consistency with other stream water chemistry data sets. Measurements for these variables were not performed for this data set.",/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"/eml:eml/*/methods"

The remains of two lodges were observed, but they were less than 20 cm in height, had vegetation growing out of them, and showed no sign of activity, so they were not surveyed.

This sub-catchment (35 ha area) of the Mirror Lake watershed contains 3 seasonal homes and one unpaved (un-salted in winter) road. Numerous studies have been conducted on Mirror Lake since the mid-1960s, including extensive chemical, biological, and paleoecological research which are described in detail in the book: An Ecosystem Approach to Aquatic Ecology (Likens, 1985).SAMPLING DESIGNSamples are collected in acid-washed, deionized water-rinsed, polyethylene bottles. The normal sampling interval is weekly, with more frequent samples taken at times of increased discharge.DATA DESCRIPTIONConcentrations (mg/L) in weekly streamwater samples. Base cation data are available since 1967: pH since 1968. Ammonium, anions, and dissolved silica have been measured routinely since 1970, and phosphate was determined routinely first in 1972, although some data are available prior to these dates for each solute.Mirror Lake: its past, present and future?G.E.Likens1972englishAppalachia39223-41An Ecosystem Approach to Aquatic Ecology: Mirror Lake and its Environmentlikens1985Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.516 pp.Chemistry of precipitation, streamwater, and lakewater from the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study: a record of sampling protocols and analytical proceduresD.C.BusolikensJ.S.Eaton2000Gen.

This sub-catchment (35 ha area) of the Mirror Lake watershed contains 3 seasonal homes and one unpaved (un-salted in winter) road. Numerous studies have been conducted on Mirror Lake since the mid-1960s, including extensive chemical, biological, and paleoecological research which are described in detail in the book: An Ecosystem Approach to Aquatic Ecology (Likens, 1985).SAMPLING DESIGNSamples are collected in acid-washed, deionized water-rinsed, polyethylene bottles. The normal sampling interval is weekly, with more frequent samples taken at times of increased discharge.DATA DESCRIPTIONConcentrations (mg/L) in weekly streamwater samples. Base cation data are available since 1967: pH since 1968. Ammonium, anions, and dissolved silica have been measured routinely since 1970, and phosphate was determined routinely first in 1972, although some data are available prior to these dates for each solute.Mirror Lake: its past, present and future?G.E.Likens1972englishAppalachia39223-41An Ecosystem Approach to Aquatic Ecology: Mirror Lake and its Environmentlikens1985Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.516 pp.Chemistry of precipitation, streamwater, and lakewater from the Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study: a record of sampling protocols and analytical proceduresD.C.BusolikensJ.S.Eaton2000Gen.

LTER_2005,EML,00051-metadata.xml,Process Step,"The LTER acidic tussock site was set up in 1989. The experimental design is four blocks of 5 x 20 meters plots with randomly assigned treatments within each block. Treatments include control (CT), amended with 10 g per square meter of Nitrogen and 5 g per square meter of phosphorus (NP), simple warming with plastic covered greenhouses (GH), simple warming amended with 10 and 5 g per square meter of nitrogen and phosphorus (GHNP) and 50% shade house with and without 10 and 5 g per square meter of nitrogen and phosphorus added (SH and SHNP). Exclosure plots were setup in July 1996 on extra 5 x 20 meters plots within the four-block design of the 1989 LTER acidic tussock experimental plots. On each plot a 5x10 meter section was fenced with large mesh (4-inch square mesh) and within this fence a 5x5-meter plot was fenced with a small mesh (1/2-inch square mesh). In each block two fenced plots were setup: a plot with no fertilizer and a plot with annual fertilization (NP) treatments of 10 g/m2 Nitrogen (as NH4NO3) and 5 g/m2 Phosphorous (as triple superphosphate). In this biomass harvest only the control, 1989 NP (NP13), GH, GHNP, control small mesh (EX), NP unfenced (NP6), and NP small mesh (EXNP) treatments were sampled. Calculations: Units; Tissue mass data are expressed in g/quadrat (400 cm2). Multiply by 25 to get g/m2. Reference Citations: Shaver, G. R. and F. S. Chapin, III. 1991. Production/biomass relationships and element cycling in contrasting arctic vegetation types. Ecological Monographs 61:1-31. Sampling Description. Biomass quadrats, size 20x20 cm, were taken from Toolik tussock site. Five quadrats were taken from each of four blocks. All aboveground biomass was clipped in 20x20 cm quadrats. Five quadrats were randomly located along line transects in each of four replicate blocks in each treatment. Aboveground biomass is considered 'within' the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Quadrats were sorted within 24 hours into species and then into tissue type. Depending on the harvest, tissue types can be broad categories, i.e. above and below, or more detailed, i.e. inflorescences, new growth, old growth, etc. Leaf area was measured with a LiCor LI-3000A area meter. The samples were dried at 60 degrees C in a drying oven and after several days weighed to nearest milligram. Samples are then returned to Woods Hole for nutrient analysis. Details are given in Shaver and Chapin (Ecological Monographs, 61(1), 1991, pg. 1-31). Protocol pers-1",/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"/eml:eml/*/methods"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

LTER_2005,EML,00060-metadata.xml,Process Step,"General: There are three on-going plot-level fertilization sites. The first (LTE-MP-LPA) is in the S. alterniflora-dominated low marsh at Law's Point between the Rowley River and West Creek. The second (LTE-MP-LPP) is in the S. patens-dominated high marsh at Law's Point between the Rowley River and West Creek. The third (LTE-MP-ORT) is in a Typha-dominated brackish water marsh on an upstream tributary of the Parker River. SET sampling at the LTE-MP-ORT)was discontinued after May 2008. At each site a system of boardwalks was built to incorporate 12 experimental plots (1m2 each). There are 4 treatments (three reps each) within the boardwalk structure. The 4 treatments are Control, N-fertilized, P-fertilized, N+P fertilized. Additionally, at each site there are 3 control plots and 3 N+P fertilization plots external to the boardwalk structure. These external plots contain porewater samplers, and, in some cases, biomass census plots. In May 2006 the control porewater plots and control census plots at all three sites were moved because of potential contamination from fertilized plots. Fertilizer is buried at several locations within each plot, approximately monthly, from May-Sept. From 1999-2001 the annual fertilization rate was 30 molN/m2/y and 15 mol P/m2/y. From 2002 to present fertilization rate is 7.5 mol N/m2/y and/or 3.75 mol P/m2/y. N fertilizer was NH4NO3 through 2008, and currently is nitrate/urea/sulfate (34-0-0). P fertilizer is P2O5 (0-44-0). Sampling Description: Triplicate original-style SET benchmark posts were installed between fertilized and control plots in 1999 at LTE-MP-LPA and 2000 at LTE-MP-LPP and LTE-MP-ORT. Each SET consists of a permanently-installed post and a removable arm. The arm has a vertical and a horizontal component. The vertical component fits into the SET benchmark post; the horizontal component reaches out over an experimental subplot and has a square plate at the end through which 9 pins are lowered. Each SET benchmark post is positioned such that 27 elevation readings can be taken in a fertilized plot (9 readings in each of 3 subplots) and 27 elevation readings can be taken in a control plot (9 readings in each of 3 subplots). Plots are numbered; subplots are identified as L, C, or R for left, center and right, when facing the plot (back to the SET post). To measure pin heights, the SET arm is locked in place over each subplot and the plate at the end of the arm is leveled. The 9 brass pins are then lowered to touch the sediment surface and held in place with a clip. Pin heights are measured from the top of the nut on the plate to the top of the pin, and read into a digital recorder. The recordings are transcribed into one master SET pin height data set. SET readings occur approximately monthly, from May-October at LTE-MP-LPA and LTE-MP-LPP, and in May and October only at LTE-MP-ORT. Sampling at the ORT SET was discontinued in 2008. The horizontal portion of the removable part of the PIE LTER SET can be correctly installed and leveled in several positions: i.e. the arm can be extended all the way forward, all the way back, and anywhere in between. All SET measurements are made with the arm all the way back, i.e. with the plate being as close to the SET post as possible and the SET arm being as short as possible. The SET was manufactured by Nolan’s Machine Shop in Lafayette LA; 337-235-5261. Replacement pins or collars can be purchased from Nolan’s. Stainless steel parts (roll pins etc) come from McMaster-Carr. Measuring pins are held in place with badge clips, available at office supply stores. Data Processing: Data are transcribed from a digital recorder to an Excel spreadsheet. Change in marsh elevation is determined by subtracting pin height at time X from the mean pin height for the subplot at time 0. SAS programs are used to determine treatment means and standard error for each month.

Five sites were established to monitor vegetation recovery following fire, two in a lightly-burned area that had live trees that survived the fire (L1 and L2), and three in more severely-burned areas where all the trees were killed (H1, H2, H3; Viereck and Dyrness, 1979). The pre-fire stands were composed almost entirely of black spruce. The experimental burns in 1978 were located along the southwest slopes of Wickersham Dome near the ridgetop (elevation 490-550 m). There were 7 experimental burns (Ex01-Ex07), each approximately 2 ha in size. The burns were ignited on different days in July and August of 1978, and differed in the level of burn severity (Dyrness and Norum, 1983). Pre-fire vegetation in these plots was largely black spruce, but some sites had a small component of trembling aspen or paper birch. Methods Post-fire vegetation changes at the Wickersham sites were monitored in a grid of 20 sample points laid out at 10-m intervals along 4-5 parallel transects at each site (Table 1). Tree seedling counts and height measurements at each sample point were made in circular, 4 m2 (114 cm radius) plots marked with a metal stake in the centerpoint. Measurements in the 1971 wildfire were made yearly during the first 10 years after fire, and then again 15 (1986) and 31 (2002) years after fire. The vegetation plots in the seven 1978 experimental burns were measured annually during the first three years after fire, and then were not measured again until 2002, 24 years after fire.

Species abundance was determined by hand-collecting all the infaunal and epifaunal molluscs from within quadrats of known area in mid-marsh and creekbank zones (n = 4 quadrats per zone) at all sites. The molluscs were returned to the lab, fixed in fomalin, transferred to and preserved in ethanol, counted and measured (size data is reported separately). The counts were converted to number per square meter. Gastropod species are listed first, followed by bivalve species. Size distribution data for these collections may be found in the GCE-LTER data set INV-GCEM-0412b2.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00062-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Mollusc Collection A quadrat device, constructed of treated, 1' X 3/4' slats, drilled and joined with bolts and wing nuts, was designed to enclose selectable areas of 0.0625, 0.25 or 0.5 m^2. The quadrat size used for each sample may have varied between plots, zones, and sites and was dependent on apparent density of molluscs (particularly Littoraria) in the immediate area. In high density areas, smaller quadrats were used and vice versa. Quadrat selection was guided by the need to balance accuracy of abundance estimates, prevention of excessive removal of fauna and ensurance that field sampling was kept to a reasonable amount of time. The quadrat was placed around the bases of the plants in the selected sampling area. Snails are collected first, from the standing plants. Collection started at the tops of the plants and proceeded downward to the marsh surface. Particular attention was given to enrolled, scenescing leaves, when present, as new recruits and smaller species were often concentrated there. After the plants had been inspected, the marsh surface was examined for snails and signs of infaunal bivalves. After all epifaunal molluscs were removed, the infaunal bivalves were dug from the sediment. This often required feeling (centimeter by centimeter) along the marsh surface and probing down inside large crab holes to make sure all individuals were collected. All molluscs were placed in pre-labeled plastic bags and transported back to the lab. The molluscs were washed free of sediment over a sieve (< 500 micron-mesh), fixed with 10% formalin and ultimately transferred to and preserved in 70% ethanol. Density Estimation Individuals were identified to the lowest practicable taxonomic unit and the number of individuals of each species was determined. The identity of small individuals was confirmed with a stereomicroscope. Per meter square density for each species was determined by dividing total count data for a sample by the quadrat size used for the sample. Stereomicroscope; manufacturer: Leica (model: MZ 7.5) Stereomicroscope; manufacturer: Wild (model: M5) RTK-GPS Survey of Permanent Plot Locations A survey was performed in April 2010 to measure the precise geographic locations and elevations of long-term plant plots at GCE-LTER marsh study sites 1-10. The survey was performed using a Trimble R6 real-time kinematic GPS sytem with Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) support. The base receiver was placed on a permanent cement base installed near each field site, connected to GLONASS satellite services via mobile 3G Internet connection, and allowed to establish a stable benchmark positional fix prior to the survey. A portable wireless rover unit was then used to collect and log horizontal position and vertical elevation data on the ground at the center of each plot. Data were then corrected and analyzed using Trimble Geomatics Office software to determine latitude, longitude and elevation, and plant plot locations were then registered in the GCE-LTER geographic database. Location, Longitude and Latitude columns were then added to the data table based on matching site, marsh zone and plot number of each record to the corresponding plot identifier in the geographic database. For plots that were lost due to catastrophic disturbance prior to 2010 and replaced, the measured location of the the replacement plots were used to provide estimated positional information for the legacy plots, and the estimated values were flagged and the level of uncertainty was described based on the number of times the plot was replaced prior to RTK-GPS survey.

Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island. This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock). -81.295506 -81.258908 31.497026 31.462320 Mollusc Abundance Survey Samples were taken within 3 meters of the GCE permanent monitoring plots, which were established in the marsh areas at each GCE sampling site in October, 2000. Each site was divided into two nominal zones -- creekbank and mid-marsh -- and eight plots were randomly located in each zone and marked with stakes. This study represents a regular component of the population monitoring program of the GCE-LTER. It was designed to document abundance and spatial distribution of common infaunal and epifaunal molluscs and track their changes over time at each of the ten intertidal marsh monitoring sites within the GCE-LTER domain. All molluscs within randomly placed, small quadrats at four plots in the mid and creekbank marshes at each of the permanent monitoring sites were collected by hand. This design resulted in four replicate samples per zone (n = 4) at each site (n = 8 per site). Collections were made by different teams of trained individuals (staff and volunteers). Molluscs were returned to the lab, preserved and enumerated. For each sample, an area of marsh was selected that was similar in gross appearance and near to (within 3 m of) a GCE permanent monitoring plot. The permanent plots were not used so as to avoid damaging the plants within them. Permanent plots 1, 3, 6, and 8 in each zone were chosen to be the anchor plots for selecting actual sample areas. When wrack or other disturbances necessitated the use of alternate plots, these are indicated in the data set and noted as anomalies.

Quadrat selection was guided by the need to balance accuracy of abundance estimates, prevention of excessive removal of fauna and ensurance that field sampling was kept to a reasonable amount of time. The quadrat was placed around the bases of the plants in the selected sampling area. Snails are collected first, from the standing plants. Collection started at the tops of the plants and proceeded downward to the marsh surface. Particular attention was given to enrolled, scenescing leaves, when present, as new recruits and smaller species were often concentrated there. After the plants had been inspected, the marsh surface was examined for snails and signs of infaunal bivalves. After all epifaunal molluscs were removed, the infaunal bivalves were dug from the sediment. This often required feeling (centimeter by centimeter) along the marsh surface and probing down inside large crab holes to make sure all individuals were collected. All molluscs were placed in pre-labeled plastic bags and transported back to the lab. The molluscs were washed free of sediment over a sieve (< 500 micron-mesh), fixed with 10% formalin and ultimately transferred to and preserved in 70% ethanol. Density Estimation Individuals were identified to the lowest practicable taxonomic unit and the number of individuals of each species was determined. The identity of small individuals was confirmed with a stereomicroscope. Per meter square density for each species was determined by dividing total count data for a sample by the quadrat size used for the sample. Stereomicroscope; manufacturer: Leica (model: MZ 7.5) Stereomicroscope; manufacturer: Wild (model: M5) RTK-GPS Survey of Permanent Plot Locations A survey was performed in April 2010 to measure the precise geographic locations and elevations of long-term plant plots at GCE-LTER marsh study sites 1-10. The survey was performed using a Trimble R6 real-time kinematic GPS sytem with Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) support. The base receiver was placed on a permanent cement base installed near each field site, connected to GLONASS satellite services via mobile 3G Internet connection, and allowed to establish a stable benchmark positional fix prior to the survey. A portable wireless rover unit was then used to collect and log horizontal position and vertical elevation data on the ground at the center of each plot. Data were then corrected and analyzed using Trimble Geomatics Office software to determine latitude, longitude and elevation, and plant plot locations were then registered in the GCE-LTER geographic database. Location, Longitude and Latitude columns were then added to the data table based on matching site, marsh zone and plot number of each record to the corresponding plot identifier in the geographic database. For plots that were lost due to catastrophic disturbance prior to 2010 and replaced, the measured location of the the replacement plots were used to provide estimated positional information for the legacy plots, and the estimated values were flagged and the level of uncertainty was described based on the number of times the plot was replaced prior to RTK-GPS survey.

Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area. Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge. -81.428481 -81.410732 31.546750 31.533963 GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA. Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like 'Sutherland Bluff', are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater. -81.318961 -81.292844 31.552554 31.533604 GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site. Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island. -81.233249 -81.195661 31.546868 31.515188 GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA. Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland. -81.370752 -81.357256 31.463533 31.448419 GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA. Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound. No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data. -81.354413 -81.327201 31.442538 31.417640 GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse. A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity and genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu) -81.299522 -81.264378 31.394072 31.371003 GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA.

Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site. -81.493498 -81.475900 31.348774 31.334364 GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA. Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings. -81.426272 -81.410634 31.317808 31.304063 GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA. Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings. -81.346730 -81.326495 31.358142 31.339173 GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island. This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock). -81.295506 -81.258908 31.497026 31.462320 Mollusc Abundance Survey Samples were taken within 3 meters of the GCE permanent monitoring plots, which were established in the marsh areas at each GCE sampling site in October, 2000. Each site was divided into two nominal zones -- creekbank and mid-marsh -- and eight plots were randomly located in each zone and marked with stakes. This study represents a regular component of the population monitoring program of the GCE-LTER. It was designed to document abundance and spatial distribution of common infaunal and epifaunal molluscs and track their changes over time at each of the ten intertidal marsh monitoring sites within the GCE-LTER domain. All molluscs within randomly placed, small quadrats at four plots in the mid and creekbank marshes at each of the permanent monitoring sites were collected by hand. This design resulted in four replicate samples per zone (n = 4) at each site (n = 8 per site). Collections were made by different teams of trained individuals (staff and volunteers). Molluscs were returned to the lab, preserved and enumerated. For each sample, an area of marsh was selected that was similar in gross appearance and near to (within 3 m of) a GCE permanent monitoring plot. The permanent plots were not used so as to avoid damaging the plants within them. Permanent plots 1, 3, 6, and 8 in each zone were chosen to be the anchor plots for selecting actual sample areas. When wrack or other disturbances necessitated the use of alternate plots, these are indicated in the data set and noted as anomalies.

Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Automatically-assigned qualifier flags are reviewed graphically and revised or augmented as deemed appropriate by GCE information management staff, based on metadata information from the contributor, values of other measured variables, or statistical tests. Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.",/eml:eml/dataset/dataTable/methods/qualityControl,"//methods/qualityControl"

LTER_2005,EML,00063-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Water samples were collected by Niskin bottle or by hand from just beneath the surface during low tide surveys at or near 10 GCE-LTER sampling sites in September 2002. The incorporation of radiolabelled bicarbonate in response to varying levels of illumination was measured using a photosynthetron apparatus. Photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves constructed from these measurements will be used in conjunction with algal biomass and PAR versus depth measurements to estimate instantaneous gross primary production in the water at each GCE sampling site. This study was part of the GCE-LTER hydrographic monitoring program, and will be repeated quarterly.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00063-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Water Collection Water samples from the R/V Savannah were collected approximately 1 meter below the surface using a niskin bottle. The water sample was then transferred to Brown 1 L Nalgene bottles. Bottles were first rinced once with approximately 100 ml of sample water prior to filling. Surface samples collected from the R/V Salty Dawg and Carolina Skiff were collected by hand approximately 0.5 meters below the surface of the water using a Brown 1 L Nalgene bottle once rinsed with sample water. Operating the Photosynthetron The intensity of photosynthetically-available radation (PAR) at each vial position was checked with a light meter before and after each day's run. Prior to each sample incubation the temperature of the circulating water batch was set to the ambient site temperature and the cooling fan and light bulbs were checked for problems. Quantum Scalar Irradiance Meter; manufacturer: Biospherical Instruments Inc. (model: QSL 101 A1); parameter: PAR (photosynthetically-available radiation) Photosynthetron; manufacturer: CHPT (Composite High Pressure Technology) (model: Custom design by Hugh MacIntyre, Horn Point Laboratory, PO Box 775, Cambridge, MD 21613) Photosynthesis Assay 35 ml of unfiltered sample was placed in a 50 ml polycarbonate centrifuge tube and spiked with 50 µl of 14C bicarbonate (58 mCi/mmol; ICN Biomedical; Catalog #17441H) using a Hamilton syringe. The tube was then capped and the sample mixed by inverting the tube gently several times. The spiked sample was poured into a 100 ml borosilicate beaker and drawn up in a 50 ml Eppendorf repeating pipettor, and 1 ml was dispensed into each of 24 sample vials (7 ml borosilicate glass scintillation vials) and 3 total count vials (7 ml scintillation vials containing 200 µl Phenylethylamine; Sigma Chemical Catalog #P6251). The total count vials were capped and refrigerated, and the sample vials were capped and placed into corresponding positions of the Photosynthetron. The Photosynthetron was then turned on the the samples were incubated for 1 hr. After incubation samples were uncapped, killed with 200 µl 6N HCl, shaken for at least 2 hr to drive off unincorporated bicarbonate, and then capped for transport to the laboratory in Athens, Georgia. After transport, liquid scintillation cocktail (Bio-Safe II, Research Products International) was added to each total count and sample vial, and the activity of 14C measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500) for 5 minutes using a single-labeled 14C program.

LTER_2005,EML,00063-metadata.xml,Related Resource Citation,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project James T. Hollibaugh principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

LTER_2005,EML,00066-metadata.xml,Process Step,"A Campbell 21x data logger has collected weather data at Toolik Lake since June 1988. Sensors that are measured every minute and averaged or totaled every hour include: air temperature and relative humidity at 1 and 5 meters, wind speed at 1 and 5 meters, wind direction at 5 meters, global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, barometric pressure, and unfrozen precipitation. Sensors measured every 10 minutes and averaged every three hours include, soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, and evaporation pan depth and pan water temperature. Net radiation and pan evaporation are only measured during the summer months. The hourly data are in the file yyyyDLTLH.DAT, the three hourly data are in yyyyDLTLO.DAT, and daily summaries are in yyyyDLTLD.DAT. A second Campbell 21x data logger about 700 meters from the main weather station logs air and soil temperatures and photosynthetically active radiation in the experimental treatment plots. Treatments include greenhouse, shading, and fertilization. In the control plot wind speed and direction, global solar radiation and unfrozen precipitation are also measured. This station is also used as a backup to the main weather station. The full description of the sensors and site is in file SENSORS.DOC. The original data is in file yyyyDLTDAT.ZIP, which is archived at The Marine Biological Lab, Woods Hole, MA. Notes: Campbell CS500 temperature/RH sensors were problematic. The splice in the lead Moisture infiltrated the lead wire splice joint and caused a short resulting in bad readings and in the worst case it affected other sensors on the data logger. Backup air temperature/RH and radiation sensors were used to estimate the 5-meter air and temperature/RH sensor and the radiation sensors. Wind Speeds less than .447 are considered calm. For the global solar radiation and photosynthetically active radiation sensors no attempt is made to correct for frost or snow on the sensors during the winter months. Therefore winter radiation data should be view as suspect and used only qualitatively. August 1998 the tipping rain gage was fitted with a Campbell CS705 adapter for measuring snow. A Wyoming windshield was build for the precipitation gage 30Aug99. See additional notes under Comments variable. All missing values are indicated by a #N/A.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

LTER_2005,EML,00070-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Quadrat sampling Quadrats were randomly placed within two nominal marsh zones at each site (eight plots per zone) to create permanent plots in October 2000. These plots were used for this study, in addition to five new plots added to replace original plots lost due to catastrophic disturbance. The quadrats were marked using PVC or wooden stakes and varied in size, measuring 0.5m by 0.5m, 1m by 0.5m, or 0.25m by 0.25m, as indicated in the 'Quadrat_Area' data column. Plant measurement The taxon, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded for each shoot > 10cm in height present in each quadrat. PVC ruler; parameter: length Biomass Calculation Plant biomass was calculated for predominant flowering plants based on the allometric relationships between plant height, flowering status and biomass calculated by site, zone and species using the formula: ln(Biomass) = constant + htslope*ln(Plant_Height) + flslope*ln(Flowering_Status) RTK-GPS Survey of Permanent Plot Locations A survey was performed in April 2010 to measure the precise geographic locations and elevations of long-term plant plots at GCE-LTER marsh study sites 1-10. The survey was performed using a Trimble R6 real-time kinematic GPS sytem with Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) support. The base receiver was placed on a permanent cement base installed near each field site, connected to GLONASS satellite services via mobile 3G Internet connection, and allowed to establish a stable benchmark positional fix prior to the survey. A portable wireless rover unit was then used to collect and log horizontal position and vertical elevation data on the ground at the center of each plot. Data were then corrected and analyzed using Trimble Geomatics Office software to determine latitude, longitude and elevation, and plant plot locations were then registered in the GCE-LTER geographic database. Location, Longitude and Latitude columns were then added to the data table based on matching site, marsh zone and plot number of each record to the corresponding plot identifier in the geographic database. For plots that were lost due to catastrophic disturbance prior to 2010 and replaced, the measured location of the the replacement plots were used to provide estimated positional information for the legacy plots, and the estimated values were flagged and the level of uncertainty was described based on the number of times the plot was replaced prior to RTK-GPS survey.

Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island. This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock). -81.295506 -81.258908 31.497026 31.462320 Plant Survey Permanent plots were established in the marsh areas at each GCE sampling site in October, 2000. Each site was divided into two nominal zones based on marsh structure -- creek zone and high marsh -- and eight plots were randomly located in each zone and marked with stakes. In October 2001 plots were examined for signs of disturbance by wrack inundation, animal activity, and creek bank erosion. The following plots were lost due to catastrophic disturbance and replaced with new plots as indicated: site 6, zone 1, plot 3 (not replaced); site 8 zone 1 plots 5, 6, 7, 8 (added new plots 15, 16, 17, 18); site 9, zone 1, plot 4 (added new plot 14). New plots were not in exactly the same locations as lost plots, and so have new numbers. A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2001 to measure the species and size distribution of plants in the permanent plots at 10 GCE LTER sampling sites. A stratified random quadrat sampling design was used to determine the species and size distribution of plants in two nominal marsh zones (creek and high marsh) at each GCE LTER sampling site.

LTER_2005,EML,00070-metadata.xml,Related Resource Citation,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project James T. Hollibaugh principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

LTER_2005,EML,00070-metadata.xml,Project Description,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project James T. Hollibaugh principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Automatically-assigned qualifier flags are reviewed graphically and revised or augmented as deemed appropriate by GCE information management staff, based on metadata information from the contributor, values of other measured variables, or statistical tests. Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column.",/eml:eml/dataset/dataTable/methods/qualityControl,"//methods/qualityControl"

LTER_2005,EML,00071-metadata.xml,Process Step,"SAMPLING BACKGROUNDThe forest was first sampled in 1965. The hydrology has been monitored since 1963. Surveys were initiated in 1965, repeated in 1977, and repeated at 5 year intervals after that. These data were collected in the summer of 1997. The stream water chemistry has been monitored since 1963. The watershed is forested by typical northern hardwood species (sugar maple, beech and yellow birch) on the lower 90% of its area and by a montane boreal transition forest of red spruce, balsam fir and white birch on the highest 10%. Surveying techniques were used in 1965 to install a grid system of 208 grid cells, each 25 x 25 m square. These grid units serve as the plot system. See the following links for more information: http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/maps/w6_zones.htm and http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/w6_grid_elevations.htm.SAMPLING DESIGNThe inventory consists of a total inventory of all trees >=10 cm dbh on the whole of the watershed (13.23 ha), as measured in each of the 208 25 m x 25 m plots. Trees >=2 to <=10 cm dbh were subsampled using a 3 meter wide strip along one edge of each 25 m x 25 m plot (see plot layout). The lengths of these strips are not always exactly 25 meters, due to drift or imprecise replacement of the corner stakes. The actual measured length of the strip is used to calculate the area of the plot (as given in the data) for the smaller trees. For the larger trees, plot area was not adjusted for drift and is assumed to be 625 sq. meters. See http://hubbardbrook.org/w6_tour/biomass-stop/sampling.htm for more information.DATA DESCRIPTIONThe data consist of the diameters (dbh) of all trees >=10 cm dbh, live and dead, in the whole of the watershed (8451 individual stems). Dead trees were recorded as standing dead trees (trees dead but retaining most of their fine branches) and as snags (trees broken off above dbh or with only their major large branches still intact). Live trees were noted 'sick' if they had very sparse foliage or yellowing foliage in the mid summer sampling. A subsample of trees >=2 cm dbh and <=10cm dbh were measured at the same time (2970 individual stems). All stems that met the size criteria were measured individually, and in some years it was noted whether a stem was part of a group of stems from the same tree (i.e. multiple stems that split from a single trunk below breast height). For W6, whether or not a stem was part of a group was not recorded until 2002.NOTESIt is not possible to compare these data between sampling years on a plot by plot basis, since trees are not individually tagged and plot corners have shifted slightly over time. At the time of the 1977 and 1982 inventories, many of the aluminum rods marking plot corners had come out and were replaced but not resurveyed. Also trees on the lines between plots can 'drift' between plots between years depending on the observers line of sight or decision as to whether the center of the base of a tree is in one plot or the adjoining plot. In 1989 we prepared maps of each plot on which we outlined edge trees and assigned them to one plot or another. These maps have been copied on the backs of the field data collection sheets in the more recent years such that problem trees can be assigned consistently. For extensive notes about the details of these surveys and subsequent calculations, see the notes indicated at the bottom of the interactive calculation programs.CALCULATIONSAboveground and belowground biomass was estimated for each stem in the inventory and is included in the data. Estimates were based on species-specific allometric equations developed at Hubbard Brook. See 'How do we quantify a forest?' for details. Phytosociology or biomass summaries can be obtained by using our interactive calculators. Phytosociology summaries include basal area, density and frequency of each species for the watershed as a whole or for smaller units as chosen by the user. Diameter distributions for a specific species can also be selected. Biomass summaries include biomass estimates by plant part for each species for the watershed as a whole or for smaller units as chosen by the user. Options to estimate productivity and total nutrient pools in the vegetation are also available.

LTER_2005,EML,00072-metadata.xml,Abstract,"The effects of disturbance, terrain shape, and soil chemistry on the diversity and abundance of cove forest herbs was studied in mesic forests. Herb communities were sampled using 250-400 m transects. These transects were placed in (a) highly disturbed, small patches of forest; (b) highly disturbed, large patches; and (c) relatively undisturbed, large patches. Herb diversity/abundance, terrain shape, and soil chemistry was sampled at a 10-m resolution. Species richness was greatest in the least disturbed sites in large patches. Disturbance negatively affected the coverage of old-growth indicator species, lilies, and mesophytic species. Differences in patch size, given the same level of disturbance, did not significantly affect the coverage of old-growth indicators and mesophytic species. Weedy species were most abundant in small patches. Disturbance had no significant effect on these weedy species in large patches. The abiotic factors having the greatest influence on coverage of cove and mesophytic species were: soil humic matter and soil pH. Terrain shape, soil cations, P and Ca were correlated with soil humic matter and pH.Herbaceous communities were sampled at sites have three levels of disturbance: low (no evidence of past disturbance or logged >1920), moderate (logged >1 time since 1870), high (previous agricultural use, woodland grazing and/or logging). There were 3, 6, and 4 sites at the low, moderate, and high disturbance levels, respectively. Each site was sampled using transect 250-400 m long, sampled every 2 m using a 0.5 m2 quadrat. In each quadrat, the count and percent coverage was recorded for each species. During analysis, five quadrats along a 10-m sections of the transects were summed. This 10-m data corresponds to the scale of soil and terrain shape measurements. Every 10 m along the transect, a soil sample was taken and a measure of terrain shape was calculated. The soil was taken from the top 10cm of soil (A horizon). These samples were analyzed for soil humic matter and chemical properties. Terrain shape was assessed by measuring the slope at eight points located 50 m from the transect at the cardinal and subcardinal directions. The sum of this slope provides an index of terrain shape (i.e., >0=concave terrain, less than 0=convex).",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00074-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Phenological data were collected weekly for permanently tagged plants located in 14 permanent plots (refered to as the nodal plots) in the Niwot Ridge Saddle area. 12 of the plots represent the 6 plant communities or noda (two from each nodum) identified in the Saddle (May 1973). The two remaing plots were located adjacent to two temporary snowfences erected near Saddle grid stake 49. The plots were 1x10 m, and were further divided into 10, 1x1 m quadrats. Plant species studied include Acomastylis rossii, Bistorta bistortoides and Bistorta vivipara. Ten individuals of each species present in a plot were randomly selected. Plants were tagged approximately two inches behind each plant with an aluminum tag labelled with the species abbreviation and plant number. Tagged plant locations were determined using a Cartesian coordinate system with the outside corner of quadrat 1 serving as the origin.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

The PAR measurements at both the surface and at each depth were taken using flat-faced, 'cosine-corrected' Licor underwater quantum sensors attached to the datasonde 4. Secchi depth was measured using 22-cm disk.Notes: The Hydrolab was calibrated weekly for Oxygen, using the Barometer in the Surveyor 4. Conductivity, and pH were also calibrated weekly using commercial standards. Because of the low conductivity of the waters around Toolik the potassium chloride (KCl) concentration in the reference electrode was changed weekly prior to calibration.GEO-1None",/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"/eml:eml/*/methods"

LTER_2005,EML,00078-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Plant phenology or life-history pattern changes seasonally as plants grow, mature, flower, and produce fruit and seeds. Plant phenology follows seasonal patterns, yet annual variation may occur due to annual differences in the timing of rainfall and ambient temperature shifts. Foliage growth and fruit and seed production are important aspects of plant population dynamics and food resource availability for animals. The purpose of this study is to assess plant phenology patterns across a series of biotic communities that represent an environmental moisture gradient. These communites include: Chihuhuan Desert creosotebush shrubland, Chihuahuan Desert black grama grassland, and blue grama grassland. Plant phenology is recorded for all plant species across 4 replicate 200 m transects at each of the 3 habitat sites. Plant phenology measurements are taken once every month from February through October. The first ten individuals of each plant species encountered along each transect are assessed for life-history status. Data recorded include the status of leaves, flowers and fruit. Leaves are recorded as new, old, brown or absent. Reproductive status is recorded as absent, buds, flowers, fruits or both fruits and flowers. Data from the site P and J were only collected in 2000 and 2001 and are included in this data set.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00078-metadata.xml,Maintenance,"12/2/2008For both 2007 and 2008, individual monthly files were checked for errors and compiled in pc_field/phenology. These were uploaded into navicat. Then all the data was exported and put on line with this updated meta data and EML.2/8/2007Phenology data from 2001-2006 was taken out of flat files and imported into MySQL. Once in the database, I checked for duplicates. These most often happened when a recorder had already taken data for a particular species and accidentally started a new row for data for that species. In these instances, no data was deleted, but the observation numbers were made consecutive. Therefore, they end up with more than 10 observations per web. In no case was this more than 20. The other reason I found duplicates was in years where certain recorders collected separate data for seedlings and adults. In these cases, no data was thrown away and againg the observation number was made consecutive and there also can be up to 20 observations per web for these species. Always in this case the comment 'SEEDLING' was added to the relevant observations. I also checked every plant code against the USDA Plants database online at http://plants.usda.gov/ All plant codes that have had nomenclature changes were updated. All previously unknown plants that have since been identified were also updated. All unknown plants that will never be identified were dropped from the database. All typos were corrected.

LTER_2005,EML,00078-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Locating the Transects:Phenological conditions are recorded along four permanently marked 200 m x 2 m wide transects at each of the core study sites. The transects are located within four of the five rodent trapping webs. All five transects were originally measured, but in 2003 the least diverse transect at each site was dropped. Each web consists of twelve 100 m transects radiating as spokes from a central rebar stake marked #145. As measured from the center stake, the first four stakes within a ray are positioned at 5 m intervals and the remaining eight at 10 m intervals along a given transect. Plant phenology is recorded along two of these 100 m transects, the transect that extends due north from the central stake and the transect that extends due south from the central stake. The stakes that extend due north are marked 1-12 where stake #1 is closest to the center stake. The stakes that extend due south are marked 73-84 where stake #73 is closest to center. Collecting the Data:Each transect is sampled by one technician. Measurements are started from the northern (stake #12) end of each transect. The technician walks in a straight line from one stake to the next surveying a 1 m wide area on each side of the line until the opposite end of the transect is reached. As a transect is walked, phenological conditions are recorded for each species that occurs along the transect. The phenological condition of the first 10 individuals of each species is recorded. After the conditions of ten individuals have been recorded no more observations are made for that particular species even though more may be encountered. Conversely, for rare species only a few individuals may be encountered so there will be less than 10 observations.Because measurements are taken on separate individuals, it is important to note that many plants have clonal growth forms. This can be seen in some grasses that occur as a clump of overlapping vegetation. In this case each clump is treated as a single individual. This is also true for some cactus and yucca species that appear as a cluster of many individual heads.Determining Phenological Conditions:1. New green foliage (N)This category refers to a plant that is producing new vegetative tissue. The production of new vegetative tissue can be characterized in several ways depending on the species. In many herbaceous plants, new vegetative growth will be indicated by the presence of immature leaves or stems. In herbaceous plants this growth generally appears near the tips of shoots and also at axillary buds.For species that have a rosette growth form (yucca, some herbaceous plants), the center of the rosette is examined for the presence of immature leaves.In cacti, the spines are modified leaves and do not readily indicate new vegetative growth so cacti are examined for production of new stems. For example, in Opuntia spp., the presence of a new stem/pad represents new green foliage as each stem-joint represents a season's growth. Cacti that exhibit a cylindrical growth form are more difficult to classify. Cacti with tuberculate stems (Mammilaria spp.) are examined for new tubercules which can often be seen in the center of the head. More problematic are the ribbed cacti where the growth of one season is continuous with that of the preceding season.  While these species may be producing new growth it is extremely difficult to identify and thus they are usually categorized as old green foliage.2. Old green foliage (O)This category refers to a plant that is not producing new vegetative tissue but exhibits only mature green foliage.  3. Brown leaves (B)This category refers to a plant that has only brown leaves and is used to indicate a period of senescence or decline.  4. No leaves (Z)This category is similar to the above category.  It is meant to capture a period of senescence or decline and refers to a plant that has subsequently dropped its leaves. It only applies to growth forms that drop their leaves during a period of dormancy or senescence. This category is not used for plants such as Ephedra spp. that normally do not have leaves.Determining Phenological Conditions:1. New flowers (FL)This category refers to the presence of flowers at anthesis (open flowers). For many species the petals are large and showy making this condition easy to identify. In species with small or reduced flowers, this condition represents the presence of key reproductive structures such as stamens and/or carpels.   2. New fruit (FR)This category refers to the presence of a ripened ovary that contains seed. Open fruits that do not contain seed are not categorized as fruiting.  Open fruits that do contain seed belong in this category.               3. Fruits and Flowers (FF)This category indicates that both fruit and flowers are present.4. No Fruits or Flowers (Z)This category indicates that neither fruits or flowers are present.5. Flower buds (B)This category indicates that only closed flower buds are present.QAQC: Each month, the data is QAQCd for typos and incorrect plant codes.

The plant list and the unknown plant list should be updated regularly. Check all errors against the paper data. Be sure that the numbers at the end of the kartez codes are correct. In most cases, all errors can be fixed at this time.At the end of every year, compile all the data into one file for the year. Check to make sure no data is missing or duplicated. Also, each year, all the previous years data should be updated using the unknown plant list to replace former unknowns with their proper kartez code. At this point all compiled, yearly data sets should be re-archived, replacing the old data sets. Meta data should be maintained with every data set.Recording the Data:For each transect, the following is recorded:   1. Recorder- Recorder's initials and also the initials of anyone helping take measurements on that particular transect.  2. The date (month, day, year)  3. The site (B, G, C, J, P)B = Blue grama grasslandG = Five-Points grasslandC = Five-Points creosoteJ = Juniper SavannaP = Pinon-Juniper woodland 4. The web (1,2,3,4,5) 5. The page number (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)The species code for all the species occurring along the transect is recorded. Then the phenological conditions of the individual plants in the area are recorded in the Fol and Flw columns of the data sheet. The Fol column is for status codes reflecting the condition of a plant's foliage and the Flw column is for codes reflecting the reproductive status of the plant. The status codes are as follows:Foliage codes:N = new green foliageO = old green foliage onlyB = brown leaves onlyZ = no leavesReproductive codes:FL = new flowerFR = new fruitsFF = new fruits and flowersZ = no fruits or flowersB  = Only buds presentBFL = Buds and flowersBFR = Buds and fruits The phenology data is taken with paper and pencil.

LTER_2005,EML,00078-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,"Locating the Transects:Phenological conditions are recorded along four permanently marked 200 m x 2 m wide transects at each of the core study sites. The transects are located within four of the five rodent trapping webs. All five transects were originally measured, but in 2003 the least diverse transect at each site was dropped. Each web consists of twelve 100 m transects radiating as spokes from a central rebar stake marked #145. As measured from the center stake, the first four stakes within a ray are positioned at 5 m intervals and the remaining eight at 10 m intervals along a given transect. Plant phenology is recorded along two of these 100 m transects, the transect that extends due north from the central stake and the transect that extends due south from the central stake. The stakes that extend due north are marked 1-12 where stake #1 is closest to the center stake. The stakes that extend due south are marked 73-84 where stake #73 is closest to center. Collecting the Data:Each transect is sampled by one technician. Measurements are started from the northern (stake #12) end of each transect. The technician walks in a straight line from one stake to the next surveying a 1 m wide area on each side of the line until the opposite end of the transect is reached. As a transect is walked, phenological conditions are recorded for each species that occurs along the transect. The phenological condition of the first 10 individuals of each species is recorded. After the conditions of ten individuals have been recorded no more observations are made for that particular species even though more may be encountered. Conversely, for rare species only a few individuals may be encountered so there will be less than 10 observations.Because measurements are taken on separate individuals, it is important to note that many plants have clonal growth forms. This can be seen in some grasses that occur as a clump of overlapping vegetation. In this case each clump is treated as a single individual. This is also true for some cactus and yucca species that appear as a cluster of many individual heads.Determining Phenological Conditions:1. New green foliage (N)This category refers to a plant that is producing new vegetative tissue. The production of new vegetative tissue can be characterized in several ways depending on the species. In many herbaceous plants, new vegetative growth will be indicated by the presence of immature leaves or stems. In herbaceous plants this growth generally appears near the tips of shoots and also at axillary buds.For species that have a rosette growth form (yucca, some herbaceous plants), the center of the rosette is examined for the presence of immature leaves.In cacti, the spines are modified leaves and do not readily indicate new vegetative growth so cacti are examined for production of new stems. For example, in Opuntia spp., the presence of a new stem/pad represents new green foliage as each stem-joint represents a season's growth. Cacti that exhibit a cylindrical growth form are more difficult to classify. Cacti with tuberculate stems (Mammilaria spp.) are examined for new tubercules which can often be seen in the center of the head. More problematic are the ribbed cacti where the growth of one season is continuous with that of the preceding season.  While these species may be producing new growth it is extremely difficult to identify and thus they are usually categorized as old green foliage.2. Old green foliage (O)This category refers to a plant that is not producing new vegetative tissue but exhibits only mature green foliage.  3. Brown leaves (B)This category refers to a plant that has only brown leaves and is used to indicate a period of senescence or decline.  4. No leaves (Z)This category is similar to the above category.  It is meant to capture a period of senescence or decline and refers to a plant that has subsequently dropped its leaves. It only applies to growth forms that drop their leaves during a period of dormancy or senescence. This category is not used for plants such as Ephedra spp. that normally do not have leaves.Determining Phenological Conditions:1. New flowers (FL)This category refers to the presence of flowers at anthesis (open flowers). For many species the petals are large and showy making this condition easy to identify. In species with small or reduced flowers, this condition represents the presence of key reproductive structures such as stamens and/or carpels.   2. New fruit (FR)This category refers to the presence of a ripened ovary that contains seed. Open fruits that do not contain seed are not categorized as fruiting.  Open fruits that do contain seed belong in this category.               3. Fruits and Flowers (FF)This category indicates that both fruit and flowers are present.4. No Fruits or Flowers (Z)This category indicates that neither fruits or flowers are present.5. Flower buds (B)This category indicates that only closed flower buds are present.QAQC: Each month, the data is QAQCd for typos and incorrect plant codes.

LTER_2005,EML,00079-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Grasshopper abundance and species diversity were investigated at eight sampling sites within the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER study area in August 2003. Visual surveys were conducted along 8 2m by 10m transects randomly allocated within the mid-marsh zone at each site. All grasshoppers observed within each transect were counted and identified to species, if possible. This survey was conducted as part of the GCE invertebrate monitoring program, and will be performed annually to assess long-term changes in relative species abundances across the GCE study area.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

Transitional salt marsh/upland forest site at the upper reach of the Sapelo River near Eulonia, Georgia. The main marsh area is to the north of the channel where the upland is controlled by DNR. Several small creeks lie within the study area. Residential development is increasing on the upland areas south of the channel. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to a private dock to the south of the main channel near the HW-17 bridge. -81.428481 -81.410732 31.546750 31.533963 GCE Study Site GCE2 -- Four Mile Island, Georgia, USA. Low salt marsh/estuary site encompassing the southwestern end of Four Mile Island and the Sapelo River near Sapelo Sound. The large island is totally marsh, with no upland, and no development. Nearby areas, like 'Sutherland Bluff', are developing with golf courses. A hydrographic sonde is deployed within this site attached to channel marker 4 (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). Salinity regime is similar to seawater. -81.318961 -81.292844 31.552554 31.533604 GCE Study Site GCE3 -- North Sapelo, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. High salinity marsh/Sapelo Sound site. Few or no small creeks, but one large creek is easily accessed. Further upstream upland drainage is affected by culvert at Reynolds' duck pond. Upland is heavily forested. Hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site attached to a channel marker (under U.S. Coast Guard permit). A huge mud flat is present at the northern tip of Sapelo Island. -81.233249 -81.195661 31.546868 31.515188 GCE Study Site GCE4 -- Meridian, Georgia, USA. Inland marsh and tidal creek site near Meridian, Georgia. The primary marsh site is to the south of the dock in front of the Sapelo Island Visitor Center. Some small creeks and one large creek (Hudson Creek) are present. Upland is heavily forested. Marsh to the north of the dock can be used for additional studies if larger areas are required. Upland to the North is being developed for residential use, so future access is uncertain. The USGS super station site (weather station plus multiple-sensor sonde) is deployed off the ferry dock. Salinity is similar to seawater because there is little freshwater input from the upland. -81.370752 -81.357256 31.463533 31.448419 GCE Study Site GCE5 -- Folly River, Georgia, USA. Salt marsh/tidal creek site at the Folly River near Doboy Sound. No upland areas present. The north side of Doboy Sound immediately opposite is similar, but creeks are not as nice. No existing markers are close enough for sonde deployment, so we will initially use the existing sonde at Marsh Landing operated by UGAMI for surrogate hydrographic data. -81.354413 -81.327201 31.442538 31.417640 GCE Study Site GCE6 -- Dean Creek, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse. A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity and genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu) -81.299522 -81.264378 31.394072 31.371003 GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA.

Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island. This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock). -81.295506 -81.258908 31.497026 31.462320 Grasshopper Survey Permanent plots were established in the marsh areas at each GCE sampling site in October, 2000. Eight plots were placed near drainage creeks (creek zone) and eight were placed in the high marsh (high marsh zone) at each site. Grasshopper abundance and species diversity were determined at eight GCE LTER sampling sites by performing 8 visual transect surveys in the mid-marsh zone at each site. Transects measured 2m x 10m, and were randomly allocated within each site. All grasshoppers observed within the transect area were enumerated and identified to species, or grouped into the 'other grasshoppers' category (G0).

LTER_2005,EML,00079-metadata.xml,Related Resource Citation,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project James T. Hollibaugh principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

Vertical CTD profiles were collected at various intervals from 0km to 29km along the transect during various tidal regimes. Conductivity, temperature, pressure, optical back scatter, photosynthetically-available radiation, oxygen and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected during the upcast were deleted. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

The toolbox is based on the GCE Data Structure, a MATLAB specification for storing tabular data along with all information required to interpret the data and generate formatted metadata (documentation). Metadata fields in the structure are queried by toolbox functions for all operations, allowing functions to process and format values appropriately based on the type of information they represent. This semantic processing approach supports highly automated and intelligent data analysis and ensures data set validity throughout all processing steps.",/eml:eml/dataset/dataTable/methods/methodStep/software/abstract/para,Undefined

LTER_2005,EML,00081-metadata.xml,Abstract,"The daily data are summarized to monthly as follows: Daily average CFS are summed for each month and multiplied by 86400 (seconds per day) to yield cubic feet per month. This value is divided by the particular watershed area and multiplied by another conversion factor to yield cm water equivalent depth discharged by each watershed per month. This allows direct hydrologic comparison of watersheds of different sizes. Time series plots illustrate the biennial periodicity of high and low discharges, and particular floods and droughts. October 1970 was the historic flood for PR, recently exceeded during the passage of Hurricane Hortense in September 1996. The historic drought occurred during 1993-1994 and is clearly visible in these records. Table 1. United States Geological Survey (USGS) streamflow records from the Luquillo Experimental Forest. The periods of record presented here end with the 1994 water year (except for those stations whose records ended earlier). Watershed records are subdivided (a,b, etc.) when substantial gaps exist. The watersheds indicated with abbreviations are those where streamwater chemistry has also been measured.

It has a warm and wet climate and includes a variety of tropical habitats and forest types and streams, and a high diversity of plants and animals. A key feature of these ecosystems is disturbance. Hurricanes, landslides, and human disturbance have shaped the forest, and research by LUQ has stimulated a new appreciation of the significance of large-scale disturbances in tropical forested ecosystems and the key role of plants and animals in shaping the response to these events. Hurricanes occurring one and 10 years after LUQ began in 1988 provided landscape-scale natural experiments which are still followed closely.-65.92-65.718.3518.23201060meter",/eml:eml/dataset/coverage/geographicCoverage,"/eml:eml/*/coverage/geographicCoverage"

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

LTER_2005,EML,00084-metadata.xml,Abstract,"One hydrographic survey was performed on December 2, 2003, along the Darien River, North River, and north channel of the Altamaha River (Inner Marsh Transect, GCE-IM). Vertical CTD profiles were collected at various nominal stations along the transect under a low water tidal regime (flood tide). Conductivity, temperature, pressure and optical backscatter were measured, and depth, salinity and sigma-t were calculated for each profile. Data values collected on the upcast were deleted, and the remaining data were averaged within 0.5m depth bins and interpolated to produce a smooth profile for contouring. This data set was collected as part of the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER quarterly hydrographic monitoring program.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

The CTD was lowered to just below the water surface and allowed to equilibrate for 45-60 seconds, then lowered at approximately 0.25-0.5m/s to within 1m of the bottom. Data was stored using an internal data logger, and uploaded to a shipboard computer at the end of each transect.

(model: SBE 19-03); parameter: temperature (range: -5.0 to +35.0°C); last calibration: Jul 24, 2003 CTD Profile Post-processing Raw profile data were processed using Sea-Bird Electronics DATACNV program (www.seabird.com) to convert instrument readings to calibrated data and to calculate derived parameters (i.e. depth from pressure; salinity, density and sigma-t from conductivity, temperature and pressure; oxygen saturation from dissolved oxygen). The data then underwent a quality control process, which included removal of the soaking time period, removal of decreasing pressure during the profile due to ship and wave motion, removal of the upcast information (i.e. data after the instrument has hit bottom), removal of spikes in any of the parameters, application of flow-through time delays for the oxygen (0.5 s) and fluormeter (3.75 s) sensors, calculation of PAR depth to account for the physical separation between the PAR and pressure sensors (~0.75m). The quality control operations were performed using custom Matlab programs developed by D. DiIorio and K. Kang. CTD Profile Bin-averaging After post-processing, a subset of profile parameters (depth, temperature, conductivity, salinity, density, sigma-t, suspended particulates) were averaged over 0.5 m depth bins starting at 0.25m below the surface. The fast sampling of the CTD (8Hz) together with the profile speed (~1m/s) resulted in approximately 5 samples in this average. Linear interpolation was then carried out using custom Matlab programs developed by D. DiIorio and K. Kang to produce estimated values at exact depth increments of 0.5m starting at 1.0m depth below the surface. 2003-12-02 GCE Study Site GCE-IM -- Inner Marsh, Georgia, USA.

Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

LTER_2005,EML,00085-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Two ares of Niwot Ridge were examined for simultaneous occurrences of krummholz and eskers created by Thomomys talpoides (Northern pocket gopher) burrowing, in order to establish a relationship between snowpack and gopher habitat. The krummholz east and northeast of the Martinelli slope and the krummholz north of T-van were surveyed for the abundance of gopher eskers. Using a tape measure, the minimum and maximum distances of the eskers from the krummholz vegetation were measured, with a value of 0 m indicating that the nearest soil core was immediately adjacent to or actually underlying a branch of the tree. With the use of a compass, both the northernmost and southernmost bearings were measured from the krummholz to the esker. The krummholz were tagged at the northeasternmost point whenever possible for consistency, or the northernmost branches of the leeward side of the tree island. All measurements were taken from the nearest protruberance of the krummholz.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

LTER_2005,EML,00086-metadata.xml,Process Step,"Water Collection Water samples were collected from the R/V Savannah approximately 1 meter below the surface using a Niskin bottle sampler deployed using a hydrographic winch. The water sample was then transferred to brown 1 L Nalgene bottles, which were pre-rinsed once with approximately 100 ml of sample water prier to filling. Surface samples collected from the R/V Salty Dawg and Carolina Skiff were collected by hand approximately 0.5 meters below the surface of the water using a brown 1 L Nalgene bottle rinsed once with sample water. Sample Incubation Four sterile 2 ml centrifuge tubes were individually numbered and 5µL of leucine stock solution (20 nM final concentration) was added to each tube [L-(4-5) 3H-Leucine Amersham corparation cat# TRK510, ca. 150mCi/mmol]. Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) was added to the first tube in each series (89µl of 100% TCA, final concentration of 5%) to function as a killed control. 1.7ml of sample was added into each tube, and the tubes were vortexed and incubated at ambient tempertures for one hour. At the end of the incubation period live samples were fixed with 89 ul 100% TCA and vortexed. Samples were then stored refrigerated and transported to the laboratory for processing. (reference: Smith, D.C., Azam, F., 1992. A simple, economical method for measuring bacterial protein synthesis rates in seawater using 3H-leucine. Marine Microbial Food Webs 6:107-114.) Leucine Incorporation Measurement Samples were warmed to room temperture and spun for 10 minutes in a bench-top centrifuge at top speed. The supernatant was removed by vacuum aspiration, taking care not to disturb the pellet. The pellet was then resuspended with 1.5ml of 5% TCA using a vortex mixer, and the centrifugation and aspiration step was repeated to rinse the precipitate. 1.5ml of biodegradable scintillation fluid was then added directly into the tube and the suspension was mixed by vortexing. Radioactivity in each tube was measured by liquid scintillation counting (LSC), and disintegrations per minute were calculated from counts per minute by the scintillation counter software based on calculated count efficiency for the samples.

Doboy Sound/salt marsh site at the southern end of Sapelo Island near Dean Creek and the Sapelo lighthouse. A few small creeks are present, but a large creek (Dean Creek) is easily accessed. Upland is composed of small hammocks and some constructed causeways, with sand dune complexes east of Dean Creek and extending to the beach. Upper end of the watershed is affected by a culvert at Beach Road and heavy student use of marsh immediately adjacent to culvert. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in Doboy Sound near Commodore Island approximately 1.5km from this site. GCE6 is also the focus of Sapelo Island Microbial Observatory research on microbial diversity and genomics (http://simo.marsci.uga.edu) -81.299522 -81.264378 31.394072 31.371003 GCE Study Site GCE7 -- Carrs Island, Georgia, USA. Freshwater marsh site along the northern bank of Hammersmith Creek at the south end of Carrs Island. Upland area is heavily forested. Northern 3/4 of the island was diked for rice agriculture, but the southern 1/4 is undisturbed. A hydrographic sonde is deployed in the Altamaha River near Hammersmith Creek, adjacent to this site. -81.493498 -81.475900 31.348774 31.334364 GCE Study Site GCE8 -- Alligator Creek, Georgia, USA. Mid-estuary/salt marsh site on the west side of Friday Cap Creek along the Altamaha River. This is a brackish marsh with salinities around 14 PSU during drought, less than 5 PSU normally. A hydrographic sonde is deployed adjacent to this site in the Altamaha River near Alligator Creek, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 2 pilings. -81.426272 -81.410634 31.317808 31.304063 GCE Study Site GCE9 -- Rockdedundy Island, Georgia, USA. Lower estuary tidal creek and marsh site at Rockdedundy Island west of Wolf Island. A hydrographic sonde is deployed approximately 2km from this site in the Altamaha River near Rockdedundy Island, attached to the US Coast Guard Daymarker 201 pilings. -81.346730 -81.326495 31.358142 31.339173 GCE Study Site GCE10 -- Hunt Camp, Sapelo Island, Georgia, USA. Barrier island/marsh site on western Sapelo Island. This site is located at the upper reaches of the Duplin River, and is within the Sapelo Island National Estuarine Research Reserve. Existing well fields border small marsh area to northwest, some wells have been installed to south end of hammock where marsh is more extensive and permanent plots are located. Two existing hydrographic sondes and weather stations within this site are operated by SINERR (Hunt Camp dock) and UGAMI (flume dock). -81.295506 -81.258908 31.497026 31.462320 GCE Study Site GCE-SP -- Sapelo River, Georgia, USA. Sapelo River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 3-4km from 0km to 36km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.431980 -81.154122 31.559628 31.516636 GCE Study Site GCE-DB -- Doboy Sound, Georgia, USA. Doboy Sound transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -2km to 12km and at 12.6km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main sound channel. -81.368240 -81.242954 31.455664 31.340942 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. Altamaha River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -4km to 40km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.582311 -81.237936 31.401403 31.296034 GCE Study Site GCE-DP -- Duplin River, Georgia, USA. Duplin River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys.

LTER_2005,EML,00086-metadata.xml,Related Resource Citation,"Georgia Coastal Ecosystems LTER Project James T. Hollibaugh principalInvestigator Steven C. Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest.-71.2198-70.756842.827642.49650100meter",/eml:eml/dataset/project,"/eml:eml/*/project"

The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest.-71.2198-70.756842.827642.49650100meter",/eml:eml/dataset/project,"/eml:eml/*/project"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.National Science Foundation under Grant # 9910514The FCE LTER Project Study area is located in South Florida, mostly in Everglades National Park.

These consist of locations along a 50 meter transect 5 meters apart where permanent gas flux chambers were lcoated and soil samples taken. The depth of the chambers varied where there was a slope, The hight of the chambers above ground was about 20 cm. For each chamber, the average of the high and low sides were used to calculate the average high of the chamber wall above the forest floor surface. This was used to calcuate the volume of the headspace for each individual chamber. The inside diameter of the chambers was 27 cm. To insure an effective seal, groves were machined into the walls of the chambers to accomedate an 'O' ring. The chambers were sealed with clear plexiglass. All chambers were cleared of all vegetation before respiration measurements were made.</p> <p>Soil respiration was measured using indicating soda lime with a mesh of 6/12 (Fisher #S201-3). The increase in weight is directly proportional to the amount of CO2 adsorbed during the incubation period. Thirty grams of soda lime was added to 8 oz glass jars fitted with gastight metal lids. They were heated uncovered for 8 hr at 100C to remove moisture. At time 0 the jars were placed on metal mesh stands within a incubation chambers which were permanently installed in the ground with the edges buried to a depth of 10 cm. Twenty four hours later, the lids were placed back on the jars and returned to the laboratory where they were again dried (with lid off) at 100øC for 8 hr.</p> <p>At each site, there was one control jar used to determine background CO2 levels and the uptake of CO2 during drying (jar was placed in a sealed chamber sealed on both ends). Bulk density measurements were made in soils adjacent to the chambers as indicated. Soil moisture was measured in two ways; (1) either gravimeterically from bulk density cores or (2) using a Time-Domain Reflectometer (TDR). The TDR used was a Tektronix model 1502B cable tester (Textronix, Beaverton, OR).

Greenhouses and shade houses were annually set up in late May or early June and removed in the end of August or early September. Greenhouses and shade houses were discontinued in 1989. There are 4 replicate blocks, each containing 1 replicate of each of the following treatments. Control fertilized greenhouse greenhouse fertilized shade Notes: Cassiope was not separated into leaves and stems. Weights for Cassiope were recorded as leaf weights. Only control and fertilized plots were harvested. Calculations: Units; Tissue mass data are expressed in g/quadrat (400 cm2). Multiply by 25 to get g/m2. Sampling Description. Biomass quadrats, size 20x20 cm, were taken from Toolik tussock site. Five quadrats were taken from each of four blocks. All aboveground biomass were clipped in 20x20 cm quadrats. Five quadrats were randomly located along line transects in each of four replicate blocks in each treatment. Aboveground biomass is considered 'within' the quadrat if it is associated with a meristem that is within the quadrat. Quadrats were sorted within 24 hours into species and then into tissue type. Depending on the harvest, tissue types can be broad categories, i.e. above and below, or more detailed, i.e. inflorescence, new growth, old growth, etc. Leaf area was measured with a LiCor LI-3000A area meter. Leaf areas for graminoids, deciduous, and forbs were measured immediately after plucking and before drying. Leaf areas for Evergreen species (except Ledum) were measured after drying for 2-4 days. Leaf areas for Ledum were measured after final dry weights were done. Cassiope leaf areas were measured on the unseparated leaves and stems. The samples were dried at 50-70 degrees C in a drying oven and after several days weighed to nearest milligram. Samples are then returned to Woods Hole for nutrient analysis.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

LTER_2005,EML,00097-metadata.xml,Abstract,"Members of the Desmognathus complex have geographically isolated populations throughout their range and reproductive isolation between populations has been documented for most species. It is generally thought that geographic and the associated behavioral isolation has played a major role in the diversification of this genus (Tilley et al. 1978, Tilley et al. 1990). Desmognathus monticola does not appear to adhere to the typical pattern of geographic isolation observed elsewhere in the genus. The range of D. monticola has been proposed to extend between southern Pennsylvania and Georgia with a disjunct, state-endangered population recently reported in the Red Hills of Alabama (Conant and Collins 1991). The initial question presented is whether the entire range of D. monticola consists of disjunct, isolated populations, or if the Alabama population is unique in being isolated from a continuous northern range. To date, insufficient fieldwork has limited the documentation of the entire range of the species and it is possible that the Alabama population may not, in fact, be disjunct. If it is truly disjunct, then two hypotheses can be proposed. This population could be a recent derivative from the main range or an ancestral group that was isolated during the glaciation of the Appalachian Mountains. These hypotheses have not yet been tested. Establishment of a network of population relatedness will provide needed insights into this question. Additionally, D. monticola populations have no documented reproductive behavioral isolation between populations (Mabry pers. com). Lack of behavioral isolation in D. monticola as compared to its congeners may indicate that it is a recently derived species. To date, studies of Desmognathus have employed enzyme electrophoresis to examine genetic diversity, but little variation has been reported using isozyme data (Tilley et al. 1978). Similarly, our preliminary allozyme studies on D. monticola have revealed little genetic variation. Thus, a hypervariable DNA technique, such as Intersimple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs), is necessary to examine the genetic diversity within and among populations of this species. ISSR data are dominant/recessive markers that are scored as band present or absent (Gupta et al. 1994, Zietkiewicz et al. 1994). It is possible to construct a similarity matrix, examine the degree of differences both within and between populations, and establish a dendrogram of population relatedness (neighbor-joining and/or UPGMA tree).Field sampling: I will locate D. monticola populations throughout the proposed range from Pennsylvania to Georgia. To determine if the Alabama population is truly disjunct, it will be necessary to search for other populations in suitable habitat between Alabama and the southern extent of its range. Topographic maps will be examined to find potential locations of D. monticola populations. For all populations located, I will collect a small amount of tail tissue (less than 10mg) from 20 individuals. Vouchers will be documented using a digital camera. To assist in subsequent population location, GPS coordinates will be recorded for each population. | DNA Extraction and Genetic Analyses: DNA will be extracted using the Promega Wizard Kit (Promega Corporation, Madison). ISSR reactions will be conducted in 25mL volumes using standard methods (Wolfe and Liston 1998). DNA will be electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels, stained using ethidium bromide, and bands will be viewed using ultraviolet light. All ISSR reactions will be replicated to test for the presence or absence of each band. Pictorial documentation of bands will be taken using Kodak EDAS Package, and scoring and sizing of bands will be conducted using Kodak 1D Image Analysis Software Package (Eastman Kodak Corporation, Rochester). Similarity matrices will be constructed and these data will be analyzed using NTSYS (Applied Biostatistics, Inc.) | Interpretation of population data: A network of relatedness between populations will be established based on ISSR analyses. If populations between the southern range of the species and the Alabama population are found, then a continuous range will be indicated and bands will be studied to determine polymorphism, and presence of band subsets. If the Alabama population is disjunct, then it will be possible to examine its position in the resulting dendrogram. A basal position may indicate it is ancestral. However, if it is clustered with the Appalachian populations, I will conclude it is a more recently derived population. In addition to cluster analyses, careful inspection of the ISSR bands lend insights into the origin of this population. For example, a shared subset of bands found in the Appalachian populations would indicate a recently derived population. A high proportion of unique bands may indicate a more ancestral population, as sufficient time has passed for the accumulation of mutations (Soltis and Bloom 1991). Study_Sampling_Frequency: Samples will be taken over a period of approximately two weeks.",/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"/eml:eml/*/abstract"

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years. This will be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental gradients and natural disturbance regimes. The result will be a more complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences that cascade through ecosystems.

The objective for the 2002-2008 research is to advance scientific understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years. This will be accomplished by addressing ecological and socioeconomic aspects of land-use change while continuing long-term studies of environmental gradients and natural disturbance regimes. The result will be a more complete understanding of ecological dynamics in the southern Appalachian Mountains that makes possible the development of reasonable forecasts of its future ecological state. | The guiding hypothesis for the proposed research is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to socioeconomic and bio-geophysical conditions with consequences that cascade through ecosystems.

LTER_2005,EML,00099-metadata.xml,Process Step,"SAMPLING BACKGROUNDThe forest floor was first sampled in 1969-70. Hydrology has been monitored since 1963, and stream water chemistry has been monitored since 1963. The watershed is forested by typical northern hardwood species (sugar maple, beech and yellow birch) on the lower 90 % of its area and by a montane boreal transition forest of red spruce, balsam fir and white birch on the highest 10%. Surveying techniques were used in 1965 to install a grid system of 208 grid cells, each 25 x 25 m square. These grid units serve as the coordinate system for sample plot selection. For more spatial information please visit the following links: http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/maps/w6_zones.htm and http://www.hubbardbrook.org/watersheds/w6_grid_elevations.htm.Sampling was initiated in 1969-1970, repeated in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1982 and at 5 year intervals after that. These data were collected in the summer of 1977. Repeated sampling at 5 year intervals is anticipated to continue.SAMPLING DESIGNEach row of the Watershed 6 grid system of 25 x 25 m cells was considered a stratified sampling set and one or more cells was randomly chosen from these lines as cells to be sampled. Some rows are short, with only 1 to 4 cells, and others are longer, up to 10 cells across. The longer rows may have 2 or 3 cells sampled. The short rows may not have any cells sampled. The location of the sampling plot within each cell was selected by an x-y random number system and the location determined by pacing in to the selected coordinates from the corner of the 25 x 25 m cell. 58 of the 208 cells were sampled in 1977.FIELD COLLECTION PROCEDURESOnce a sampling point was located by pacing, a 15 x 15 cm wooden template was placed on the forest floor and 4 nails were placed through pre-drilled holes, one on each corner. This served to hold the template in place on the forest floor and retain the forest floor material within the sample area beneath the template. A keyhole saw, clippers and a trowel were used to make a clean cut around the template, thus isolating a block of forest floor. The surrounding forest floor material was scraped back from the block leaving it as a pedestal. This block was then undercut in the mineral soil with a saw or trowel to sever any roots. Using a trowel slid beneath the block and our hands on top, the block was carefully picked up and turned over such as to rest on the wooden template. Any remaining mineral soil was carefully scraped away 'up' to the bottom of the Oa layer of the forest floor. After all such mineral soil was removed, the thickness of the block was measured at the highest and lowest point on each of the 4 sides (8 measurements). The block was then placed in total in a plastic bag for return to the laboratory. (Note that in some years the forest floor was divided into sub layers --Oi, Oe, Oa or combinations of these. In 1977 the whole of the forest floor was collected undivided).NOTESThe primary objectives of the forest floor samplings in 1976-1978 were 1) the determination of the amount of lead(Pb) in the forest floor, 2) monitoring the total mass of the forest floor over time and 3) development of a field collection methodology which was efficient and easily implemented. It was determined that separation of the forest floor at least into Oie and Oa, would have been better than no separation whatsoever, so this procedure was implemented from 1987 onwards. It was also determined that air drying the Oa would have been preferable to oven drying. Air drying makes possible the determination of exchangeable nutrients, whereas oven drying alters the cation exchange complex. Air drying of the Oa was implemented from 1992 onwards.LABORATORY PROCEDURESThe forest floor mass was oven dried at 80 oC to a constant weight, then sieved through a 2 mm screen. Sticks (fresh solid woody debris) and roots (live) larger than 2-3 mm in diameter were removed and weighed separately. Material remaining on the sieve (usually bits of bark, solid seeds, bits of hard soil, wood bits and small stones) was then divided into 'sinkers' and 'floaters' by testing it in water. These components ('sinkers' and 'floaters') were separated and again dried and weighed. The objective was to separate the stones from the wood and roots (organic matter) left on the screen. Material passing through the screen was weighed to determine the total weight of the sample, then ground in a Wiley mill to pass a 2 mm screen. Samples of the ground forest floor were put in 4 oz. glass jars for long term preservation in the Hubbard Brook archives.For determination of organic content and chemical analysis, a 2.0 g sample of the oven dry ground material was placed in a pre-weighed crucible and ashed overnight at 450 oC. The ashed material was cooled and weighed. The ash was eluted with 10 ml of 6N HNO3 and heated for a few minutes (to a simmer) on a hot plate. The hot extract solution was poured into a filter paper in a funnel and into a 50 ml volumetric flask. The crucible and the material on the filter paper were rinsed several times with distilled deionized water. Following these several rinsing, the volume in the flask was brought up to 50 ml with the distilled deionized water. The 50 ml of extract solution was then placed in 120 ml plastic bottles for storage until chemical analysis. The elements Zn, Pb and Cu were determined for each sample using an AA spectrophotometer.In 1995, a 0.5 g sample of oven dry ground material from each jar was ashed and eluted by the method described above. The elements Ca and Mg were determined for each sample using an ICP spectrometer. Carbon and nitrogen were determined using oven dried ground material on a CHN analyzer- C and N data are not yet available. These elements are being analyzed by Steve Hamburg at Brown University.CALCULATIONSConcentrations of elements in the forest floor were calculated on an oven dry weight basis. Total amounts of the elements were estimated on a per square meter basis by extrapolating up from the 15 x 15 cm sample mass.
