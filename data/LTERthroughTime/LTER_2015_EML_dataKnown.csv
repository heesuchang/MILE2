Sampling Description: Triplicate porewater diffusion samplers are permanently installed in control plots on the marsh platform in a Spartina alterniflora-dominated salt marsh in North Inlet, SC. Each sampler collects porewater from depths of 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 cm. Samples are retrieved monthly. Porewater samples are either filtered (0.45 uM) and preserved with HCl (for PO4 and NH4) or preserved unfiltered with ZnAc (for sulfides) either in the field or immediately upon return from the field. Porewater collection began in Jan 1994. Lab Methods: Filtered porewater samples are analyzed for PO4, NH4, and chloride concentrations according to standard laboratory protocols (Strickland and Parson 1972). Unfiltered, preserved porewater samples are analyzed for sulfide (Cline 1969). Numerical Processing: Data are reported as geometric means of sample concentrations from 3 depths within the root zone (10, 25, and 50 cm), and the 95% confidence interval, for 3 replicate samplers (n=9 per time). Statistics were computed using SAS (SAS System for Windows; release 8.02; SAS Institute, Inc; Cary, NC)."

The Goat Island sites are accessible from Clambank Rd. about 1/2mile south of Clambank Landing. A board walk connects the high marsh siteand the low marsh site. The North Inlet Estuary is located onthe southeastern coast of the United States, approximately 10 kilometers east of Georgetown, South Carolina. The North Inlet Estuary lies east of the uplands of Hobcaw Barony (also known as the Belle W. Baruch Property). To the north of the Estuary is the Debordieu Colony Property. North Inlet Estuary is a bar-built Class C type estuary (Pritchard, 1955) and is arelatively small tidal estuary (area = 2630 hectares). It is composed of numerous winding tidal creeks dominated bySpartina alterniflora and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts. The watershed drains a 24.8 square kilometer area of mostly pine forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north. -79.198208 -79.198208 33.331659 33.331659"

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) contains human population (total) measurements in number units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Florida Coastal Everglades and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00002-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This LTER Remote Sensing spatial raster dataset consists of LEDAPS corrected Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data for Harvard Forest LTER, originally collected on 2008-07-30 (15:19:16.6430500Z) by Landsat 5, row 30, path 13. Cloud cover was 23.25 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

00003-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Shortgrass Steppe (SGS) contains soil temperature at 5 cm depth (mean) measurements in celsius units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Please read and agree to the data policy of Shortgrass Steppe and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Please read and agree to the data policy of Shortgrass Steppe and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Luquillo Experimental Forest (LUQ) contains chloride in wet deposition measurements in kilogramsPerHectare units and were aggregated to a monthly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes.

This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00006-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This LTER Remote Sensing spatial raster dataset consists of LEDAPS corrected Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data for Baltimore Ecosystem Study, originally collected on 1987-03-29 (15:08:49.9530690Z) by Landsat 5, row 33, path 15. Cloud cover was 10 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

Cloud cover was 14.11 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The complete description is published as a PDF file and this report discusses the LEDAPS algorithm implemented by the USGS.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Santee Experimental Forest (SAN) contains human population density measurements in numberPerKilometerSquared units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon).

The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

Cloud cover was 0 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) contains plant biomass measurements in gramsPerSquareMeter units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use.

Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema.

Cloud cover was 0 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

00018-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Santa Barbara Coastal (SBC) contains animal density of Cymatogaster aggregata measurements in numberPerMeterSquared units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Please read and agree to the data policy of Santa Barbara Coastal and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Please read and agree to the data policy of Santa Barbara Coastal and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00020-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (CDR) contains animal abundance of Ageneotettix deorum measurements in numberPer200Sweeps units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Cloud cover was 4.69 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The complete description is published as a PDF file and this report discusses the LEDAPS algorithm implemented by the USGS. After conversion,each scene is packaged in a compressed tar file (*.tar.gz), which includes:surface reflectance (lndsr.*.hdf), top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (lndcal.*.hdf), and thermal brightness temperature (lndth.*.hdf). The data is organized by LTER site in the same manner as the original source data. Contributors on this project include LTER scientists Tom Spies (PI), Zhiqiang Yang and Peder Nelson(programming and technical support), Theresa Valentine (logistics and coordination with LNO), Margaret O'Brien (EML support), Kyle Cavanaugh (technical advice), and LNO staff (John Vande Castle, Mark Servilla, and Duane Costa) for technical advice, EML generation, and PASTA integration.

The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The complete description is published as a PDF file and this report discusses the LEDAPS algorithm implemented by the USGS. After conversion,each scene is packaged in a compressed tar file (*.tar.gz), which includes:surface reflectance (lndsr.*.hdf), top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (lndcal.*.hdf), and thermal brightness temperature (lndth.*.hdf). The data is organized by LTER site in the same manner as the original source data. Contributors on this project include LTER scientists Tom Spies (PI), Zhiqiang Yang and Peder Nelson(programming and technical support), Theresa Valentine (logistics and coordination with LNO), Margaret O'Brien (EML support), Kyle Cavanaugh (technical advice), and LNO staff (John Vande Castle, Mark Servilla, and Duane Costa) for technical advice, EML generation, and PASTA integration.

The original Landsat data were downloaded from http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov. These data are Landsat image band files that have been corrected using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) Algorithm and are stored in HDF format. The Landsat standard data products used in this dataset were processed using the Level 1 Product Generation System (LPGS) with the following parameters applied: GeoTIFF output format Cubic Convolution (CC) resampling method 30-meter (TM, ETM+) and 60-meter (MSS) pixel size (reflective bands) Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection (Polar Stereographic projection for Antarctica) World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 datum MAP (North-up) image orientation About the Landsat Thematic Mapper 'The Thematic Mapper (TM) is an advanced, multispectral scanning, Earth resources sensor designed to achieve higher image resolution, sharper spectral separation, improved geometric fidelity and greater radiometric accuracy and resolution than the MSS sensor. TM data are sensed in seven spectral bands simultaneously. Band 6 senses thermal (heat) infrared radiation. Landsat can only acquire night scenes in band 6.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The complete description is published as a PDF file and this report discusses the LEDAPS algorithm implemented by the USGS. After conversion,each scene is packaged in a compressed tar file (*.tar.gz), which includes:surface reflectance (lndsr.*.hdf), top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (lndcal.*.hdf), and thermal brightness temperature (lndth.*.hdf).

00024-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"In August 2012, soil samples were collected from control, and N+P plots from within a set of treatments in Moist Acidic Tundra plots established in 2006. At the time of sample collection we separated the soil into organic horizon, organic/mineral interface, and the upper 5cm of the mineral soil, and measured the depth of each layer. We determined percent moisture for all soils and quantified protozoa and nematode the biomass. Protozoa densities were estimated from 10 g soil samples using Most Probable Number MPN (Darbyshire et al. 1974; Ingham 1994). 10 g soil was serially diluted 10-1-10-6. Using a 24-well tissue culture plate, four replicate wells of each of the six dilutions were created by adding 0.5 ml soil solution to the wells (Rusterholz and Mallory 1994). E. coli, a bacterium food source for protozoa was added to each of the wells. Protozoa were separated into the broad categories of Amoebae, Flagellates and Ciliates. Nematodes were isolated from 20 g of soil samples using Baermann Funnels (Hall 1996). Nematodes were preserved in formalin, counted and identified to functional group based on the morphology of the stoma and stylet (Niles 1994). Rotifers, Tardigrades, and Enchytraeids were isolated from 5 g of soil using the methods of Peters et al. (1993). References Darbyshire, J. F., R. F. Wheatley, M. P. Greaves, and R. H. E.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

00025-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) contains water temperature (mean maximum) measurements in celsius units and were aggregated to a monthly timescale."

EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Florida Coastal Everglades and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

Cloud cover was 0 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project.

00027-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"E172 is an herbivory experiment established by Dave Tilman in fall 2004 by enclosing in deer fences three randomly selected plots from the six replicates of each control and each treatment in the N addition E001 experiment in field C. These plots still receive the nutrient treatments prescribed in the Experiment 001 protocols. From 1982-2004 a fence containing all of e001 plots in Field C was designed to exclude deer and all small mammals, including mice, voles and pocket gophers. This fence was removed in Fall of 2004 and individual plots designated for e172 were enclosed in deer fences. The purpose of E001 was to measure how adding nitrogen over a long time would affect the number of species, the type of species present, the amount of annual growth, and the change from year to year in the growth of each species in a plant community which is also relieved of grazing by large and small mammals. There are 8 different levels of nitrogen addition with other nutrients added to ensure that nitrogen remains the limiting nutrient, and a control which receives no nutrients. The plots are in a 6 by 9 grid and are 4 by 4 meters in size with 1 meter aisles between plots. Nitrogen fertilizer (NH4NO3) is applied twice per year, once in early May and once in late June."

00027-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"'Microplot' Fertilization Treatments The 'microplot' fertilization treatments are used in experiments 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 11, 23, 25, and 52. Experiments 5, 6, 28, 36, 53, 97, 98, 100 and 172 are conducted within plots that are fertilized and should be treated as part of the fertilized plot. There are nine treatment levels, assigned a numeric label 1 to 9. This is also equivalent to the letters A through I. Treatment levels 1 through 8 differ in the amount of NH4NO3 added. Treatment 9 is a true control and receives no nutrients. The nutrients are applied twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. An exception is experiment 25 where time of application is experimentally manipulated. Not all experiments use all possible treatments. Nutrients are given in g/m2 for each fertilization; plot area and treatments used follow the nutrient lists. Treatment 1 to 8 receive the following base nutrients: @@ Rate Volume Element 10 g/m2 150 ml P2O5 (0-46-0) 10 g/m2 150 ml K2O (0-0-61) 20 g/m2 200 ml CaCO3 (lime) 15m2 200 ml MgSO4 (Epsom Salts) 0.0625 ml/m2 trace mineral solution in 1 ml to 10 ml sand@@ The amount of NH4NO3 fertilizer added at the different treatment levels is: @@ Treatment Rate Volume 1 0.0 g/m2 0 ml 2 1.5 g/m2 25 ml 3 3.0 g/m2 50 ml 4 5.0 g/m2 90 ml 5 8.0 g/m2 140 ml 6 14.0 g/m2 250 ml 7 25.0 g/m2 445 ml 8 40.0 g/m2 710 ml 9 0.0 g/m2 0 ml@@ Fertilizer is mixed and spread by hand twice a year, once in early May and once in late June. Each plot gets the fertilizer mixture specified by its fertilizer treatment code. These rates are added twice a year. Actual annual N addition is calculated as: 0.34%N * rate (g/m2) * 2 times/year The trace mineral stock solutions are made by adding the following grams of reagent to 1000 ml of water: CuSO4*5H2O 9.8 g ZnSO4*7H2O 22.0 g or ZnCl2 10.5 g CoCl2*6H2O 10.0 g MnCl2*4H2O 180.0 g Na2MoO4*2H2O 6.3 g H3BO3 6.0 g The trace metal solution is made by combining 120ml of each stock solution, adding 67.2g of citric acid dissolved in deionized water and adding deionized water to bring the volume to a total of 2 liters. The working solution is then autoclaved to chelate the trace metals. Some changes and/or additions occur from year to year for some experiments. These changes are listed below. Unless specific experiments are mentioned, these differences apply to all experiments in a category. In 1982, 30ml of each stock solution was combined with 16.8g citric acid, brought to a total volume of 1 liter, and autoclaved to dissolve. 1.5ml of this solution was added to 30ml of silica sand, mixed and dried. In 1983, 60ml of each stock solution was combined with 25g of EDTA brought to 1 liter, and autoclaved to dissolve. 1ml of this solution was added to 10ml of sand and added to each plot. In 1984, 60ml of each stock solution was combined with 25g of citric acid and brought to 1 liter. In 1985, the first fertilization for experiments 1 and 2, Treatment F received an extra 23 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 118.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received an extra 132.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, between fertilizations for experiments 1 and 2, Treatment G received 137.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received 206.25 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, the second fertilization for experiments 1 and 2, Treatment F received an extra 23.0 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 252.7 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received an extra 441.1 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, the first fertilization for experiment 4, Treatment E received no CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 45.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1985, both fertilizations for experiments 8, 9, and 11, Treatment F received an extra 23 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment G received an extra 43.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 Treatment H received an extra 57.5 g/m2 of CaCO3 In 1989, lime was added to adjust pH to the following treatments in the spring: Quantities of lime stone (g/plot): Experiment 1 @@ Treatment Field A Field B Field C Field D A 0 0 0 200 B 0 0 320 200 C 0 0 320 200 D 850 320 320 200 E 1000 850 1000 200 F 1300 1200 1900 200 G 1300 320 320 200 H 2100 1600 1000 20 I 0 0 0 0@@ Layout of Plots Plots for this experiment are 4x4 meter squares.

00028-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) contains calcium in wet deposition measurements in kilogramsPerHectare units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Please read and agree to the data policy of Florida Coastal Everglades and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Cloud cover was 14.71 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The complete description is published as a PDF file and this report discusses the LEDAPS algorithm implemented by the USGS. After conversion,each scene is packaged in a compressed tar file (*.tar.gz), which includes:surface reflectance (lndsr.*.hdf), top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (lndcal.*.hdf), and thermal brightness temperature (lndth.*.hdf). The data is organized by LTER site in the same manner as the original source data.

00031-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from North Temperate Lakes (NTL) contains animal abundance of Notropis volucellus measurements in numberPerEffort units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use.

Please read and agree to the data policy of North Temperate Lakes and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character.

Please read and agree to the data policy of North Temperate Lakes and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon).

00033-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Harvard Forest (HFR) contains population employed at farms (percent of total) measurements in percent units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy.

Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Harvard Forest and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00034-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"Data Policies TER Network Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement approved by the LTER Coordinating Committee April 6, 2005 Long Term Ecological Research Network Data Access Policy The LTER data policy includes three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of LTER data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. LTER Network Data Release Policy Data and information derived from publicly funded research in the U.S. LTER Network, totally or partially from LTER funds from NSF, Institutional Cost-Share, or Partner Agency or Institution where a formal memorandum of understanding with LTER has been established, are made available online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. LTER Network scientists should make every effort to release data in a timely fashion and with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data There are two data types: Type I â€“ data are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement (see Section 3 below) within 2 years from collection and no later than the publication of the main findings from the dataset and, Type II - data are to be released to restricted audiences according to terms specified by the owners of the data. Type II data are considered to be exceptional and should be rare in occurrence. The justification for exceptions must be well documented and approved by the lead PI and Site Data Manager. Some examples of Type II data restrictions may include: locations of rare or endangered species, data that are covered under prior licensing or copyright (e.g., SPOT satellite data), or covered by the Human Subjects Act. Researchers that make use of Type II Data may be subject to additional restrictions to protect any applicable commercial or confidentiality interests. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data in either Type I or II status, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Primary observations collected for core research activities directly supported by LTER research must receive the highest priority for data release. Data collected by other sources to which LTER supported research has added value is also a high priority Other types of data including non-LTER data that was acquired for LTER research, student thesis data, schoolyard LTER data, or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. Metadata Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. All metadata will be publicly available regardless of any restrictions on access to the data. All metadata will follow LTER recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. LTER Network Data Access Requirements The access to all LTER data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized across the LTER Network to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement or Restricted Data Use Agreement, as applicable. A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data providers wishing to impose further requirements beyond these are encouraged to include them in their Restricted Data Use Agreements accompanying the datasets. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by LTER sites or the network will be accompanied with a use agreement that specifies the conditions for data use. For Type I data, this shall be the General Data Use Agreement (see appendix II). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. For Type II datasets, a Restricted Data Use Agreement must be provided with the dataset that identifies the specific restrictions on the use of the data and their justification. Because these are expected to be unique to the dataset, no template is provided although in most cases the General Data Use Agreement can be modified to serve. Grounds for restricting data may include the need to restrict access to species, habitats or cultural resources protected by legislation; rights of privacy granted by human subjects legislation; or protection of intellectual, financial or legal rights over the data held by a third party. This policy becomes effective when approved by the LTER Network Coordinating Committee. It may be revised by, or at the request of, the same body. General Data Use Agreement Definitions â€œData Setâ€ â€“ Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. â€œData Userâ€ - individual to whom access has been granted to this Data Set, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Data Set â€œData Set Creatorâ€ - individual or institution that produced the Data Set â€œData Set Ownerâ€ â€“ individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Data Set Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Data Set Creator. â€œData Set Distributorâ€ - individual or institution providing access to the Data Sets. â€œData Set Contactâ€ - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Data Set as the primary contact for the Data Set. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Data Set. Any other uses for the Data Set or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Data Set. The Data User will not redistribute the original Data Set beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Data Set in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Data Set. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. For example: McKee, W. 2001. Vascular plant list on the Andrews Experimental Forest and nearby Research Natural Areas: Long-Term Ecological Research. Corvallis, OR: Forest Science Data Bank: SA002. [Database]. http://www.fsl.orst.edu/lter/data/abstract.cfm?dbcode=SA002. (21 October 2004) 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Data Set contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. For example: Data sets were provided by the Forest Science Data Bank, a partnership between the Department of Forest Science, Oregon State University, and the U.S. Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station, Corvallis, Oregon. Significant funding for collection of these data was provided by the National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research program (NSF Grant numbers BSR-90-11663 and DEB-96-32921). 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Data Set Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Data Set is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Data Set and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Data Set was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Data Set has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Data Set Creator. By accepting this Data Set, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in this Data Set, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available 'as is'. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Data Set harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation."

00035-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This LTER Remote Sensing spatial raster dataset consists of LEDAPS corrected Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data for Sevilleta LTER, originally collected on 2009-03-23 (17:25:36.9490190Z) by Landsat 5, row 036, path 033. Cloud cover was 4.65 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (CDR) contains plant biomass of Hedeoma hispida measurements in gramsPerSquareMeter units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

00036-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists.

00036-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) contains number of farms measurements in number units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement.

00038-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Kellogg Biological Station and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

All Landsat standard data products are processed using the Level 1 Product Generation System (LPGS) with the following parameters applied: GeoTIFF output format Cubic Convolution (CC) resampling method 30-meter (TM, ETM+) and 60-meter (MSS) pixel size (reflective bands) Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection (Polar Stereographic projection for Antarctica) World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 datum MAP (North-up) image orientation Landsat Thematic Mapper 'The Thematic Mapper (TM) is an advanced, multispectral scanning, Earth resources sensor designed to achieve higher image resolution, sharper spectral separation, improved geometric fidelity and greater radiometric accuracy and resolution than the MSS sensor. TM data are sensed in seven spectral bands simultaneously. Band 6 senses thermal (heat) infrared radiation. Landsat can only acquire night scenes in band 6. A TM scene has an Instantaneous Field Of View (IFOV) of 30 square meters in bands 1-5 and 7 while band 6 has an IFOV of 120 square meters on the ground.' from http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/tm.html accessed 2012-01-30 See also the README.txt file listed as other entity.

00041-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Harvard Forest (HFR) contains population employed in commerce (percent of total) measurements in percent units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Harvard Forest and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00042-metadata.xml,Resource Creation/Revision Date,/eml:eml/dataset/pubDate,"2008-01-25"
00042-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"In 2004 the Boundary Fire burned an area within the Caribou Poker Creeks Research Watershed providing an opportunity to study various fire effects. When wildfire burns through a northern black spruce forest there is usually a subsequent increase in depth of thaw, due to the reduction in the depth of the organic layer. The construction of firelines with heavy machinery involves the complete removal of the organic layer and results in an even greater increase in active layer. This study was designed as a long-term comparison between depth of thaw on firelines, burned and unburned black spruce forest underlain by ice rich permafrost. This study will allow us to compare thaw depths from recent firelines to those studied at the Wickersham and Bonanza Creek fireline study sites. Within the fireline bulldozers were used to knock down and in some cases remove, the trees and organic layer. Within the safety zone an area approximately 30 m x 30 m was cleared to mineral soil. After the fire was out an excavator was used to return the organic material to the fireline and safety zones."

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Konza Prairie (KNZ) contains animal abundance of Zapus hudsonius measurements in numberPerTransectLinePer4DayTrapSeason units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Konza Prairie and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00044-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Santa Barbara Coastal (SBC) contains animal cover of Chaceia ovoidea measurements in percent units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Please read and agree to the data policy of Santa Barbara Coastal and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Please read and agree to the data policy of Santa Barbara Coastal and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Sevilleta (SEV) contains animal abundance of Rodentia measurements in numberPerTrappingWeb units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Sevilleta and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00049-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Deployment The MicroCAT was mounted inside a protective PVC pipe enclosure and attached to a wooden piling (~12 inch diameter) that was driven firmly into the substrate. The enclosure was constructed from a 10-foot length of 6-inch (internal diameter) PVC pipe that was perforated all over by drilling 1.5-inch holes (at approximately 4-inch spacing); this permits proper water circulation within the enclosure. The bottom of the PVC pipe was submerged about 5 feet below the water surface at low tide and bolted (vertically) to the piling. The MicroCAT was deployed by lowering it into the enclosure on a 0.375-inch stainless steel cable, and bolting the cable to the piling, so that the bottom of the data logger was ~3 inches above the bottom of the PVC pipe. A weighted surveyor's tape was then used to measure the distance from the substrate to the pressure sensor on the MicroCAT for calculation of total water column depth from pressure readings. The mooring was inspected every 1-3 weeks, and any visible fouling of the enclosure or MicroCAT was removed with a brush or scraper.

The stored data was uploaded using a RS-232 serial cable and Sea-Bird Electronics SEATERM software. The MicroCAT was then cleaned to remove encrusting material and calibrated with a reference instrument at 4 to 5 salinity levels, generally ranging from 30 to 5 PSU. Data Processing Data were processed after each retrieval using custom programs in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (parse_37sm and imp_gcesonde). Depth was calculated from recorded pressure and latitude values, and salinity and sigma-t were calculated from recorded conductivity and temperature values using standard UNESCO algorithms (reference: Unesco. 1983. Algorithms for computation of fundamental properties of seawater, 1983. Unesco Technical Papers in Marine Science No. 44, 53 pp.). Data were then plotted and visually inspected for evidence of biofouling of the conductivity sensor (i.e. prolonged periods of damped tidal oscillation in conductivity signal with no corresponding changes in temperature signal and no wind or rainfall events recorded at nearby monitoring stations, or periods of damped oscillation immediately followed by normal oscillation after instrument maintenance or replacement). Conductivity values recorded during periods of suspected biofouling were flagged as I (invalid) if visible fouling was noted in maintenance logs, and Q (questionable) if no visible fouling was noted. 2003-01-01 2003-12-31 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. Altamaha River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -4km to 40km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.582311 -81.237936 31.401403 31.296034 Continuous CTD Measurement Conductivity, temperature and pressure were measured at 30 minute intervals using a hydrographic sonde deployed at GCE-LTER sampling location GCE9_Hydro (Altamaha River hydrographic datalogger deployment near Rockdedundy Island). The sonde was moored to a wooden piling and submerged 1-1.5m below mean low water. The MicroCAT was programmed to autonomously measure and log conductivity, temperature and pressure at a sampling rate of 30 minutes (based on its internal chronometer). Upon retrieval the data was downloaded from the instrument via RS-232 serial communications and processed using custom Matlab(r) procedures to calculate depth (i.e. from pressure and latitude), salinity and sigma-t (i.e. from conductivity and temperature), and date and time components from sample time stamps.

00049-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Deployment The MicroCAT was mounted inside a protective PVC pipe enclosure and attached to a wooden piling (~12 inch diameter) that was driven firmly into the substrate. The enclosure was constructed from a 10-foot length of 6-inch (internal diameter) PVC pipe that was perforated all over by drilling 1.5-inch holes (at approximately 4-inch spacing); this permits proper water circulation within the enclosure. The bottom of the PVC pipe was submerged about 5 feet below the water surface at low tide and bolted (vertically) to the piling. The MicroCAT was deployed by lowering it into the enclosure on a 0.375-inch stainless steel cable, and bolting the cable to the piling, so that the bottom of the data logger was ~3 inches above the bottom of the PVC pipe. A weighted surveyor's tape was then used to measure the distance from the substrate to the pressure sensor on the MicroCAT for calculation of total water column depth from pressure readings. The mooring was inspected every 1-3 weeks, and any visible fouling of the enclosure or MicroCAT was removed with a brush or scraper.

The stored data was uploaded using a RS-232 serial cable and Sea-Bird Electronics SEATERM software. The MicroCAT was then cleaned to remove encrusting material and calibrated with a reference instrument at 4 to 5 salinity levels, generally ranging from 30 to 5 PSU. Data Processing Data were processed after each retrieval using custom programs in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (parse_37sm and imp_gcesonde). Depth was calculated from recorded pressure and latitude values, and salinity and sigma-t were calculated from recorded conductivity and temperature values using standard UNESCO algorithms (reference: Unesco. 1983. Algorithms for computation of fundamental properties of seawater, 1983. Unesco Technical Papers in Marine Science No. 44, 53 pp.). Data were then plotted and visually inspected for evidence of biofouling of the conductivity sensor (i.e. prolonged periods of damped tidal oscillation in conductivity signal with no corresponding changes in temperature signal and no wind or rainfall events recorded at nearby monitoring stations, or periods of damped oscillation immediately followed by normal oscillation after instrument maintenance or replacement). Conductivity values recorded during periods of suspected biofouling were flagged as I (invalid) if visible fouling was noted in maintenance logs, and Q (questionable) if no visible fouling was noted. 2003-01-01 2003-12-31 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. Altamaha River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -4km to 40km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.582311 -81.237936 31.401403 31.296034 Continuous CTD Measurement Conductivity, temperature and pressure were measured at 30 minute intervals using a hydrographic sonde deployed at GCE-LTER sampling location GCE9_Hydro (Altamaha River hydrographic datalogger deployment near Rockdedundy Island). The sonde was moored to a wooden piling and submerged 1-1.5m below mean low water. The MicroCAT was programmed to autonomously measure and log conductivity, temperature and pressure at a sampling rate of 30 minutes (based on its internal chronometer). Upon retrieval the data was downloaded from the instrument via RS-232 serial communications and processed using custom Matlab(r) procedures to calculate depth (i.e. from pressure and latitude), salinity and sigma-t (i.e. from conductivity and temperature), and date and time components from sample time stamps.

Pennings principalInvestigator Wade M. Sheldon informationManager We propose to establish a Long Term Ecological Research site on the central Georgia coast in the vicinity of Sapelo Island. This is a barrier island and marsh complex with the Altamaha River, one of the largest and least developed rivers on the east coast of the US, as the primary source of fresh water. The proposed study would investigate the linkages between local and distant upland areas mediated by water - surface water and ground water - delivery to the coastal zone. We would explicitly examine the relationship between variability in environmental factors driven by river flow, primarily salinity because we can measure it at high frequency, and ecosystem processes and structure. We will accomplish this by comparing estuary/marsh complexes separated from the Altamaha River by one or two lagoonal estuary/marsh complexes that damp and attenuate the river signal. This spatial gradient is analogous to the temporal trend in riverine influence expected as a result of development in the watershed. We will implement a monitoring system that documents physical and biological variables and use the time trends and spatial distributions of these variables and of their variance structure to address questions about the factors controlling distributions, trophic structure, diversity, and biogeochemistry. An existing GIS-based hydrologic model will be modified to incorporate changes in river water resulting from changes in land use patterns that can be expected as the watershed develops. This model will be linked to ecosystem models and will serve as an heuristic and management tool. Another consequence of coastal development is that as river flow decreases, groundwater flow increases and becomes nutrified. We will compare the effects of ground water discharge from the surficial aquifer in relatively pristine (Sapelo Island) versus more urbanized (mainland) sites to assess the relative importance of fresh water versus nutrients to productivity, structure and biomass turnover rate in marshes influenced by groundwater. We will also investigate the effect of marine processes (tides, storm surge) on mixing across the fresh/salt interface in the surficial aquifer. Additional physical studies will relate the morphology of salt marsh - tidal creek channel complexes to tidal current distributions and exchange. These findings will be incorporated into a physical model that will be coupled to an existing ecosystem model. The land/ocean margin ecosystem lies at the interface between two ecosystems in which distinctly different groups of decomposers control organic matter degradation. The terrestrial ecosystem is largely dominated by fungal decomposers, while bacterial decomposers dominate the marine ecosystem. Both groups are important in salt marsh-dominated ecosystems. Specific studies will examine, at the level of individual cells and hyphae, the relationship bacteria and fungi in the consortia that decompose standing dead Spartina and other marsh plants and examine how, or if, this changes along the salinity gradient.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Blacks Mountain Experimental Forest (BLA) contains sulfur from sulfate in wet deposition measurements in kilogramsPerHectare units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

00051-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset.

00051-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon).

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Harrison Experimental Forest (HAR) contains number of farms measurements in number units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements.

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Harrison Experimental Forest and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

Cloud cover was 30 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The complete description is published as a PDF file and this report discusses the LEDAPS algorithm implemented by the USGS. After conversion,each scene is packaged in a compressed tar file (*.tar.gz), which includes:surface reflectance (lndsr.*.hdf), top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (lndcal.*.hdf), and thermal brightness temperature (lndth.*.hdf).

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) contains aboveground net primary productivity of Crataegus measurements in gramsPerMeterSquaredPerYear units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Kellogg Biological Station and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00055-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Deployment The MicroCAT was mounted inside a protective PVC pipe enclosure and attached to a wooden piling (~12 inch diameter) that was driven firmly into the substrate. The enclosure was constructed from a 10-foot length of 6-inch (internal diameter) PVC pipe that was perforated all over by drilling 1.5-inch holes (at approximately 4-inch spacing); this permits proper water circulation within the enclosure. The bottom of the PVC pipe was submerged about 5 feet below the water surface at low tide and bolted (vertically) to the piling. The MicroCAT was deployed by lowering it into the enclosure on a 0.375-inch stainless steel cable, and bolting the cable to the piling, so that the bottom of the data logger was ~3 inches above the bottom of the PVC pipe. A weighted surveyor's tape was then used to measure the distance from the substrate to the pressure sensor on the MicroCAT for calculation of total water column depth from pressure readings. The mooring was inspected every 1-3 weeks, and any visible fouling of the enclosure or MicroCAT was removed with a brush or scaper.

The stored data was uploaded to a computer using a RS-232 serial cable and Sea-Bird Electronics SEATERM software. The MicroCAT was then cleaned to remove encrusting material and calibrated with a reference instrument at 4 to 5 salinity levels, generally ranging from 30 to 5 PSU. Data Processing Data were processed after each retrieval using custom programs in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (parse_37sm and imp_gcesonde). Depth was calculated from recorded pressure and latitude values, and salinity and sigma-t were calculated from recorded conductivity and temperature values using standard UNESCO algorithms (reference: Unesco. 1983. Algorithms for computation of fundamental properties of seawater, 1983. Unesco Technical Papers in Marine Science No. 44, 53 pp.). Data were then plotted and visually inspected for evidence of biofouling of the conductivity sensor (i.e. prolonged periods of damped tidal oscillation in conductivity signal with no corresponding changes in temperature signal and no wind or rainfall events recorded at nearby monitoring stations, or periods of damped oscillation immediately followed by normal oscillation after instrument maintenance or replacement). Conductivity values recorded during periods of suspected biofouling were flagged as I (invalid) if visible fouling was noted in maintenance logs, and Q (questionable) if no visible fouling was noted. Daily Aggregation The finalized 30-minute resolution data set was filtered to remove any remaining invalid values (i.e. assigned qualifier flags of 'I' = invalid value or 'X' = excise row), then padded with empty rows to produce a monotonic time series data set with even time steps. The data records were then aggregated (grouped) by Year, Month, Day, Site, Longitude and Latitude, and relevant summary statistics were calculated for each measured variable in each group and added as data columns. Quality control rules were defined for each calculated column to flag statistics based on days with more than 35% missing values as invalid, and more than 10% missing values or 35% flagged values as questionable. Columns listing the number and percentage of missing and flagged values in the original data set for each day were also added as data columns for reference by quality control rules. Following aggregation, summary statistics flagged as invalid were removed from the daily-aggregated data set and converted to missing (NaN). 2010-01-01 2010-12-31 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. Altamaha River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -4km to 40km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.582311 -81.237936 31.401403 31.296034 Research Study Conductivity, temperature and pressure were continuously monitored using an autonomous data-logging sensor package (sonde) that was moored to a piling and submerged 1-1.5m below mean low water. The MicroCAT was programmed to autonomously measure and log conductivity, temperature and pressure at a sampling rate of 30 minutes (based on its internal chronometer). Upon retrieval the data was downloaded from the instrument via RS-232 serial communications and processed using custom Matlab(r) procedures to calculate depth (i.e. from pressure and latitude), salinity and sigma-t (i.e. from conductivity and temperature), and date and time components from sample time stamps.

00055-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Deployment The MicroCAT was mounted inside a protective PVC pipe enclosure and attached to a wooden piling (~12 inch diameter) that was driven firmly into the substrate. The enclosure was constructed from a 10-foot length of 6-inch (internal diameter) PVC pipe that was perforated all over by drilling 1.5-inch holes (at approximately 4-inch spacing); this permits proper water circulation within the enclosure. The bottom of the PVC pipe was submerged about 5 feet below the water surface at low tide and bolted (vertically) to the piling. The MicroCAT was deployed by lowering it into the enclosure on a 0.375-inch stainless steel cable, and bolting the cable to the piling, so that the bottom of the data logger was ~3 inches above the bottom of the PVC pipe. A weighted surveyor's tape was then used to measure the distance from the substrate to the pressure sensor on the MicroCAT for calculation of total water column depth from pressure readings. The mooring was inspected every 1-3 weeks, and any visible fouling of the enclosure or MicroCAT was removed with a brush or scaper.

The stored data was uploaded to a computer using a RS-232 serial cable and Sea-Bird Electronics SEATERM software. The MicroCAT was then cleaned to remove encrusting material and calibrated with a reference instrument at 4 to 5 salinity levels, generally ranging from 30 to 5 PSU. Data Processing Data were processed after each retrieval using custom programs in the GCE Data Toolbox for MATLAB (parse_37sm and imp_gcesonde). Depth was calculated from recorded pressure and latitude values, and salinity and sigma-t were calculated from recorded conductivity and temperature values using standard UNESCO algorithms (reference: Unesco. 1983. Algorithms for computation of fundamental properties of seawater, 1983. Unesco Technical Papers in Marine Science No. 44, 53 pp.). Data were then plotted and visually inspected for evidence of biofouling of the conductivity sensor (i.e. prolonged periods of damped tidal oscillation in conductivity signal with no corresponding changes in temperature signal and no wind or rainfall events recorded at nearby monitoring stations, or periods of damped oscillation immediately followed by normal oscillation after instrument maintenance or replacement). Conductivity values recorded during periods of suspected biofouling were flagged as I (invalid) if visible fouling was noted in maintenance logs, and Q (questionable) if no visible fouling was noted. Daily Aggregation The finalized 30-minute resolution data set was filtered to remove any remaining invalid values (i.e. assigned qualifier flags of 'I' = invalid value or 'X' = excise row), then padded with empty rows to produce a monotonic time series data set with even time steps. The data records were then aggregated (grouped) by Year, Month, Day, Site, Longitude and Latitude, and relevant summary statistics were calculated for each measured variable in each group and added as data columns. Quality control rules were defined for each calculated column to flag statistics based on days with more than 35% missing values as invalid, and more than 10% missing values or 35% flagged values as questionable. Columns listing the number and percentage of missing and flagged values in the original data set for each day were also added as data columns for reference by quality control rules. Following aggregation, summary statistics flagged as invalid were removed from the daily-aggregated data set and converted to missing (NaN). 2010-01-01 2010-12-31 GCE Study Site GCE-AL -- Altamaha River, Georgia, USA. Altamaha River transect used for GCE quarterly hydrographic monitoring surveys. Nominal profiling stations are defined every 2km from -4km to 40km (relative to station 0km at the line of demarcation), based on an estimated Thalweg line running up the main river channel. -81.582311 -81.237936 31.401403 31.296034 Research Study Conductivity, temperature and pressure were continuously monitored using an autonomous data-logging sensor package (sonde) that was moored to a piling and submerged 1-1.5m below mean low water. The MicroCAT was programmed to autonomously measure and log conductivity, temperature and pressure at a sampling rate of 30 minutes (based on its internal chronometer). Upon retrieval the data was downloaded from the instrument via RS-232 serial communications and processed using custom Matlab(r) procedures to calculate depth (i.e. from pressure and latitude), salinity and sigma-t (i.e. from conductivity and temperature), and date and time components from sample time stamps.

Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER program, located on the central Georgia coast, was established in 2000. The study domain encompasses three adjacent sounds (Altamaha, Doboy, Sapelo) and includes upland (mainland, barrier islands, marsh hammocks), intertidal (fresh, brackish and salt marsh) and submerged (river, estuary, continental shelf) habitats. Patterns and processes in this complex landscape vary spatially within and between sites, and temporally on multiple scales (tidal, diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Overlain on this spatial and temporal variation are long-term trends caused by climate change, sea level rise, and human alterations of the landscape. These long-term trends are likely to manifest in many ways, including changes in water quality, river discharge, runoff and tidal inundation patterns throughout the estuarine landscape. The overarching goal of the GCE program is to understand the mechanisms by which variation in the quality, source and amount of both fresh and salt water create temporal and spatial variability in estuarine habitats and processes, in order to predict directional changes that will occur in response to long-term shifts in estuarine salinity patterns. The objectives of the current funding cycle are 1) to continue to document long-term patterns of environmental forcing to the coastal zone, 2) to link environmental forcing to observed spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical processes, primary production, community dynamics, decomposition and disturbance, 3) to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which environmental gradients along the longitudinal (freshwater-saltwater) and 4) lateral (upland-subtidal) axes of estuaries drive ecosystem change, and 5) to explore the relative importance of larval transport and the conditions of the adult environment in determining community and genetic structure across both the longitudinal and vertical gradients of the estuary. To meet these objectives, we utilize a suite of approaches including long-term monitoring of abiotic drivers and ecosystem responses; manipulative and natural experiments designed to enable us to examine the importance of key ecosystem drivers; and modeling.

The study domain encompasses three adjacent sounds (Altamaha, Doboy, Sapelo) and includes upland (mainland, barrier islands, marsh hammocks), intertidal (fresh, brackish and salt marsh) and submerged (river, estuary, continental shelf) habitats. Patterns and processes in this complex landscape vary spatially within and between sites, and temporally on multiple scales (tidal, diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Overlain on this spatial and temporal variation are long-term trends caused by climate change, sea level rise, and human alterations of the landscape. These long-term trends are likely to manifest in many ways, including changes in water quality, river discharge, runoff and tidal inundation patterns throughout the estuarine landscape. The overarching goal of the GCE program is to understand the mechanisms by which variation in the quality, source and amount of both fresh and salt water create temporal and spatial variability in estuarine habitats and processes, in order to predict directional changes that will occur in response to long-term shifts in estuarine salinity patterns. The objectives of the current funding cycle are 1) to continue to document long-term patterns of environmental forcing to the coastal zone, 2) to link environmental forcing to observed spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical processes, primary production, community dynamics, decomposition and disturbance, 3) to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which environmental gradients along the longitudinal (freshwater-saltwater) and 4) lateral (upland-subtidal) axes of estuaries drive ecosystem change, and 5) to explore the relative importance of larval transport and the conditions of the adult environment in determining community and genetic structure across both the longitudinal and vertical gradients of the estuary. To meet these objectives, we utilize a suite of approaches including long-term monitoring of abiotic drivers and ecosystem responses; manipulative and natural experiments designed to enable us to examine the importance of key ecosystem drivers; and modeling.

Cloud cover was 20 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record. The complete description is published as a PDF file and this report discusses the LEDAPS algorithm implemented by the USGS.

The current interdisciplinary research integrates ecological and socioeconomic components across 54,000 km2 of the southern Appalachian Mountains, a biogeophysical and socioeconomic region in which evolutionary and historical processes converge (Whittaker 1956, Markusen 1987, Barnes 1991, Kretzschmar et al. 1993, Bailey 1996). Our research objective in 2002-2008 is to advance scientific understanding of the spatial, temporal, and decision-making components of land use and land-use change in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last 200 years, and forecast patterns into the future 30 years. Our guiding hypothesis is that the frequency, intensity, and extent of land use represents human decision-making in response to socioeconomic and biogeophysical conditions with consequences that cascade through ecosystems.

N and P fertilizer is applied in 3 monthly doses beginning just before leaf-out in late May each year. N and P fertilizer applications have continued since initiation in 1997 and 2004, respectively. Methods FIELD: In 2009, ten leaves were sampled from each of 5 randomly selected alders in each control, N-fertilized, and P-fertilized plot in replicated early, mid, and late successional stages during the peak growing season (first week of July) and just before leaf fall (third week of September). For each plant, the first fully-mature leaf from 10 branches was removed, these were stacked together and punched with a 3 cm diameter borer. LAB: Punches from each plant were dried, pooled, and weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg to calculate specific leaf weight (SLW = mg cm-2). Total N was determined using a LECO TruSpec CN analyzer (St. Joseph, MI), and total P was determined colorometrically following perchloric acid digests using a modified Technicon autoanalyzer. N and P resorption were calculated as the difference in peak and senescent leaf nutrient contents expressed as a percentage of peak values. geoReference 2009-07-01 2009-10-01 Sampling Frequency As needed"

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Located at the base of the shallow-sloping Florida peninsula, the Everglades wilderness and 6 million human residents are exceptionally exposed to both pressures. Further, freshwater drainage has accelerated saltwater intrusion over land and into the porous limestone aquifer, resulting in coastal ecosystem transgression and seasonal residential freshwater shortages. The unprecedented landscape-scale Everglades restoration process is expected to reverse some of these trends. However, it is not clear how uncertainties about climate change prognoses and their impacts (e.g., sea level rise (SLR), changes in storm activity or severity, and climate drivers of freshwater availability) may influence human activities (e.g., population growth, resource use, land-use change), and how their interaction will affect the restoration process that is already steeped in conflict. The Florida Coastal Everglades Long-Term Ecological Research (FCE LTER) program is dedicated to long-term coupled biophysical and cultural studies that expose and unravel complex feedbacks that generate distinctive patterns and processes in vulnerable coastal ecosystems. The overarching theme of FCE research is: In the coastal Everglades, climate change and resource management decisions interact to influence freshwater availability, ecosystem dynamics, and the value and utilization of ecosystem services by people. Because they are highly sensitive to the balance of freshwater and marine influences, coastal wetlands of the Florida Everglades provide an ideal system to examine how socio-ecological systems respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change and freshwater allocation decisions. The trans-disciplinary science conducted by the large FCE research team is revealing how estuary hydrodynamics and biogeochemistry may tilt on a fulcrum defined by the magnitude by which coastal pressures (SRL, storms) are mitigated by freshwater flows. We employ a socio-ecological framework to address how climate change interacts with political decisions to determine the sustainability of interconnected human-natural systems. In FCE I, we discovered how coastal nutrient supplies create an unusual “upside-down” productivity gradient in karstic estuaries. FCE II research used growing long-term datasets to reveal the sensitivity of this gradient to changes in hydrodynamics, nutrient availability, and salinity. In FCE III, we will use South Florida as an exemplary system for understanding how and why socio-ecological systems resist, adapt to, or mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystem sustainability. We will examine how decisions about freshwater delivery to the Everglades influence -and are influenced by - the impact of SLR in this especially vulnerable landscape. Biophysical studies will focus on how this balance of fresh and marine sources influences biogeochemical cycling, primary production, organic matter dynamics, and trophic dynamics, to drive carbon gains and losses. We expand our spatio-temporal domain by employing powerful long-term datasets and experiments to determine legacies of past interactions, and to constrain models that will help guide a sustainable future for the FCE.

The information gleaned from the pilot spreader swale construction will then be utilized to determine if constructing more spreader swales along the Tamiami Trail will be a cost beneficial option to increase flow along the Tamiami Trail. Part of the pilot spreader swale project will be to assess potential water quality and ecological effects associated with the construction and the implementation of the pilot spreader swales if they are constructed. This will be achieved through the water quality, fish/invertebrate, and vegetation/periphyton monitoring programs. The monitoring conducted prior and during pilot spreader swales will provide critical information that will help understand the level of impacts associated with the construction and implementation of the pilot spreader swales if they are constructed. If the pilot spreader swales do prove effective at improving hydrologic conveyance, it will also provide information as to whether the benefit of the pilot spreader swales provide is worth the environmental impacts caused by the construction and implementation of the pilot spreader swales.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

The information gleaned from the pilot spreader swale construction will then be utilized to determine if constructing more spreader swales along the Tamiami Trail will be a cost beneficial option to increase flow along the Tamiami Trail. Part of the pilot spreader swale project will be to assess potential water quality and ecological effects associated with the construction and the implementation of the pilot spreader swales if they are constructed. This will be achieved through the water quality, fish/invertebrate, and vegetation/periphyton monitoring programs. The monitoring conducted prior and during pilot spreader swales will provide critical information that will help understand the level of impacts associated with the construction and implementation of the pilot spreader swales if they are constructed. If the pilot spreader swales do prove effective at improving hydrologic conveyance, it will also provide information as to whether the benefit of the pilot spreader swales provide is worth the environmental impacts caused by the construction and implementation of the pilot spreader swales.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) contains human population (total) measurements in number units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements.

Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Florida Coastal Everglades and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00061-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Santee Experimental Forest (SAN) contains ammonium in wet deposition measurements in kilogramsPerHectare units and were aggregated to a monthly timescale."

00061-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed.

00061-metadata.xml,Resource Use Constraints,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Santee Experimental Forest and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Bent Creek Experimental Forest (BEN) contains Palmer Drought Severity Index measurements in dimensionless units and were aggregated to a monthly timescale."

These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements.

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Bent Creek Experimental Forest and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Shortgrass Steppe (SGS) contains plant density of Sisymbrium altissimum measurements in numberPerMeterSquared units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Shortgrass Steppe and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00064-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This LTER Remote Sensing spatial raster dataset consists of LEDAPS corrected Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data for Sevilleta LTER, originally collected on 1995-01-28 (16:50:57.3710880Z) by Landsat 5, row 036, path 033. Cloud cover was 0 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

These data are Landsat image band files that have been corrected using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) Algorithm and are stored in HDF format. The Landsat standard data products used in this dataset were processed using the Level 1 Product Generation System (LPGS) with the following parameters applied: GeoTIFF output format Cubic Convolution (CC) resampling method 30-meter (TM, ETM+) and 60-meter (MSS) pixel size (reflective bands) Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection (Polar Stereographic projection for Antarctica) World Geodetic System (WGS) 84 datum MAP (North-up) image orientation About the Landsat Thematic Mapper 'The Thematic Mapper (TM) is an advanced, multispectral scanning, Earth resources sensor designed to achieve higher image resolution, sharper spectral separation, improved geometric fidelity and greater radiometric accuracy and resolution than the MSS sensor. TM data are sensed in seven spectral bands simultaneously. Band 6 senses thermal (heat) infrared radiation. Landsat can only acquire night scenes in band 6.

These images were converted to surface reflectance using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS http://code.google.com/p/ledaps/). The LEDAPS process convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to corrected surface reflectance. The LEDAPS project is hosted by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Land Satellite Data Systems (LSDS) Science Research and Development (LSRD) Project. Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) processes Landsat data from Level 1B (L1B) to surface reflectance using atmospheric correction routines similar to that developed for the MODIS instrument. This package includes three basic modules (plus a parameter parser and an internal cloud detection program) to convert Landsat data from digital numbers (DN) to surface reflectance. The three steps include: Calibrate digital number (DN) to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Correct to surface reflectance from TOA reflectance and ancillary data sets. Detect cloud pixels based on the surface reflectance. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Coweeta (CWT) contains population employed in service (percent of total) measurements in percent units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Coweeta and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00069-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Soil pH, Eh and temperature readings are taken at TS/Ph1b,TS/Ph2,TS/Ph3 and TS/Ph6b. These measurements are taken only when the marsh is wet. Measurements are taken using an Orion model 250A meter, and the probes attached to the meter are the Orion Thermo pH probe and the Orion Eh probe. All readings are recorded in field notebooks, and then transferred into Microsoft Excel. The Eh reading is taken when the Eh probe is attached to the meter and the word 'Ready' appears on the meter screen. The pH and temperature reading are taken when the pH probe is attached to the meter and the word 'Ready' appears on the meter screen."

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

Our long term research program focuses on testing the following central idea and hypotheses: Regional processes mediated by water flow control population and ecosystem level dynamics at any location within the coastal Everglades landscape. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the dynamics of an estuarine oligohaline zone where fresh water draining phosphorus-limited Everglades marshes mixes with water from the more nitrogen-limited coastal ocean. Hypothesis 1: In nutrient-poor coastal systems, long-term changes in the quantity or quality of organic matter inputs will exert strong and direct controls on estuarine productivity, because inorganic nutrients are at such low levels. Hypothesis 2: Interannual and long-term changes in freshwater flow controls the magnitude of nutrients and organic matter inputs to the estuarine zone, while ecological processes in the freshwater marsh and coastal ocean control the quality and characteristics of those inputs. Hypothesis 3: Long-term changes in freshwater flow (primarily manifest through management and Everglades restoration) will interact with long-term changes in the climatic and disturbance (sea level rise, hurricanes, fires) regimes to modify ecological pattern and process across coastal landscapes.

This dynamic is affected by the interaction of local ecological processes and landscape-scale drivers (hydrologic, climatological, and human). During FCE I, our ideas about how these 'upside-down' estuaries (Childers et al. 2006) function has evolved, and we have modified our central theme to reflect this new understanding. Our focus in FCE II will be even more strongly on the oligohaline ecotone region of our experimental transects. For FCE II, our overarching theme is: In the coastal Everglades landscape, population and ecosystem-level dynamics are controlled by the relative importance of water source, water residence time, and local biotic processes. This phenomenon is best exemplified in the oligohaline ecotone, where these 3 factors interact most strongly and vary over many [temporal and spatial] scales.Hypothesis 1: Increasing inputs of fresh water will enhance oligotrophy in nutrient-poor coastal systems, as long as the inflowing water has low nutrient content; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone. Hypothesis 2: An increase in freshwater inflow will increase the physical transport of detrital organic matter to the oligohaline ecotone, which will enhance estuarine productivity. The quality of these allochthonous detrital inputs will be controlled by upstream ecological processes. Hypothesis 3: Water residence time, groundwater inputs, and tidal energy interact with climatic and disturbance regimes to modify ecological pattern and process in oligotrophic estuaries; this dynamic will be most pronounced in the oligohaline ecotone.

00070-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Sustainability of the forest at a regional scale in landscapes dominated by non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership depends on the often-independent actions and behaviors of thousands of private families and individuals. These NIPF lands comprise the dominant forest ownership in many parts of the United States, and represent an important part of the greater forest landscape matrix even in parts of the region where industrial and/or public lands dominate. In northeastern states, NIPF lands can represent 75% or more of total forest area. While forest landowner attitudinal survey work in the past several decades has explored reasons for ownership, motivations, and perspectives on traditional management (e.g., do you intend to harvest in the next 10 years?), little if any study has focused on attitudes and, importantly, documented behaviors related to sustainability on their lands. Some landowner attitudes pertaining to the notion of sustainability can be inferred from earlier work (e.g., documented interest in wildlife habitat and nature, aesthetics, and privacy), but these do not directly link to sustainability or timber productivity on their own lands. As the urban-rural interface expands from metropolitan centers, though this wooded landscape may appear to be forested from the air, it no longer sustains a number of benefits upon which society has grown to depend. In particular, timber harvesting declines as a viable and sustainable land use activity. We seek to: 1. Study the decision-making process, priorities, and behaviors of different types of NIPF owners, in terms of sustainable harvesting, and sale/ development; 2. Use landscape-scale spatial data and associated demographic data to assess the extent to which such landscapes can remain sustainable producers of wood products in the face of expanding urban/ suburban influence; and 3. study sites that have sustained harvests and document the successional trajectory, in an effort to estimate the future composition of the forest landscape based on this form of human-induced disturbance. In so doing, we will identify characteristics of a NIPF landscape in which harvesting or the production of timber is no longer sustainable. Sustainable timber production from local forested landscapes plays a role in global environmental quality. In the Illusion of Preservation, Berlik et al argue for decreases in wood consumption, coupled with increases in local wood production, to avoid 'exporting' the need to harvest wood from countries that have a negligible environmental safety net. The result of this is that forest that does not sustainably produce wood 'at home' in effect shifts the demand to other places, thereby making local preservation an illusion."

00070-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Background Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 132 covers forestry in the Commonwealth. Sections 40-47 specifically refer to forest cutting practices. For specific text see: http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/gl-132-toc.htm. MGL Ch. 132, section 41 established the formation of a state forestry committee to create forest practice regulations and guidelines. Though chapter 132 sections 40-47 have been in effect since the 1940s, they were changed by the state forestry committee in the early 1980s to require submission of a Forest Cutting Plan (FCP) prior to any harvest greater than 25 Mbf or 50 cords or any combination thereof. FCPs need review and approval by Bureau of Forestry Service Foresters. The regulations were more recently revised in 1994-1995, and became effective 1 January 1996 (304 CMR 11.00 – 11.10). see: http://www.mass.gov/dem/regs/304011a.htm. Information on the Forest Cutting Practices Act and its implementing regulations are here: http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/forestry/service/cutprac.htm. Since 1983, the regulations have required submission of a FCP, including two maps, thus enabling the estimated capture of the spatial location of harvest activity on public and private land in Massachusetts. Explanation of the rules/ regs/process Prior to any timber harvest greater than 25 thousand board feet (Mbf) or 50 cords or any combination thereof, on public or private land, a Forest Cutting Plan [FCP] must be submitted to as regional office of the Massachusetts Bureau of Forestry. Once the FCP is submitted, the Bureau has 10 business days to review and approve or disapprove the FCP, or else harvest may begin, as long as it is not in a wetland resource area that falls under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Wetland Protection act (MGL chapter 131). A FCP must describe the proposed harvest in terms of silviculture, management intent (i.e., long-term management, or short-term liquidation of timber value, devoid of legitimate long-term forest management intent), estimated volumes to be removed, and erosion control methods to be applied (Best Management Practices). In addition, two maps must be prepared: one of the actual property, showing the proposed harvest area, access, and any streams, wetlands, or other water resources), and one locus map placing the property in a larger context most commonly [though not always] on a topographic quad map. For a sample FCP, see: http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/forestry/docs/sample132LT.doc. FCPs may only be prepared by: a licensed forester, a licensed timber harvester, or the actual owner of the property. The Bureau of Forestry Service Forester makes a site visit as part of the approval process to determine if the proposed harvest will be in compliance with cutting practice regulations. If approved, an orange permit is posted on the landing /access point of the operation. An approved FCP is valid for two years, with up to two additional one-year extensions. Service Foresters make periodic interim inspections and a final inspection to ensure compliance with the regulations. Upon making a final inspection, Service Foresters issue a Certificate of Compliance appended to the original cutting plan. Chapter 132 only requires submission of a FCP for land that will remain in forest use following the harvest. Thus, a FCP is NOT required for harvest operations that will result in a change of land use, e.g., from forest to developed use. As a result, these data only reflect harvest for areas that have remained in forest, and thus not all harvesting. Data acquisition process Summer 1995: REU student Cinnie Chou begins data acquisition. She gathered ch. 132 forest cutting plans [FCPs] for ten contiguous towns on the western side of the 19-town North Quabbin Study Region [Erving, Leverett, Montague, New Salem, Northfield, Orange, Pelham, Shutesbury, Warwick, Wendell] by traveling to the two Bureau of Forestry regional offices that have data for those towns. Note that the western boundary of the 19-town North Quabbin Study Region is scribed not by town boundaries, but by the change in ecoregion from uplands to the Connecticut River Valley. Thus some of the western towns were not entirely captured. Data acquisition at this phase consisted of: Acquire photocopies of ch.132 FCPs for the ten towns. Free-hand estimate / draw the polygon of the harvest onto a hard-copy usgs topo quad, interpreting its location by reading the FCP and its two maps, and following contour lines, boundaries, and other features (e.g., steams, roads). Once all harvest polygons have been drawn on the topo quads, tape the quad sheets to a digitizer, register the corners, and digitize the polygons (using “Roots” software). Give each polygon a unique identifier, and enter tabular attribute data. Topo quads were then merged with one another and georeferenced, to compile a total; landscape-level rendition of a spatial estimate of harvest in ten towns for ten years (1984 - 1993). This one data layer was then rasterized in Idrisi for subsequent initial data analysis. Preliminary data looked interesting. It was decided to capture the remaining 9 towns in the North Quabbin Study Region in the fall of 1995, winter 1996 (i.e., Athol, Barre, Hardwick, Hubbardston, Petersham, Phillipston, Royalston, Templeton, Winchendon). Ken Holmberg, an outside gis contractor, was hired to capture these data in the same way. At this point, FCP data were acquired for 19 towns, 1984-1995. Subsequent to this, Ben Slater, HF GIS specialist, converted the Idrisi [raster] files to ArcView [vector] format. Summer 1999: REU student Andrew Finley acquired additional FCP data for the 19 NQ towns, bringing the data up-to-date for 1984 - 1999. Finley introduces new data capture technique: Acquires photocopies of the FCPs from the Bureau of Forestry regional offices. Acquires topographic quad TIF files from MASSGIS and brings them up in ArcView. Heads-up free-hand digitizing of the harvest polygons on-screen, by interpreting harvest boundaries according to topographic features, roads, boundaries, and other information from the harvest plan and its two maps. Summer 2000: REU student Andrew Finley returns to capture more North Quabbin data for the 19 towns, bringing the data up to date for 1984 - 2000. 2000 - 2002: data analysis and manuscript preparation, resulting in: Kittredge, D.B., A.O. Finley, and D.R. Foster. 2003. Timber harvesting as ongoing disturbance in a landscape of diverse ownership. Forest Ecology and Management. 180 (2003) 425–442. 2001: John Burk, Harvard Forest staff archivist, begins to capture FCP data from across the Commonwealth for 1997 - 2001. This involves visiting the 5 regional Bureau of Forestry offices across the Commonwealth, and either capturing data as described previously on a laptop computer, or, photocopying FCPs and bringing them back to HF for subsequent data entry. Once these data are acquired statewide, the decision is made to go back and acquire all data from the 5 regional offices from 1984 forward. All data are gathered and entered by John Burk, according to the following schema: (1) Collecting Plans. Chapter 132 cutting plans for the fiscal years 1984 to 2003 were gathered from the files of state foresters for each of the five Department of Environmental Management regional districts. The districts were numbered as follows: 1=Southeast, 2=Northeast, 3=Central, 4=Connecticut Valley (with a separate office for the Westfield River communities), and 5=Berkshire. Gaps in the data exist for Middlesex County from 1984 to 1988, and Essex County for 1985 to 1996 (both housed in the region 2 office in Carlisle). These plans were reported as discarded by the DEM, and extensive searching by John Burk and state foresters Jack Jackson and Laura Dooley have failed to turn up anything. There may be other isolated harvests for which paperwork was lost or misfiled over the years. Plans marked “disapproved” or “not cut” were not entered. It is possible that other harvests which were approved were not carried out (In informal conversations, based on field experience DEM/DCR foresters estimated that perhaps 5-10% of areas for which FCPs filed were not harvested). If two or more identical plans for the same property were filed in different years, the most recent was entered and the others disregarded, the assumption being that the recent was a refiling of the older plan and not a separate harvest. (2) Digital. The program used to map harvest data was Arcview GIS, in conjunction with digital USGS topographic maps from MassGIS. Each cutting plan usually contained two maps, a locus map (a general map of the town showing the location of the property to be harvested) and a more detailed map of the specific location, including harvest boundaries. While many locus maps were drawn on topographic sheets, a number of others were either: (a) drawn on less detailed street or survey maps, or (b) missing entirely, increasing the potential for error. Polygons representing harvest areas were drawn freehand onto the topographic MassGIS quads, based on the specific harvest boundaries marked on the property map, and also taking into consideration details such as acres reported, boundaries of adjacent harvests, and natural/human features such as ponds, roads, and buildings. As the plans were prepared by many different individuals for regulatory purposes, there is inconsistency in the level of detail on the maps. (3) Data Entry. For each polygon, the following information was recorded from the original cutting plan: File Number (the DEM/DCR number of the plan, i.e. HD05696). Fiscal Year. Date Received (date the plan was filed with the DEM). Town where the harvest occurred. Town 2 (if the harvest area covered more than one town). Landowner Name. Landowner Type: a numeric code assigned as follows: 1-DEM (DCR) state lands. 2-MDC. 3- Local agencies: town DPWs, airports, commissions, etc. 4- Nonprofits: conservation groups, churches. 5- Private landowners . 6- Sawmills, industrial forestland owned by a processing firm. 7- U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 8- MA Fish and Wildlife. Private: whether the person/agency filing the plan was a Massachusetts public land owner, indicated by a (Y)es or (N)o. Wetland Crossing: (Y)es if a wetland or stream crossing was indicated on the form, blank if no. Stand treatment data was recorded for the following categories, using codes provided on the cutting plan form: Forest Type: WP=White Pine, WK=Pine/Hemlock, WH=Pine/Hardwood, WO=Pine/Oak, RP=Red Pine, SR=Red Spruce, SF=Spruce, PP=Pitch Pine, PO=Pitch Pine/Oak, HK=Hemlock, HH=Hemlock/Hardwood, TK=Tamarack, CD=Cedar, OH=Oak/Hardwood, BW=White Birch, OR=Red Oak, OM=Mixed Oak, RM=Red Maple, BC=Black Cherry, BB=Beech/Birch/Maple, SM=Sugar Maple, BM=Birch/Red Maple, BE=Beech, OT=Other. Primary Objective(s) of Cut: WP=Wood Production, WH=Wildlife Habitat, IMP=Improvement, IN=Short term income, SW=soils and water management, AR=aesthetics/recreation, INTER=intermediate, SA=salvage, OT=other. Note: the cutting plan form changed after 1996, and the codes IMP and INTER were discontinued. Type(s) of Regeneration Cut: SE=Selective, SH=Shelterwood, ST=Seed Tree, CC=Clearcut, SA=Salvage, CO=Coppice, CS=Coppice with Standards, OT=Other. Multiple forest types, objectives, and regenerative cuts were sometimes listed for each stand (i.e. WPINSW). Species Data for types of trees harvested: Volume totals for each species harvested were recorded. All totals are presented in MBF unless otherwise noted; a small number of plans had totals presented as a percentage or in cords. When the forms were changed in 1997, Black Oak was added as a species; prior to this it was included in “other oak.” The category “other hardwood” sometimes was used as a general reference to a ‘hardwood’ stand. A number of plans had no information for species harvested. No species data were collected for the North Quabbin pilot study during the initial phase of the project. These data were added by John Burk during 2002-03. Approximately 100-125 additional North Quabbin 1984-96 plans were also discovered and added to the chapter 132 ‘all years’ file. The total MBF and total cords data recorded was based on the number given in the plan, and is subject to any errors made by the plan’s preparer. Number of polygons (drawn for each plan): This ranged from 1 to 35; the higher numbers were usually state agencies making numerous small (1-2 acre) fuelwood or management harvests and filing them under one plan. Note that once approved, an operator has 2 years to perform an approved harvest and may apply for 2, one-year extensions; i.e. a plan approved in 2003 may not be cut until 2005 (or with extensions, until 2007). Data quality control Julie Hall began independently capturing in a heads-up digitizing format a ~ 4% sample of FCPs. These sampled FCPs were compared with the FCP polygons in the original dataset. Results: (1) Differences in area between the FCPs digitized by Burk and Hall are unsystematic, with neither source being consistently higher or lower, and uncorrelated, so that errors tend to cancel when areas of FCPs are added across the state?. On average (median), for any FCP the two sources are 18% different in area. (2) For any FCP, the median distance from the centroid of Burk’s polygon to Hall’s polygon is 88m. Data acquisition caveats Ch. 132 FCPs were prepared originally by a wide variety of foresters, loggers, and private landowners. There is a minimal standard required by the regulating agency, and the data are required for regulatory purposes, not research. Thus, there is a wide range in quality of FCPs submitted, from maps and volume estimates that are computer generated and prepared by professional foresters with 4, 6, or more years of higher education and years of professional experience, to “back-of-napkin” estimates of volume, area, and spatial location that were barely adequate - but apparently acceptable - for regulatory purposes. The Bureau of Forestry service forester apparently had sufficient information on the plan to make a field visit and ensure compliance with forest practice regulations. Thus there is a considerable range in data quality that the acquirers of data had to contend with as they worked to interpret spatial and tabular information on the plans, and capture it in the database. Artistic rendition of polygons. Harvest areas have not generally been surveyed or ground truthed. The original polygons from the FCPs are the plan preparer’s best estimate of where the harvest took place, for regulatory purposes. In turn, the GIS rendition of a harvest polygon by the data acquirers was their best estimate of where the harvest occurred based on maps and descriptions in the FCPs. There was no field checking, however, on the part of data entry staff. These digitized best estimates of harvest polygon location are thus “best estimates of best estimates”, and thus can not be construed to represent actual truth on the ground - only the best faith effort to characterize spatially where a harvest event occurred. Likewise, preparers of FCPs report their estimate of the area harvested [in acres], but this is merely their estimate. They are not required to survey or use other spatial techniques to determine area. Depending on the plan preparer, the area of harvest may be determined by a dot-grid estimation method, based on tax assessment estimates of area of the property, or be a simple guess to round numbers. It is likely that the estimated spatial extent of the proposed harvest area, as described on the FCP’s maps, provide a better estimate of the spatial extent and thus area, than an estimate of area. Thus, it is probably preferable to use the gis-calculated areas of harvest polygons, rather than the estimated areas reported by plan preparers. Volume estimates are exactly that - estimates. These estimates are required as part of the regulatory process, though nobody officially checks or controls them. And- the FCPs are filed before the harvest as part of an approval process. There is no confirmation of the final volume removed. Chapter 132 only requires submission of a FCP for land that will remain in forest use following the harvest. Thus, a FCP is NOT required for harvest operations that will result in a change of land use, e.g., from forest to developed use. As a result, these data only reflect harvest for areas that have remained in forest, and thus not all harvesting. Chapter 132 requires FCPs submitted for harvest operations greater than 25 Mbf. [from Alerich 2000: 1 Mbf = 3.48 cubic meters. Although 1 Mbf are theoretically equivalent to 2.36 cubic meters, this is true only when a board foot is actually a piece of wood with a volume of 1/12 of a cubic foot. The International ¼-inch log rule is used by the USDA Forest Service in the East to estimate the product potential in board feet. The reliability of the estimate obtained by conversion will vary with the size of the log measured. The conversion of 3.48 cubic meters to 1 Mbf is based on the cubic volume of a log 16 feet long and 15 inches in diameter, inside bark and the small end. Because the board foot unit is not a true measure of wood volume and because products other than dimension lumber are becoming important, this unit may eventually be phased out and replaced by the cubic meter]. Harvest operations commonly remove between 2 and 10 Mbf/acre, resulting in 25 Mbf representing a relatively small area. It is unlikely that a commercial timber sale would remove less than this amount, due to adverse economies of scale. It is possible that small operations will remove less than the threshold amount and still file a FCP, since an approved FCP creates an exemption from the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (MGL Chapter 131). It is improbable that much commercial harvest falls beneath 25 Mbf and this is not accounted for in these FCP data, and indeed, it is quite possible that smaller operations are included due to the advantageous wetlands protection exemption. Some small-scale, non-commercial harvesting (less than 25 Mbf) that does not require FCPs to be filed also occurs on private lands, although the distribution and volume of such harvests is unknown. FCPs only list the official date that they are approved, but they are valid for a two-year period, and are eligible for up to two one-year extensions. Thus, it is difficult to say exactly when the harvest occurred, other than to conclude that it happened within the 2 to 4 year window following date of approval. “Date” thus provides only an approximate indication of the timing of harvest. The upshot of these caveats is this: The more than 13,000 harvest events represent the best estimate or collective characterization of harvest activity that took place between 1984 and 2003 across ownerships throughout Massachusetts (roughly 2.6 million acres of forest, out of a total of 5 Million acres of land). It is possible that any individual event may not be depicted in a spatially accurate way (e.g., either the best estimate of the plan preparer, and / or the best estimate of the data acquirer may result in the depiction of a harvest polygon as spatially inaccurate). Consequently, the data can not be used with confidence to represent specific individual harvest events. It remains however, to our knowledge the best estimate of harvest activity at a broad spatial landscape scale over two decades across the diversity of public and private ownerships typical of Massachusetts and much of the eastern United States. Alerich, C.L. 2000. Forest statistics for Massachusetts: 1985 and 1998. USDA Forest Service Resource Bulletin NE-148. 104 pp. Further data processing notes To ease data manipulation, the FILE_ID (the code assigned by the state to a cut) was standardized so that all letters are in lower case. For example, “HD9599” was changed to “hd9599”. Previously, the dataset had a mix of lower and upper case letters. Furthermore, the ArcView shapefile PAT was simplified to contain solely the FILE_ID. The boundaries of the polygons are thus saved in the shapefile all_cutting_plans_v3.shp (and related files), while the remaining information that Burk et al. entered was stored in a separate DBF file: plan_info.dbf. A shapefile containing the centroid of all the harvesting polygons was created, for use when graphing information at a statewide level: all_cutting_plans_v3_point (and related files). The varying units of volume in the original dataset (usually MBF, but sometime tons, cords, etc.) were standardized to m3, using published conversion factors. Some FCPs had missing data or unrealistic data, and those FCPs were not included in this calculation. Using the digitized area of the FCP, cutting intensity (m3/ha) was calculated as well. Information is stored in: volume_and_intensity_v4.dbf. The format of this file mirrors that of the original dataset to some extent. The columns are: FILE_ID: the ID code given the plan by the state.

00070-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Background Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 132 covers forestry in the Commonwealth. Sections 40-47 specifically refer to forest cutting practices. For specific text see: http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/mgl/gl-132-toc.htm. MGL Ch. 132, section 41 established the formation of a state forestry committee to create forest practice regulations and guidelines. Though chapter 132 sections 40-47 have been in effect since the 1940s, they were changed by the state forestry committee in the early 1980s to require submission of a Forest Cutting Plan (FCP) prior to any harvest greater than 25 Mbf or 50 cords or any combination thereof. FCPs need review and approval by Bureau of Forestry Service Foresters. The regulations were more recently revised in 1994-1995, and became effective 1 January 1996 (304 CMR 11.00 – 11.10). see: http://www.mass.gov/dem/regs/304011a.htm. Information on the Forest Cutting Practices Act and its implementing regulations are here: http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/forestry/service/cutprac.htm. Since 1983, the regulations have required submission of a FCP, including two maps, thus enabling the estimated capture of the spatial location of harvest activity on public and private land in Massachusetts. Explanation of the rules/ regs/process Prior to any timber harvest greater than 25 thousand board feet (Mbf) or 50 cords or any combination thereof, on public or private land, a Forest Cutting Plan [FCP] must be submitted to as regional office of the Massachusetts Bureau of Forestry. Once the FCP is submitted, the Bureau has 10 business days to review and approve or disapprove the FCP, or else harvest may begin, as long as it is not in a wetland resource area that falls under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Wetland Protection act (MGL chapter 131). A FCP must describe the proposed harvest in terms of silviculture, management intent (i.e., long-term management, or short-term liquidation of timber value, devoid of legitimate long-term forest management intent), estimated volumes to be removed, and erosion control methods to be applied (Best Management Practices). In addition, two maps must be prepared: one of the actual property, showing the proposed harvest area, access, and any streams, wetlands, or other water resources), and one locus map placing the property in a larger context most commonly [though not always] on a topographic quad map. For a sample FCP, see: http://www.mass.gov/dcr/stewardship/forestry/docs/sample132LT.doc. FCPs may only be prepared by: a licensed forester, a licensed timber harvester, or the actual owner of the property. The Bureau of Forestry Service Forester makes a site visit as part of the approval process to determine if the proposed harvest will be in compliance with cutting practice regulations. If approved, an orange permit is posted on the landing /access point of the operation. An approved FCP is valid for two years, with up to two additional one-year extensions. Service Foresters make periodic interim inspections and a final inspection to ensure compliance with the regulations. Upon making a final inspection, Service Foresters issue a Certificate of Compliance appended to the original cutting plan. Chapter 132 only requires submission of a FCP for land that will remain in forest use following the harvest. Thus, a FCP is NOT required for harvest operations that will result in a change of land use, e.g., from forest to developed use. As a result, these data only reflect harvest for areas that have remained in forest, and thus not all harvesting. Data acquisition process Summer 1995: REU student Cinnie Chou begins data acquisition. She gathered ch. 132 forest cutting plans [FCPs] for ten contiguous towns on the western side of the 19-town North Quabbin Study Region [Erving, Leverett, Montague, New Salem, Northfield, Orange, Pelham, Shutesbury, Warwick, Wendell] by traveling to the two Bureau of Forestry regional offices that have data for those towns. Note that the western boundary of the 19-town North Quabbin Study Region is scribed not by town boundaries, but by the change in ecoregion from uplands to the Connecticut River Valley. Thus some of the western towns were not entirely captured. Data acquisition at this phase consisted of: Acquire photocopies of ch.132 FCPs for the ten towns. Free-hand estimate / draw the polygon of the harvest onto a hard-copy usgs topo quad, interpreting its location by reading the FCP and its two maps, and following contour lines, boundaries, and other features (e.g., steams, roads). Once all harvest polygons have been drawn on the topo quads, tape the quad sheets to a digitizer, register the corners, and digitize the polygons (using “Roots” software). Give each polygon a unique identifier, and enter tabular attribute data. Topo quads were then merged with one another and georeferenced, to compile a total; landscape-level rendition of a spatial estimate of harvest in ten towns for ten years (1984 - 1993). This one data layer was then rasterized in Idrisi for subsequent initial data analysis. Preliminary data looked interesting. It was decided to capture the remaining 9 towns in the North Quabbin Study Region in the fall of 1995, winter 1996 (i.e., Athol, Barre, Hardwick, Hubbardston, Petersham, Phillipston, Royalston, Templeton, Winchendon). Ken Holmberg, an outside gis contractor, was hired to capture these data in the same way. At this point, FCP data were acquired for 19 towns, 1984-1995. Subsequent to this, Ben Slater, HF GIS specialist, converted the Idrisi [raster] files to ArcView [vector] format. Summer 1999: REU student Andrew Finley acquired additional FCP data for the 19 NQ towns, bringing the data up-to-date for 1984 - 1999. Finley introduces new data capture technique: Acquires photocopies of the FCPs from the Bureau of Forestry regional offices. Acquires topographic quad TIF files from MASSGIS and brings them up in ArcView. Heads-up free-hand digitizing of the harvest polygons on-screen, by interpreting harvest boundaries according to topographic features, roads, boundaries, and other information from the harvest plan and its two maps. Summer 2000: REU student Andrew Finley returns to capture more North Quabbin data for the 19 towns, bringing the data up to date for 1984 - 2000. 2000 - 2002: data analysis and manuscript preparation, resulting in: Kittredge, D.B., A.O. Finley, and D.R. Foster. 2003. Timber harvesting as ongoing disturbance in a landscape of diverse ownership. Forest Ecology and Management. 180 (2003) 425–442. 2001: John Burk, Harvard Forest staff archivist, begins to capture FCP data from across the Commonwealth for 1997 - 2001. This involves visiting the 5 regional Bureau of Forestry offices across the Commonwealth, and either capturing data as described previously on a laptop computer, or, photocopying FCPs and bringing them back to HF for subsequent data entry. Once these data are acquired statewide, the decision is made to go back and acquire all data from the 5 regional offices from 1984 forward. All data are gathered and entered by John Burk, according to the following schema: (1) Collecting Plans. Chapter 132 cutting plans for the fiscal years 1984 to 2003 were gathered from the files of state foresters for each of the five Department of Environmental Management regional districts. The districts were numbered as follows: 1=Southeast, 2=Northeast, 3=Central, 4=Connecticut Valley (with a separate office for the Westfield River communities), and 5=Berkshire. Gaps in the data exist for Middlesex County from 1984 to 1988, and Essex County for 1985 to 1996 (both housed in the region 2 office in Carlisle). These plans were reported as discarded by the DEM, and extensive searching by John Burk and state foresters Jack Jackson and Laura Dooley have failed to turn up anything. There may be other isolated harvests for which paperwork was lost or misfiled over the years. Plans marked “disapproved” or “not cut” were not entered. It is possible that other harvests which were approved were not carried out (In informal conversations, based on field experience DEM/DCR foresters estimated that perhaps 5-10% of areas for which FCPs filed were not harvested). If two or more identical plans for the same property were filed in different years, the most recent was entered and the others disregarded, the assumption being that the recent was a refiling of the older plan and not a separate harvest. (2) Digital. The program used to map harvest data was Arcview GIS, in conjunction with digital USGS topographic maps from MassGIS. Each cutting plan usually contained two maps, a locus map (a general map of the town showing the location of the property to be harvested) and a more detailed map of the specific location, including harvest boundaries. While many locus maps were drawn on topographic sheets, a number of others were either: (a) drawn on less detailed street or survey maps, or (b) missing entirely, increasing the potential for error. Polygons representing harvest areas were drawn freehand onto the topographic MassGIS quads, based on the specific harvest boundaries marked on the property map, and also taking into consideration details such as acres reported, boundaries of adjacent harvests, and natural/human features such as ponds, roads, and buildings. As the plans were prepared by many different individuals for regulatory purposes, there is inconsistency in the level of detail on the maps. (3) Data Entry. For each polygon, the following information was recorded from the original cutting plan: File Number (the DEM/DCR number of the plan, i.e. HD05696). Fiscal Year. Date Received (date the plan was filed with the DEM). Town where the harvest occurred. Town 2 (if the harvest area covered more than one town). Landowner Name. Landowner Type: a numeric code assigned as follows: 1-DEM (DCR) state lands. 2-MDC. 3- Local agencies: town DPWs, airports, commissions, etc. 4- Nonprofits: conservation groups, churches. 5- Private landowners . 6- Sawmills, industrial forestland owned by a processing firm. 7- U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 8- MA Fish and Wildlife. Private: whether the person/agency filing the plan was a Massachusetts public land owner, indicated by a (Y)es or (N)o. Wetland Crossing: (Y)es if a wetland or stream crossing was indicated on the form, blank if no. Stand treatment data was recorded for the following categories, using codes provided on the cutting plan form: Forest Type: WP=White Pine, WK=Pine/Hemlock, WH=Pine/Hardwood, WO=Pine/Oak, RP=Red Pine, SR=Red Spruce, SF=Spruce, PP=Pitch Pine, PO=Pitch Pine/Oak, HK=Hemlock, HH=Hemlock/Hardwood, TK=Tamarack, CD=Cedar, OH=Oak/Hardwood, BW=White Birch, OR=Red Oak, OM=Mixed Oak, RM=Red Maple, BC=Black Cherry, BB=Beech/Birch/Maple, SM=Sugar Maple, BM=Birch/Red Maple, BE=Beech, OT=Other. Primary Objective(s) of Cut: WP=Wood Production, WH=Wildlife Habitat, IMP=Improvement, IN=Short term income, SW=soils and water management, AR=aesthetics/recreation, INTER=intermediate, SA=salvage, OT=other. Note: the cutting plan form changed after 1996, and the codes IMP and INTER were discontinued. Type(s) of Regeneration Cut: SE=Selective, SH=Shelterwood, ST=Seed Tree, CC=Clearcut, SA=Salvage, CO=Coppice, CS=Coppice with Standards, OT=Other. Multiple forest types, objectives, and regenerative cuts were sometimes listed for each stand (i.e. WPINSW). Species Data for types of trees harvested: Volume totals for each species harvested were recorded. All totals are presented in MBF unless otherwise noted; a small number of plans had totals presented as a percentage or in cords. When the forms were changed in 1997, Black Oak was added as a species; prior to this it was included in “other oak.” The category “other hardwood” sometimes was used as a general reference to a ‘hardwood’ stand. A number of plans had no information for species harvested. No species data were collected for the North Quabbin pilot study during the initial phase of the project. These data were added by John Burk during 2002-03. Approximately 100-125 additional North Quabbin 1984-96 plans were also discovered and added to the chapter 132 ‘all years’ file. The total MBF and total cords data recorded was based on the number given in the plan, and is subject to any errors made by the plan’s preparer. Number of polygons (drawn for each plan): This ranged from 1 to 35; the higher numbers were usually state agencies making numerous small (1-2 acre) fuelwood or management harvests and filing them under one plan. Note that once approved, an operator has 2 years to perform an approved harvest and may apply for 2, one-year extensions; i.e. a plan approved in 2003 may not be cut until 2005 (or with extensions, until 2007). Data quality control Julie Hall began independently capturing in a heads-up digitizing format a ~ 4% sample of FCPs. These sampled FCPs were compared with the FCP polygons in the original dataset. Results: (1) Differences in area between the FCPs digitized by Burk and Hall are unsystematic, with neither source being consistently higher or lower, and uncorrelated, so that errors tend to cancel when areas of FCPs are added across the state?. On average (median), for any FCP the two sources are 18% different in area. (2) For any FCP, the median distance from the centroid of Burk’s polygon to Hall’s polygon is 88m. Data acquisition caveats Ch. 132 FCPs were prepared originally by a wide variety of foresters, loggers, and private landowners. There is a minimal standard required by the regulating agency, and the data are required for regulatory purposes, not research. Thus, there is a wide range in quality of FCPs submitted, from maps and volume estimates that are computer generated and prepared by professional foresters with 4, 6, or more years of higher education and years of professional experience, to “back-of-napkin” estimates of volume, area, and spatial location that were barely adequate - but apparently acceptable - for regulatory purposes. The Bureau of Forestry service forester apparently had sufficient information on the plan to make a field visit and ensure compliance with forest practice regulations. Thus there is a considerable range in data quality that the acquirers of data had to contend with as they worked to interpret spatial and tabular information on the plans, and capture it in the database. Artistic rendition of polygons. Harvest areas have not generally been surveyed or ground truthed. The original polygons from the FCPs are the plan preparer’s best estimate of where the harvest took place, for regulatory purposes. In turn, the GIS rendition of a harvest polygon by the data acquirers was their best estimate of where the harvest occurred based on maps and descriptions in the FCPs. There was no field checking, however, on the part of data entry staff. These digitized best estimates of harvest polygon location are thus “best estimates of best estimates”, and thus can not be construed to represent actual truth on the ground - only the best faith effort to characterize spatially where a harvest event occurred. Likewise, preparers of FCPs report their estimate of the area harvested [in acres], but this is merely their estimate. They are not required to survey or use other spatial techniques to determine area. Depending on the plan preparer, the area of harvest may be determined by a dot-grid estimation method, based on tax assessment estimates of area of the property, or be a simple guess to round numbers. It is likely that the estimated spatial extent of the proposed harvest area, as described on the FCP’s maps, provide a better estimate of the spatial extent and thus area, than an estimate of area. Thus, it is probably preferable to use the gis-calculated areas of harvest polygons, rather than the estimated areas reported by plan preparers. Volume estimates are exactly that - estimates. These estimates are required as part of the regulatory process, though nobody officially checks or controls them. And- the FCPs are filed before the harvest as part of an approval process. There is no confirmation of the final volume removed. Chapter 132 only requires submission of a FCP for land that will remain in forest use following the harvest. Thus, a FCP is NOT required for harvest operations that will result in a change of land use, e.g., from forest to developed use. As a result, these data only reflect harvest for areas that have remained in forest, and thus not all harvesting. Chapter 132 requires FCPs submitted for harvest operations greater than 25 Mbf. [from Alerich 2000: 1 Mbf = 3.48 cubic meters. Although 1 Mbf are theoretically equivalent to 2.36 cubic meters, this is true only when a board foot is actually a piece of wood with a volume of 1/12 of a cubic foot. The International ¼-inch log rule is used by the USDA Forest Service in the East to estimate the product potential in board feet. The reliability of the estimate obtained by conversion will vary with the size of the log measured. The conversion of 3.48 cubic meters to 1 Mbf is based on the cubic volume of a log 16 feet long and 15 inches in diameter, inside bark and the small end. Because the board foot unit is not a true measure of wood volume and because products other than dimension lumber are becoming important, this unit may eventually be phased out and replaced by the cubic meter]. Harvest operations commonly remove between 2 and 10 Mbf/acre, resulting in 25 Mbf representing a relatively small area. It is unlikely that a commercial timber sale would remove less than this amount, due to adverse economies of scale. It is possible that small operations will remove less than the threshold amount and still file a FCP, since an approved FCP creates an exemption from the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (MGL Chapter 131). It is improbable that much commercial harvest falls beneath 25 Mbf and this is not accounted for in these FCP data, and indeed, it is quite possible that smaller operations are included due to the advantageous wetlands protection exemption. Some small-scale, non-commercial harvesting (less than 25 Mbf) that does not require FCPs to be filed also occurs on private lands, although the distribution and volume of such harvests is unknown. FCPs only list the official date that they are approved, but they are valid for a two-year period, and are eligible for up to two one-year extensions. Thus, it is difficult to say exactly when the harvest occurred, other than to conclude that it happened within the 2 to 4 year window following date of approval. “Date” thus provides only an approximate indication of the timing of harvest. The upshot of these caveats is this: The more than 13,000 harvest events represent the best estimate or collective characterization of harvest activity that took place between 1984 and 2003 across ownerships throughout Massachusetts (roughly 2.6 million acres of forest, out of a total of 5 Million acres of land). It is possible that any individual event may not be depicted in a spatially accurate way (e.g., either the best estimate of the plan preparer, and / or the best estimate of the data acquirer may result in the depiction of a harvest polygon as spatially inaccurate). Consequently, the data can not be used with confidence to represent specific individual harvest events. It remains however, to our knowledge the best estimate of harvest activity at a broad spatial landscape scale over two decades across the diversity of public and private ownerships typical of Massachusetts and much of the eastern United States.

USDA Forest Service Resource Bulletin NE-148. 104 pp. Further data processing notes To ease data manipulation, the FILE_ID (the code assigned by the state to a cut) was standardized so that all letters are in lower case. For example, “HD9599” was changed to “hd9599”. Previously, the dataset had a mix of lower and upper case letters. Furthermore, the ArcView shapefile PAT was simplified to contain solely the FILE_ID. The boundaries of the polygons are thus saved in the shapefile all_cutting_plans_v3.shp (and related files), while the remaining information that Burk et al. entered was stored in a separate DBF file: plan_info.dbf. A shapefile containing the centroid of all the harvesting polygons was created, for use when graphing information at a statewide level: all_cutting_plans_v3_point (and related files). The varying units of volume in the original dataset (usually MBF, but sometime tons, cords, etc.) were standardized to m3, using published conversion factors. Some FCPs had missing data or unrealistic data, and those FCPs were not included in this calculation. Using the digitized area of the FCP, cutting intensity (m3/ha) was calculated as well. Information is stored in: volume_and_intensity_v4.dbf. The format of this file mirrors that of the original dataset to some extent. The columns are: FILE_ID: the ID code given the plan by the state.

00072-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"As the ecological functioning of a forest stand is often related to the spatial organization of the canopy, we used a portable canopy LiDAR (PCL; Parker et al. 2004) to measure volumetric canopy structure in the simulated HWA management treatments. In September and October 2005, prior to leaf abscission, we set up 16 parallel transects spaced 2 meters apart in the 900 m2 (30 x 30 m) interior of each of the eight treatment plots. The orientation of the transects were either north-south or east-west to minimize the difficulty of traversing the stand. The distances to canopy surfaces more than1 m above the ground along the transects were recorded with the PCL. Assuming a constant horizontal sampling rate, the continual height measures were binned into 1 m intervals. From these measures, vertical canopy profiles, canopy openness, canopy rugosity, and other metrics related to the three-dimensional structure of the canopy can be derived. These canopy measures will be repeated minimally at 5 and 15 year intervals to develop an understanding of early structural dynamics and micrometeorological consequences associated with the simulated HWA treatments.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from North Temperate Lakes (NTL) contains human population (total) measurements in number units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of North Temperate Lakes and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00074-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Locations: Sweeney (SW), West (WE), Clubhead (CL), and Nelson (NE) Flume Nets Each year flume nets (3-4) were installed at roughly equal distances along each creek. The flume nets, installed perpendicularly to the creek channel, consisted of two sides and removable front and back panels. The 6mm mesh net side panels were dug into the marsh so that the marsh surface formed the bottom of the “flume” and attached to PVC stakes at either end. The front (cod end) of the flume was a 3m W x 1.5m H x 3m L conical shaped nylon mesh net that was anchored in the main creek channel to provide a low water refuge for nekton. The back panel was a 3m x 1.5m rectangular net attached to PVC stakes. The size and placement of the nets varied slightly in some years; 2003-2006 flume nets dimensions were 3m W x 10m L x 1.5m H the nets were placed at the creek edge in the low marsh tall Spartina alterniflora (TSA) and extended into the high marsh Spartina patens (SP); 2009-2010 flume nets were 2m W x 5 m L x 1.5 m H and placed in the high marsh (SP) habitat; 2011 flume nets were 3m W x 10m L x 1.5m H and placed in the TSA at the creek edge. Sampling Collection and Processing All flume net collections occurred at night within 48 hrs of the monthly spring tide from June to September. Prior to sampling events the nets were lowered to ensure nekton could freely move in and out of the sampling area. At slack high tide teams quietly approached the nets and deployed them capturing any nekton inside the area of during high tide. As the tide fell nekton were funneled into the code end where they were recovered at low tide. In the lab the nekton were identified to the lowest taxonomic level, measured to the nearest millimeter, and weighed to the nearest 0.01 grams. For fishes total length (TL) was measured from the tip of the snout to the end of the caudal fin. Shrimp TL was measured from the tip of the rostrum to the end of the tail. For crab species the carapace width was measured from its widest point. Fish Exclusion From 2004-2006, as part of a series of experiments to understand the role of fish in food web controls, a barrier designed to prevent the movement of fish was installed in the right branch of SW and WE. The barrier was constructed of wood, PVC, and NITEX and entrenched into the creek bottom and side walls. Fish on the upstream side of the barricade were removed to create and artificially low density. Each year at the end of the season the fish blocks were removed and reinstalled in the spring of the next year."

The principal study site is the Plum Island Sound estuary, its coupled Parker, Rowley and Ipswich River watersheds and the adjacent coastal ocean, the Gulf of Maine. The PIE LTER focuses on how several aspects of global change influence organic matter and inorganic nutrient biogeochemistry and estuarine foodwebs. The inputs of organic matter and nutrients from land, ocean and marshes interact with the external drivers (climate, land use, river discharge, sea level) to dictate the extent and degree of nutrient and organic matter processing and determine the spatial patterns of estuarine productivity and trophic structure. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grants OCE-9726921, OCE-0423565, OCE-1058747, OCE-1238212. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in the material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation. The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER site, is located in northeastern Massachusetts, 42.72 N, 70.85 W. The PIE LTER lies at the interface of a thinly soiled, formerly glaciated New England land mass and the highly productive Gulf of Maine. Three watersheds comprise the estuarine drainage basin: Parker (155 km2), Rowley (26 km2) and Ipswich (404 km2). The Ipswich River watershed is highly urbanized with Boston 'bedroom' communities encroaching in the headwater region while the Parker is less urbanized and retains a higher proportion of forest. -71.2198 -70.7568 42.8276 42.4965 0 100 meter"

00075-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) contains animal abundance of Elassoma evergladei measurements in numberPerEffort units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Please read and agree to the data policy of Florida Coastal Everglades and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Please read and agree to the data policy of Florida Coastal Everglades and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) contains aboveground net primary productivity of Rumex obtusifolius measurements in gramsPerMeterSquaredPerYear units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization.

The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Kellogg Biological Station and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00078-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Sevilleta (SEV) contains plant cover of Chamaesyce revoluta (threadstem sandmat) measurements in percent units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use.

Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Sevilleta and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00079-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) contains animal biomass of Enneacanthus gloriosus measurements in gramsPerSquareMeter units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

00079-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets.

The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged.

00080-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"A quadrat survey was conducted in October 2012 to measure the species and size distribution of plants at 3 sampling sites on the creekbank of the Altamaha River. The sites were chosen to capture the transition from Spartina alterniflora to Spartina cynosuroides (site SCSA) and the transition from Spartina cynosuroides to Zizaniopsis miliacea (sites ZSC1 and ZSC2). The quadrats were established as permanent plots in October 2012 by placing PVC stakes along the creekbank at each site. Plots were evenly spaced, but were not randomly located because the goal was to start with mixtures of vegetation in most of the plots, and vegetation was distributed in patches along the creekbanks. Therefore, these plots provide useful measures of vegetation change, but are not a random sample of the vegetation at the site. Plots will be replaced as needed in future years to replace any lost to disturbance. The plots were visually surveyed and the species, shoot height, and flowering status was recorded individually for each shoot over 10 cm in height present in each plot. Observations from plots exhibiting signs of disturbance were noted in the data set. This survey will be repeated annually to assess changes in plant distribution and biomass in relation to environmental changes documented by other GCE LTER monitoring efforts."

Column data types are validated upon importing the table into MATLAB, and qualifier flags are automatically generated for data values based on QA/QC criteria for each data column pre-defined in metadata templates (e.g. value range checks, sanity checks, pattern checks). Qualifier flags are also assigned to values that are imputed or derived, revised, or otherwise differ from values in the original data submission. A column of coded qualifier flags is generated and included in the data table if flags are assigned to any value in a data column."

Sheldon informationManager The Georgia Coastal Ecosystems (GCE) LTER program, located on the central Georgia coast, was established in 2000. The study domain encompasses three adjacent sounds (Altamaha, Doboy, Sapelo) and includes upland (mainland, barrier islands, marsh hammocks), intertidal (fresh, brackish and salt marsh) and submerged (river, estuary, continental shelf) habitats. Patterns and processes in this complex landscape vary spatially within and between sites, and temporally on multiple scales (tidal, diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Overlain on this spatial and temporal variation are long-term trends caused by climate change, sea level rise, and human alterations of the landscape. These long-term trends are likely to manifest in many ways, including changes in water quality, river discharge, runoff and tidal inundation patterns throughout the estuarine landscape. The overarching goal of the GCE program is to understand the mechanisms by which variation in the quality, source and amount of both fresh and salt water create temporal and spatial variability in estuarine habitats and processes, in order to predict directional changes that will occur in response to long-term shifts in estuarine salinity patterns.

00081-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This LTER Remote Sensing spatial raster dataset consists of LEDAPS corrected Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data for Shortgrass Steppe, originally collected on 1985-10-15 (17:06:15.1930500Z) by Landsat 5, row 032, path 033. Cloud cover was 0 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

00083-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This research was intended to address the general question of whether asexual stem regeneration of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) reduces rates of establishment and growth of potential invading conifer species during the initial years following fire. Interactions between aspen and conifers were studied under natural conditions in a burned aspen stand with a high potential for aspen re-sprouting. The study contributes to our understanding of whether competitive interactions between tree seedlings are likely to help maintain deciduous stands across disturbance cycles by reducing the potential for successful conifer establishment. Vegetation cover measurements made on July 31, 2000. Data are visual estimates of % cover, made in a 1x1m quadrat centered in each plot. Values are listed by species, with T=trace (<0.5%) and Out=present outside the cover quadrat but inside the plot. A key to the species codes listed in the column headers is found in spcode.txt."

00083-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design The experiment was initiated in June 2000, one year after burning. A total of 32 circular, 2-m diameter plots were randomly located along a 10-m wide band within the aspen patch. The original experimental design also included an artificial warming treatment, and aspen removal and warming treatments were randomly assigned to the plots in a 2x3 factorial design (2 removal levels x 3 warming levels), with 6 replicates for each treatment. The warming factor included 3 treatment levels: greenhouse application, control, and a fenced procedural control designed to mimic the exclosure effects of the greenhouses without an effect on microclimate. The greenhouse treatment used an open-topped design that warmed air temperatures primarily by increasing the height of the soil surface boundary layer (Marion et al., 1997). However, the aspen suckers rapidly over-topped the greenhouses, reducing or eliminating their boundary-layer effect. Temperature measurements in the second year of the experiment, taken with shielded thermocouples at 5cm above the ground surface, indicated no effect of greenhouses on daily mean or maximum air temperatures (p>0.1; data not shown). Likewise, both the greenhouses and procedural controls had no effect on the frequency or intensity of herbivory, which was primarily caused by moose and leaf-eating insects. As a result, the warming treatment was discontinued at the end of the second year, leaving 18 plots assigned to each of the aspen removal and control treatments. The aspen-removal treatment consisted of aboveground clipping of all aspen stems, contrasted with a control treatment in which the aspen stems were left intact. Balsam poplar sprouts, which were present in low density in 8 of the 36 plots, were treated the same as aspen. Aspen stems were clipped twice in the first growing season, and once in the second and third growing seasons to maintain the aspen removal treatment. Biomass of the clipped stems was measured in 2000 and at the final harvest in 2002. The experiment was terminated in August 2002, at the end of the third growing season. Each experimental plot was divided into 6 sub-plots consisting of equilateral triangles (area = 0.28 m2) arranged in a hexagon with a 15 cm buffer around the external edge of the main plot. Subplots were randomly assigned to a seedling or control treatment. There were four seedling species treatments: black spruce (BS; Picea mariana), white spruce (WS; Picea glauca), lodgepole pine (LP; Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia), trembling aspen (TA; Populus tremuloides), and two unplanted control treatments. Soil samples and other destructive activities were assigned to one of the control sub-plots, while the other subplot was reserved for non-destructive monitoring of natural seedling establishment. Observations during the experiment indicated that naturally recruited seedlings contributed an estimated 13% (0.2/1.5 seedlings/m2) of black spruce establishment and 8% (0.2/2.4 seedlings/m2) of white spruce establishment observed in the seeded plots. 2000-08-07 2002-09-01 Sampling Frequency monthly-annually"

00083-metadata.xml,Resource Lineage,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Experimental Design The experiment was initiated in June 2000, one year after burning. A total of 32 circular, 2-m diameter plots were randomly located along a 10-m wide band within the aspen patch. The original experimental design also included an artificial warming treatment, and aspen removal and warming treatments were randomly assigned to the plots in a 2x3 factorial design (2 removal levels x 3 warming levels), with 6 replicates for each treatment. The warming factor included 3 treatment levels: greenhouse application, control, and a fenced procedural control designed to mimic the exclosure effects of the greenhouses without an effect on microclimate. The greenhouse treatment used an open-topped design that warmed air temperatures primarily by increasing the height of the soil surface boundary layer (Marion et al., 1997). However, the aspen suckers rapidly over-topped the greenhouses, reducing or eliminating their boundary-layer effect. Temperature measurements in the second year of the experiment, taken with shielded thermocouples at 5cm above the ground surface, indicated no effect of greenhouses on daily mean or maximum air temperatures (p>0.1; data not shown). Likewise, both the greenhouses and procedural controls had no effect on the frequency or intensity of herbivory, which was primarily caused by moose and leaf-eating insects. As a result, the warming treatment was discontinued at the end of the second year, leaving 18 plots assigned to each of the aspen removal and control treatments. The aspen-removal treatment consisted of aboveground clipping of all aspen stems, contrasted with a control treatment in which the aspen stems were left intact. Balsam poplar sprouts, which were present in low density in 8 of the 36 plots, were treated the same as aspen. Aspen stems were clipped twice in the first growing season, and once in the second and third growing seasons to maintain the aspen removal treatment. Biomass of the clipped stems was measured in 2000 and at the final harvest in 2002. The experiment was terminated in August 2002, at the end of the third growing season. Each experimental plot was divided into 6 sub-plots consisting of equilateral triangles (area = 0.28 m2) arranged in a hexagon with a 15 cm buffer around the external edge of the main plot. Subplots were randomly assigned to a seedling or control treatment. There were four seedling species treatments: black spruce (BS; Picea mariana), white spruce (WS; Picea glauca), lodgepole pine (LP; Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia), trembling aspen (TA; Populus tremuloides), and two unplanted control treatments. Soil samples and other destructive activities were assigned to one of the control sub-plots, while the other subplot was reserved for non-destructive monitoring of natural seedling establishment. Observations during the experiment indicated that naturally recruited seedlings contributed an estimated 13% (0.2/1.5 seedlings/m2) of black spruce establishment and 8% (0.2/2.4 seedlings/m2) of white spruce establishment observed in the seeded plots. 2000-08-07 2002-09-01 Sampling Frequency monthly-annually"

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Harvard Forest (HFR) contains farmland acres (total) measurements in acre units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Harvard Forest and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

00085-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"This LTER Remote Sensing spatial raster dataset consists of LEDAPS corrected Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper image data for North Temperate Lakes LTER, originally collected on 1984-05-29 (16:14:15.2650380Z) by Landsat 5, row 028, path 025. Cloud cover was 0 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

00086-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) contains aboveground net primary productivity of Polygonum convolvulus measurements in gramsPerMeterSquaredPerYear units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

00086-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"The source data used to generate this dataset were provided by Kellogg Biological Station, and transformed into a derived product by EcoTrends. Please read and agree to the data policy of Kellogg Biological Station and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Kellogg Biological Station and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon).

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCE) contains sulfur from sulfate in wet deposition measurements in kilogramsPerHectare units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

00089-metadata.xml,Rights,/eml:eml/dataset/intellectualRights,"EcoTrends Data Access Policy, Data Access Requirements, and General Data Use Agreement April 10, 2007 EcoTrends Data Access Policy The EcoTrends data policy follows the LTER data policy by including three specific sections designed to express shared network policies regarding the release of EcoTrends data products, user registration for accessing data, and the licensing agreements specifying the conditions for data use. EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Please read and agree to the data policy of Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average.

To achieve this goal the Arctic LTER uses several approaches: Long-term monitoring and surveys of natural variation of ecosystem characteristics in space and time. Includes: climate, plant communities and productivity, thaw depth, stream flow, chemistry of streams and lakes, temperatures of streams and lakes, lake chlorophyll lake productivity, zooplankton abundance. Experimental manipulation of ecosystems for years and decades. Includes: tundra warming, shading, and fertilizing, grazer exclusions, fertilization of lakes and streams, addition and subtraction of predators. Synthesis of results and predictive modeling at ecosystem and watershed scales. Includes: stream N cycling, lake physics, bioenergetics of fish populations, water movement and transfer of DOC and nutrients from land to water, soil respiration, cycling and storage of C in tundra under different scenarios of future climates.

The Arctic LTER research site (68°N and 149°W) is in the foothills region of the North Slope of Alaska and includes the entire Toolik Lake watershed and the adjacent watershed of the upper Kuparuk River, down to the confluence of these two watersheds. This area is typical of the northern foothills of the Brooks Range, with continuous permafrost, no trees, a complete snow cover for 7 to 9 months, winter ice cover on lakes, streams, and ocean, and cessation of river flow during the winter. Tussock tundra vegetation of sedges and grasses mixed with dwarf birch and low willows form the dominant vegetation type with areas of drier heath tundra on ridge tops and other well-drained sites as well as areas of river-bottom willow communities. -149.75 -149.0433 68.8 68.5 610 1360 meter"

Cloud cover was 0 percent. The Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) software was originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administrationâ€“Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Maryland to produce top-of-atmosphere reflectance from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus Level 1 digital numbers and to apply atmospheric corrections to generate a surface-reflectance product. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted the LEDAPS algorithm for producing the Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record.

00094-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Kellogg Biological Station (KBS) contains aboveground net primary productivity measurements in gramsPerMeterSquaredPerYear units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Please read and agree to the data policy of Kellogg Biological Station and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

Please read and agree to the data policy of Kellogg Biological Station and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale. In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively. Each field is joined in the file name by the underscore _ character. The site, station, and variable fields may contain multiple codes that are joined with the hyphen or dash - character. All derived data product file names end with the .trends.csv extension. The file name is case sensitive so as to avoid confusion between similar codes (e.g., c for Celsius and C for carbon). This convention results in a file name that looks like: SITE_STATION_VARIABLE_UNIT_TIMESCALE.trends.csv An example of a real file name is and_OR10_smax-10cm_c_monthly.trends.csv, which decodes to maximum soil temperature recorded in degrees Celsius subsurface at 10cm located at the Andrews LTER, using soil sensor station OR10, and with data aggregated to a monthly average. Data are converted from the raw (site) schema to a global schema that includes: (1) Date stamp for either the year (YYYY), and if the month exists (MM); (2) Observation value, (3) Number of raw observations used in aggregate, (4) Standard Deviation of Aggregate population, (5) Standard Error of Aggregate population, (6) Proportion Missing of Aggregate population, (7) Proportion Questionable of Aggregate population, (8) Proportion Estimated of Aggregate population, (9) Proportion Trace Measurement of Aggregate population (precipation data only), (10) Proportion Ivalid of Aggregate population, and (11) Comments for the Aggregate population."

00095-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"Process-based models of plant litter decomposition typically underestimate the rates of decomposition in arid and semi-arid grasslands. Recent research, including our field studies, suggests that photodegradation, the decomposition of material through solar radiation, may play an important role in arid and semi-arid grassland ecosystems. The contribution of photodegradation to overall rates of decomposition is not well understood or quantified. The goal of this project is to investigate the effects of ultraviolet radiation on rates of plant litter decomposition for two grass species, Andropogon gerardii and Bouteloua gracilis, in three grassland sites: Cedar Creek (MN), Shortgrass Steppe (CO), and Sevilleta (NM)."

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Central Arizona - Phoenix Urban LTER (CAP) contains sulfur from sulfate in streamwater measurements in milligramsPerLiter units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata.

In addition, the symbols NA and UNK may be used to signify a field that has nothing applicable or a field where the content is unknown, respectively.

The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA).

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below). This document specifies general roles and the obligations and rights enjoyed by each regarding the use of most dataset released for general public use. This document may be updated as the LTER data policy is updated in the future to ensure compliance with the LTER policy. General Data Use Agreement Definitions Dataset - Digital data and its metadata derived from any research activity such as field observations, collections, laboratory analysis, experiments, or the post-processing of existing data and identified by a unique identifier issued by a recognized cataloging authority such as a site, university, agency, or other organization. Data User - individual to whom access has been granted to this Dataset, including his or her immediate collaboration sphere, defined here as the institutions, partners, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, and with whom access must be granted, in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Dataset Dataset Creator - individual or institution that produced the Dataset Dataset Owner - individual or institution that holds intellectual property rights to the dataset. Note that this may or may not be defined as a legal copyright. If no other party is designated in the metadata as Dataset Owner, it may be presumed that these rights are held by the Dataset Creator. Dataset Distributor - individual or institution providing access to the Datasets. Dataset Contact - party designated in the accompanying metadata of the Dataset as the primary contact for the Dataset. Conditions of Use The re-use of scientific data has the potential to greatly increase communication, collaboration and synthesis within and among disciplines, and thus is fostered, supported and encouraged. Permission to use this dataset is granted to the Data User free of charge subject to the following terms: 1) Acceptable use. Use of the dataset will be restricted to academic, research, educational, government, recreational, or other not-for-profit professional purposes. The Data User is permitted to produce and distribute derived works from this dataset provided that they are released under the same license terms as those accompanying this Dataset. Any other uses for the Dataset or its derived products will require explicit permission from the dataset owner. 2 ) Redistribution. The data are provided for use by the Data User. The metadata and this license must accompany all copies made and be available to all users of this Dataset. The Data User will not redistribute the original Dataset beyond this collaboration sphere. 3 ) Citation. It is considered a matter of professional ethics to acknowledge the work of other scientists. Thus, the Data User will properly cite the Dataset in any publications or in the metadata of any derived data products that were produced using the Dataset. Citation should take the following general form: Creator, Year of Data Publication, Title of Dataset, Publisher, Dataset identifier. 4 ) Acknowledgement. The Data User should acknowledge any institutional support or specific funding awards referenced in the metadata accompanying this dataset in any publications where the Dataset contributed significantly to its content. Acknowledgements should identify the supporting party, the party that received the support, and any identifying information such as grant numbers. 5 ) Notification. The Data User will notify the Dataset Contact when any derivative work or publication based on or derived from the Dataset is distributed. The Data User will provide the data contact with two reprints of any publications resulting from use of the Dataset and will provide copies, or on-line access to, any derived digital products. Notification will include an explanation of how the Dataset was used to produce the derived work. 6 ) Collaboration. The Dataset has been released in the spirit of open scientific collaboration. Data Users are thus strongly encouraged to consider consultation, collaboration and/or co-authorship with the Dataset Creator. By accepting this Dataset, the Data User agrees to abide by the terms of this agreement. The Data Owner shall have the right to terminate this agreement immediately by written notice upon the Data User's breach of, or non-compliance with, any of its terms. The Data User may be held responsible for any misuse that is caused or encouraged by the Data User's failure to abide by the terms of this agreement. Disclaimer While substantial efforts are made to ensure the accuracy of data and documentation contained in the datasets discovered on the EcoTrends website, complete accuracy of data and metadata cannot be guaranteed. All data and metadata are made available as is. The Data User holds all parties involved in the production or distribution of the Dataset harmless for damages resulting from its use or interpretation.

Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project.

00098-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"The EcoTrends project was established in 2004 by Dr. Debra Peters (Jornada Basin LTER, USDA-ARS Jornada Experimental Range) and Dr. Ariel Lugo (Luquillo LTER, USDA-FS Luquillo Experimental Forest) to support the collection and analysis of long-term ecological datasets. The project is a large synthesis effort focused on improving the accessibility and use of long-term data. At present, there are ~50 state and federally funded research sites that are participating and contributing to the EcoTrends project, including all 26 Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites and sites funded by the USDA Agriculture Research Service (ARS), USDA Forest Service, US Department of Energy, US Geological Survey (USGS) and numerous universities. Data from the EcoTrends project are available through an exploratory web portal (http://www.ecotrends.info). This web portal enables the continuation of data compilation and accessibility by users through an interactive web application. Ongoing data compilation is updated through both manual and automatic processing as part of the LTER Provenance Aware Synthesis Tracking Architecture (PASTA). The web portal is a collaboration between the Jornada LTER and the LTER Network Office. The following dataset from Florida Coastal Everglades (FCE) contains animal density of Cichlasoma urophthalma measurements in numberPerMeterSquared units and were aggregated to a yearly timescale."

EcoTrends Data Release Policy Data and information made available to the EcoTrends project are accessible online with as few restrictions as possible, on a nondiscriminatory basis. EcoTrends participating scientists should make every effort to release data with attention to accurate and complete metadata. Data All data made available to the public via the EcoTrends website are to be released to the general public according to the terms of the general data use agreement below. While the spirit of this document is to promote maximum availability for ecological data, there are criteria by which priority for data release may be determined. Aggregated or otherwise processed data with complete metadata have highest priority. Other types of data including student thesis data or legacy data that already suffer from inadequate documentation or format obsolescence may be ranked a lower priority by a site with justifications provided in their data management policy. Finally, some data may be determined of lowest priority for archiving on the grounds that they are interim data that led to final products that carry the scientific value. These might include data files created during stages within an analytic workflow, raw or replicate data values that were subsequently aggregated or processed for release, or individual outputs from stochastic models. EcoTrends does not store or distribute datasets with distribution or use restrictions imposed by the data owner(s). Metadata 1. Metadata documenting archived/online data sets of all types listed above will be made available when, or before, the dataset itself is released according to the terms above. 2. All metadata will be publicly available. 3. All metadata will follow Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network recommended standards and will minimally contain adequate information on proper citation, access, contact information, and discovery. Complete information including methods, structure, semantics, and quality control/assurance is expected for most datasets and is strongly encouraged. EcoTrends Data Access Requirements The access to all EcoTrends data is subject to requirements set forth by this policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use. These requirements are standardized to provide contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: Registration 1. Name 2. Affiliation 3. Email Address 4. Full Contact Information Acceptance of the General Public Use Agreement A Statement of Intended Use that is compliant with the above agreements. Such statements may be made submitted explicitly or made implicitly via the data access portal interface. Data Use Agreements Datasets released by EcoTrends will be accompanied by the General Data Use Agreement (see below).

Please read and agree to the data policy of Florida Coastal Everglades and the EcoTrends Data Policy before using these data in any analyses and/or publications. Metadata describing these derived data were provided by the LTER Network Office and EcoTrends. These data are produced as part of the EcoTrends project. This phase of the EcoTrends project produces derived data through a manual process of inputing raw (site) data through an R (the R statistical programming language) script, which converts input data from the raw schema to the global schema. This process produces a file that uses a canonical naming convention that contains keyword nomenclature used to generate attribute level metadata. The proposed and agreed upon file naming convention used for derived data products encodes the following information into the name: (1) site(s) code, (2) station(s) code, (3) variable, (4) unit, and (5) timescale.

00099-metadata.xml,Abstract,/eml:eml/dataset/abstract,"There are relatively few studies that have examined forest structure and composition both before and after a catastrophic wind disturbance has altered the forest. On a twenty acre parcel of old-growth forest located in the Pisgah State Forest in southwest New Hampshire, the collection of a long term data set from 1907-1995 has made it possible to consider how the hurricane of 1938 altered forest structure, species composition, and subsequent forest development in the stand. Various types of information were gathered throughout the century that allowed the quantification of forest structure and composition: species identification, diameter measurements, tree status (living or dead), tree cores, and individual tree growth and mortality have recently been tracked. The old-growth forest before 1938 was dominated by a Pinus-Tsuga-Hardwood mix. The hurricane left the forest devastated and incredibly altered. The total basal area of the forest was drastically reduced from approximately 70m2/ha to about 5m2/ha after the disturbance. White pine was effectively lost from the stand while many large Tsuga were also blown down. A large increase in density was subsequently recorded as many post-disturbance species took advantage of the resources that had been made available, especially light. Although there was a high level of destruction, a good amount of Tsuga and Fagus that had previously existed in the understory was released from suppression and grew to fill in parts of the overstory. Both the forest structure and the species composition changed from a relatively homogeneous state before the hurricane to an extremely heterogeneous one after the hurricane. The overall development of the stand followed the typical path of a recently disturbed area: after the initial increase in density in the few years after the storm, basal area has been steadily increasing while density has steadily decreased. It has also been possible to observe differences in the ability of individual species to react to the hurricane. Tsuga and Fagus are exhibiting a much-increased ability to remain in the stand while other post-disturbance species such as Betula and Acer are suffering much higher mortality. Although the forest already has very low tree species diversity, it will continue to drop with time as more and more of the post-disturbance hardwoods are lost to mortality."

00099-metadata.xml,Process Step,/eml:eml/dataset/methods,"Data available on-line are from 14, 20m x 20m permanent plots established in 1984. Data collected include tree diameters, abundance of regeneration (saplings, seedlings and sprouts), understory flora abundance, and measurements of trees windthrown in 1938. Notes on tree measurements: There has been inconsistency in the methods used to record forked trees. The method used in 1984 is not known. In 1990 and from 2000 on, stems forking below breast height were listed as separate stems in the data files. However, in 1995, stems forking below breast height were lumped. In cases of forked trees, the diameter of each fork was measured and the sum of these was recorded as one diameter measurement on the field data sheet (e.g., in one case. a tagged birch in 1990 had a diameter of 12cm or so, in 1995 a diameter of 54cm and in 2000 of about 14cm. When the data sheet was checked, it just listed the diameter as 54 cm, stating in parentheses that this included 4 stems). Therefore, the stem counts in 1995 are not directly comparable to the other years, and the basal area calculations for 1995 are inflated. Original data sheets for 1995 and 2000 were examined closely and a revised version of the 1995 tree data was created. This revised file is the one included in the Web Data Catalog. In this revised file, diameters for all multiple-stemmed trees that could be found were split into separate diameter measurements, so that basal area calculations would be more accurate and data more comparable among sample years. However, since most trees are not tracked as individuals, it is likely that some problems still remain in the 1995 tree data file."
